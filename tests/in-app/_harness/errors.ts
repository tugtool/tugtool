/**
 * errors.ts — Harness error classes.
 *
 * Mirrors Spec [#s02-error-classes] from `roadmap/tugplan-in-app-bridge.md`.
 * Structured errors let test authors `catch (e) { if (e instanceof
 * TimeoutError) ... }` without string-matching on messages.
 *
 * Error translation rule: the Swift side serializes errors as
 * `{ ok: false, error: { name, message, stack? } }`. The harness's RPC
 * client (see `./rpc.ts`) reads `error.name` and throws the matching
 * class. Unknown names fall back to a plain `Error` with the server's
 * message preserved.
 *
 * Classes here are intentionally minimal — just the fields tests will
 * actually branch on. `name` is a readonly literal so `switch` on
 * `e.name` works for codegen-generated clients that can't use
 * `instanceof` across bundle boundaries.
