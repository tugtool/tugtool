/**
 * at0181-keymap-chord-sweep.test.ts — native key equivalents derived from
 * the keymap registry.
 *
 * `tugapp/Sources` holds no `performKeyEquivalent` override, no `NSEvent`
 * monitor and no `keyDown` override, so every native key claim in Tug is an
 * `NSMenuItem` key equivalent. That is what makes `applyCommandChords` — the
 * recursive sweep over `NSApp.mainMenu` that writes what the frontend's
 * command registry states — complete coverage of the native side rather than
 * a partial measure.
 *
 * What this pins, through the real validated menu:
 *
 *   - **Apply.** An item whose command states a chord carries the converted
 *     form, character *and* mask. The shifted-punctuation case (⌘+) is the
 *     one worth having: `Equal` + shift converts to the character `+` with
 *     shift dropped from the mask, and computing the two apart is exactly
 *     how ⌘+ renders as ⇧⌘= instead.
 *   - **Detach.** A command that claims its chord only while applicable
 *     publishes a release, and the item ends up with no key equivalent at
 *     all. A chord left on a dimmed item is eaten at the menu bar with a
 *     beep instead of falling through, so this is the difference between
 *     "inapplicable here" and "dead everywhere".
 *   - **Absent.** An item whose chord the registry does not state keeps the
 *     literal it was built with — the sweep is not a second author on chords
 *     the host already owns.
 *   - **Survival across a rebuild.** The View menu `removeAllItems()` and
 *     reconstructs from construction-time literals on every open, and the
 *     menu-state push only fires on a changed projection — so the sweep runs
 *     at the tail of the rebuild too, or a rebuilt item silently reverts and
 *     stays reverted until some unrelated state change comes along.
 *
 * The arrow and four-modifier conversions are unit-tested against the real
 * table (`codeToKeyEquivalent` round-trips every code the registry binds);
 * they belong to transcript-navigation commands that need a live session to
 * validate enabled, which is not something this harness can seed. What is
 * asserted here is that those items reach the gate at all — they detach.
 *
 * Gating: `describe.skipIf(!SHOULD_RUN)`.
