/**
 * at0109-focus-ring.test.ts — the single app-owned focus ring (focus-ring.css +
 * the --tugx-focus-ring-* theme tokens).
 *
 * One ring, on the keyboard-active control: it appears on **keyboard** focus and
 * never on a mouse click. The key view is engine state projected to the DOM as
 * `data-key-view` — internal plumbing with no visual of its own. The ring paints
 * only when that key view is *keyboard-reached* (`data-key-view-kbd`), the mark
 * the engine sets when the Tab walk (not a pointer) lands the key view.
 *
 * Under the keyboard-as-engine-state model, DOM focus rests on the app's
 * `tug-key-sink`, not on the clicked control — the engine routes keys off the
 * sink and derives the key view from its own register, so a control's ring is a
 * function of engine state, not of `document.activeElement`. The two halves:
 *
 *   - a **mouse click** parks a key view (pointer modality) on the card's
 *     focusable — `data-key-view` is set, but it is NOT `data-key-view-kbd`, so
 *     no ring paints (outline width 0). The keyboard is the engine's, not the
 *     control's;
 *   - a **keyboard** Tab drives the engine walk onto a registered focusable and
 *     marks that key view keyboard-reached (`data-key-view-kbd`), so the ring
 *     paints.
 *
 * The click half asserts "the keyboard is not on the control" plus a clean
 * tripwire, not "`activeElement` is the sink". The sink is one legal register
 * among several: a bare `<body>` left behind by the browser's own mousedown
 * default is equally legal and is what actually settles here, so pinning the
 * sink specifically was asserting a mechanism the engine never promised.
 *
 * Outline width is read from `getComputedStyle` in the real WKWebView, where the
 * ring's `data-key-view-kbd` styling actually resolves.
