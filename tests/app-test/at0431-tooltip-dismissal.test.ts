/**
 * at0431-tooltip-dismissal.test.ts — a tooltip is an answer to a question the
 * user stops asking the moment they act.
 *
 * A bubble stands while the pointer rests on something and the user is still
 * wondering what it is. Press, right-click, or scroll and the wondering is
 * over: the press has an outcome to watch, the right-click raises a menu about
 * the very same target, the scroll moves the target out from under the pointer.
 * A bubble that outlives any of those is stale ink sitting on top of the thing
 * the user actually wanted to see.
 *
 * The right-click case is the sharp one, and the reason this file exists: a
 * context menu and a tooltip on screen together are two floating surfaces
 * describing the same target, one of them no longer true. That pairing must be
 * impossible, not merely brief — so the assertion here is made at the moment
 * the menu is standing, and it reads BOTH facts in one breath: the menu is up,
 * and the trigger no longer claims a bubble.
 *
 * Why the trigger's `aria-describedby` rather than the bubble's presence: a
 * closing Radix tooltip stays mounted for its exit animation, and a background
 * app-test window runs no rAF ([L13] / the harness's animation rule), so
 * waiting for the node to leave the DOM could wait forever. The attribute is
 * the trigger's own statement that a bubble is standing, and it clears with
 * the state change rather than with the animation.
 *
 * The three gestures are driven as the real thing, not as a simulation of one:
 * a trusted native click and a trusted native right-click through the harness,
 * and a scroll produced by actually scrolling the editor's scroller — which is
 * what emits the `scroll` event the dismissal listens for.
