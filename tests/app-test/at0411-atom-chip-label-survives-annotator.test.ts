/**
 * at0411-atom-chip-label-survives-annotator.test.ts — an atom chip keeps its
 * label after the annotator has run over the ink around it.
 *
 * ## The regression this pins
 *
 * A submitted prompt renders as markdown with its atom chips portalled back
 * in at their `U+FFFC` positions. A chip is an inline `<svg>`: a rect, a
 * glyph, and a `<text>` holding the label, at a width the renderer measured
 * that label at.
 *
 * The content annotator's text scan walked into that `<svg>`. A chip whose
 * value is a *relative* workspace path (`@`-mention completions are relative)
 * gets no annotation on its host — `payloadForAtom` marks absolute paths —
 * so nothing told the scan to stay out. It found the label, the resolver
 * confirmed the file, and the run was wrapped in an HTML `<span>`: a
 * foreign-namespace element inside an SVG, which paints nothing. The chip
 * kept its measured width and lost every character in it. An empty atom.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 *   1. A real file at a real relative path inside a temp project, and a
 *      session whose `cwd` is that project — so the resolver can confirm.
 *   2. Replay one user turn that names the file twice: once as a mention
 *      marker (which renders as the chip) and once as bare prose. The prose
 *      reference is what makes the body await a verdict, and awaiting one is
 *      what brings the pass back after the chips have been grafted in — the
 *      only moment at which the scan can reach a chip at all.
 *   3. Wait on that prose run: it becomes a wrapped, annotated span. That is
 *      proof the verdict landed and the wrapping pass ran a second time —
 *      without it a green result would only mean the annotator never got an
 *      answer.
 *   4. Assert the chip's `<text>` still holds its characters directly: the
 *      label verbatim, and NO element children. Wrapping leaves `textContent`
 *      intact (the span holds the same characters), so the element count is
 *      the assertion that separates painted text from invisible text.
 *
 * Gating: `describe.skipIf(!SHOULD_RUN)`.
