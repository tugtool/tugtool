/**
 * version-handshake.test.ts — Version-skew regression test for the
 * `version` RPC handshake. Covers harness test:
 *
 *   "Version-skew test: harness with wrong expected version
 *    → throws VersionSkewError."
 *
 * The harness's compile-time constant `EXPECTED_SURFACE_VERSION` is
 * fixed at build time, so to exercise mismatch without a Swift
 * rebuild the test injects a deliberately-wrong `expectedSurfaceVersion`
 * into `launchTugApp`. The handshake compares majors; anything whose
 * major doesn't match the server's (currently `1.0.0` → major `1`)
 * throws.
 *
 * Skipped by default unless `TUGAPP_APP_TEST=1` is set. The test
 * needs a built debug Tug.app binary at the default path (or
 * `TUGAPP_DEBUG_PATH` pointing at one).
 *
 * To run locally:
 *   xcodebuild -scheme Tug -configuration Debug build
 *   TUGAPP_APP_TEST=1 bun test tests/app-test/version-handshake.test.ts
 *
 * Design notes:
 * - The test must NOT leave a live subprocess behind if the throw
 *   path works. `launchTugApp` SIGTERM's the subprocess before
 *   throwing `VersionSkewError`; we assert that by reading the
 *   error's `expected` / `actual` fields and checking the socket
 *   path is unlinked (the `process.on("exit")` cleanup will run on
 *   the next tick).
