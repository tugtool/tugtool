/**
 * at0282 — the `tug-quiesce` canary: a normal teardown fires no SIGKILL.
 *
 * The shutdown contract (roadmap/graceful-termination-plan.md, grounds in
 * [LR3]/[LR4]) says every Tug service gets a flush window before anything
 * forceful happens: on quiesce it stops accepting work, checkpoints its
 * ledgers, and exits 0 inside its own 2 s budget; the conductor (Tug.app)
 * waits 4 s for the group to drain and only then escalates. A SIGKILL
 * that actually fires is a defect — it means some service was cut off
 * mid-flush, which is exactly how a WAL is left for the next process to
 * recover instead of being closed cleanly.
 *
 * So this test does the most ordinary thing possible — launch, then quit
 * through the real `applicationShouldTerminate` path — and reads the
 * app's own account of that shutdown (`quiesce-report.json`, written by
 * `ProcessManager.stop()`). The assertion is that `sigkills` is empty.
