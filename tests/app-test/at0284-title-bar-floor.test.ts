/**
 * at0284-title-bar-floor.test.ts — a title bar is never above the deck top.
 *
 * The rule (DeckState invariant 7): a pane whose `position.y` is negative puts
 * its title bar where nothing can reach it. The deck does not scroll, so that
 * title bar cannot be grabbed and the pane can never be moved back — the user
 * is simply stuck with a card they cannot address.
 *
 * The drag gesture has always clamped, but a gesture is one writer among many.
 * The floor therefore lives at `DeckManager.notify` — the single commit point
 * every mutation passes through — so a layout restored from disk, a detach, or
 * an arrange lands on the deck too. This test drives the restore path, which is
 * the one that used to be able to persist a bad `y` and reinstate it on every
 * launch.
 *
 * Imposed panes are the other half of the rule and are checked here too. Their
 * frame is derived, not stored: the imposer pins them a gap below the canvas
 * top in CSS, so for them the law holds by construction. Since Tug takes an
 * active hand in placing them, that is asserted rather than assumed.
 *
