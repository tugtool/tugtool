/**
 * at0333-changes-hunk-ids.test.ts — hunk identity from git to the DOM.
 *
 * A hunk election is only as trustworthy as the id it names, and that id is
 * computed in Rust and nowhere else: the deck receives it alongside the diff
 * text and never re-derives one. This drives the whole path over the real
 * aggregate and a really-dirty checkout — edit one tracked file in two places
 * far enough apart that git emits two hunks, expand its row in the Changes
 * shade, and assert the rendered hunk bands carry distinct server-supplied
 * ids, one per hunk, in order.
 *
 * The dirty file is an existing *tracked* file, deliberately: the diff wire
 * serves no ids for a created file, whose chunk it synthesizes from
 * `--no-index` rather than reading out of the index — the landing engine
 * cannot address such a hunk, so the deck must not be handed one to offer.
 * The file's bytes are captured before the edit and restored afterwards.
 *
 * It then drives what those ids are *for* on this row: fold one band, make a
 * new hunk appear above it, and assert the fold stayed on the hunk the user
 * folded rather than migrating onto the slot its index now names — collapse
 * state keys by content id, not by position. A marker attribute stamped on the
 * live `data-slot="diff-body"` node before the edit says the diff body also
 * survived the transition without remounting.
 *
 * The recompose needs a second, newly-dirty file, not just the edit: an
 * entry's inline diff is requested once per *path set*, so editing an
 * already-dirty file's bytes does not refetch it. A file entering the entry
 * does — the production shape of "something else went dirty while the shade
 * was open".
 *
 * **What that mount assertion does and does not cover.** It pins `DiffBlock`'s
 * mount identity and the id-keyed collapse, both real things to hold. It is
 * **not** a regression guard on the one-diff-body unification: `election` is
 * `undefined` on every entry kind but `session`, so on the unattributed row
 * this harness can reach, `fileBlockBody` renders one component type both
 * before and after that change and a test here cannot fail on it. That fix is
 * guarded by the mount-identity triple stated in its commit body and by
 * at0334, which drives a seeded session-entry row. Do not read the assertion
 * as covering more than it does.
 *
 * **Not driven here:** the election checkbox and the partial landing. Those
 * render on *session-entry* rows, which this file does not seed — at0334 does,
 * via `app.seedLedger()`, and drives the checkbox, the `N of M hunks` badge,
 * and the stale-election signal there. The landing itself is covered at the
 * Rust round-trip layer (`commit.rs`: elected hunk lands alone, mixed
 * whole+partial landing, drift refusal, dirty-index refusal;
 * `feeds/changeset.rs`: the `changeset_commit` election round trip).
