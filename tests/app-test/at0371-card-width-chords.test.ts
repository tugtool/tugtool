/**
 * at0371-card-width-chords.test.ts — ⌃⌘1/2/3 sets the focused card's width,
 * and only the focused card's.
 *
 * Width had one door before this: the title bar's width popup, which is a
 * mouse trip for a property you retune while reading ([D130]). The chords are
 * a second door onto the same act, and the claim worth pinning end to end is
 * that they are the SAME act — the chord lands on `set-card-width` and gets
 * the clamp and the `widthPreset` stamp from it, rather than reaching
 * `movePane` with a raw number of its own. A separate path would look right
 * on a plain content pane and diverge exactly where the popup's rules bite.
 *
 * What the assertions are chosen to catch:
 *
 *  1. **The digit is an index into the preset order, not into a table
 *     somebody typed twice.** All three are pressed, so a transposed pair
 *     fails rather than passing on the one that happens to match.
 *  2. **It is per-card.** The deck's Card Width default reaches every content
 *     pane at once (at0357); this must not. The second pane is measured after
 *     every press, and holds its seeded width to the pixel.
 *  3. **It moves with the selection.** Focus goes to the second card and the
 *     next press lands there while the first card keeps the width it had, so
 *     the chord is reading the selection at press time rather than latching
 *     the pane it first found. (It does NOT distinguish "first responder's
 *     pane" from "last pane in z-order": every raise path writes
 *     `activePaneId` and moves the pane to the end of the array in one
 *     commit, so those name the same pane — the invariant `stackDepth`
 *     rests on in `host-menu-state.ts`. A probe swapping one for the other
 *     passes, and the docblock says so rather than claiming a guarantee
 *     this fixture cannot make.)
 *  4. **A rail is inert.** A sidebar's width is the allocator's answer, never
 *     a preset ([P04]), which is the same condition the title bar hides its
 *     popup behind. Selecting the Lens and pressing the chord has to move
 *     nothing — and the Lens is the pane that would be most visibly wrong.
 *
 * Widths are read off the painted frame rather than the store, which is what
 * makes this an app-test rather than a unit test: slim (675) and comfy (800)
 * both fit any canvas the harness launches at, and wide (1230) is asserted
 * against the same rect so a canvas too narrow to hold it would fail loudly
 * rather than silently proving nothing. `gallery-accordion` carries no size
 * policy tighter than the presets, so no clamp is in play here — the clamp
 * itself is at0357's fixture and the store's own tests.
 *
 * The chords are pressed natively, so this exercises the whole four-layer
 * resolution: AppKit's key-equivalent scan on the Window items the sweep
 * wrote, the round-trip back through `set-pane-width`, the parameterized
 * command, and the canvas handler. It deliberately does NOT claim
 * `AppDelegate.swift` — that file is already at its accepted fan-out, and
 * the Swift half of this gesture (the item, its identifier, the swept key
 * equivalent) is pinned by `at0181-keymap-chord-sweep` rather than here.
