/**
 * at0335-scroll-displacement.test.ts — the scroller belongs to the user.
 *
 * A browser clamp is the one actor that moves `scrollTop` with no
 * JavaScript involved: when the scroll maximum shrinks, even for an
 * instant, the browser pulls the position down to meet it and does not
 * put it back when the height returns. Under transcript eviction that
 * happened constantly — a window swap removed rows in React's mutation
 * phase and grew the spacer back in a layout effect, so anything that
 * read geometry in between forced layout against a document short by
 * the evicted rows' full extent.
 *
 * The aftermath is what the user actually saw. `SmartScroll` read the
 * clamp as a person scrubbing upward and released follow-bottom, and
 * every route back required the user to move — so one clamp anywhere
 * in a session ended follow-bottom for the rest of it.
 *
 * The defense is the extent floor: an element that pins the scrollable
 * extent so it cannot dip mid-mutation, making the clamp impossible by
 * construction. The commit bracket that once repaired displacements is
 * now an assertion layer — it witnesses a `scrollTop` the machine
 * cannot account for, attributes it (`noteExternalWrite`, so intent
 * rules never read the browser's move as the user), and records it
 * loudly as a defect. It never counter-writes the position.
 *
 * | Test               | What would break without it                        |
 * |--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
 * | counter published  | displacement is invisible; the next scroll defect  |
 * |                    | has to be diagnosed live through `/api/eval` again |
 * | clamp detected     | the detector is dead code — with the floor in      |
 * |                    | place a real clamp no longer occurs to exercise it |
 * | clamp witnessed    | a hole in the floor gets silently counter-written  |
 * |                    | instead of recorded, and the evidence is destroyed |
 * | window swaps clean | the tear is back: re-windowing displaces the user  |
 * | wheel reaches      | a downward gesture gets snapped back partway and   |
 * |                    | cannot reach the live edge                         |
 * | clamp never flips  | a machine displacement is read as user intent and  |
 * |                    | disengages follow-bottom                           |
 * | quiet arrival      | a turn appended after a long idle never scrolls in |
 * | idle recovery      | a user parked at the bottom with follow-bottom off |
 * |                    | is stranded — no gesture, no scroll event, no way  |
 * |                    | back, and every append silently fails to arrive    |
 *
 * **The success criterion is ZERO.** On every real drive — the
 * sixty-turn stand-up, the window swaps, the wheel run, the quiet
 * spell — `data-scroll-displacements` reads `"0"` and the trace ring
 * holds no records. The extent floor makes the clamp impossible by
 * construction, so a record is a defect, never a tolerance to measure
 * against. Earlier revisions pinned magnitude instead, because
 * eviction's ledger-settle dips produced honest ~24px records; the
 * floor spans those dips now, and a magnitude band would only give a
 * regression room to hide in. Only the `forceCommitClamp`-driven
 * tests see a nonzero count, because they take the floor down and
 * manufacture the record deliberately.
 *
 * The clamp cases are driven through `__tug.forceCommitClamp()`, which
 * reproduces a genuine browser clamp from *inside* a React commit.
 * `evalJS` runs outside any commit and so cannot produce one from the
 * outside.
