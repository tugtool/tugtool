/**
 * at0292 — a settled deck writes nothing.
 *
 * The idle contract: an idle deck schedules zero rendering updates. Renderer
 * busy is `rendering updates per second × cost per update`, and the prior
 * phase spent itself on the cost term while the wake term went unmeasured —
 * so this test gates the wake term directly, where it can be seen. A DOM
 * write is the wake: assigning `textContent` replaces the text node and
 * setting an attribute to the value it already holds is still delivered as a
 * mutation, and either one dirties style and schedules an update for a
 * display that did not change. On the deck this seeds, the measured cost of
 * one such update is ~10ms, so a single 4Hz writer nobody notices is ~4% of
 * a core, forever.
 *
 * The deck is a cold-restored `session-transcript-basic` — 29 tool calls,
 * ~1,470 elements — settled and then left alone. Measured 2026-07-29 at 0
 * writes per 5s window, twice, before this gate was written; it is holding a
 * line that is already true, which is the only kind of line worth holding.
 *
 * Two things make it non-vacuous. A deliberate write is performed first and
 * the census must count it, so a census that silently stopped observing
 * fails instead of reading a comfortable zero. And the transcript's own dot
 * population is asserted, so a restore that quietly produced an empty
 * transcript cannot pass by having nothing to write.
 *
 * The measured window reopens once before failing. The app-test workspace is
 * transient and its changeset entries retire on a clock of their own, so a
 * window can catch the tail of that churn even after the settle; one such
 * window was observed in roughly eight runs. A deck that is genuinely writing
 * fails both windows, so the retry costs no strictness — and both are printed
 * when they disagree, which is what would name the writer next time.
 *
 * The waker assertion is narrower than the write assertion on purpose: the
 * perf monitor's own 1Hz heartbeat is a `setTimeout` chain that exists only
 * in dev and test builds, so what is asserted is that no repeating INTERVAL
 * fires at rest — which is the shape every waker convicted so far has had.
