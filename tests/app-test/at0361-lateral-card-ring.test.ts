/**
 * at0361-lateral-card-ring.test.ts — ⇧⌘] / ⇧⌘[ walk the whole deck, Lens
 * included.
 *
 * The lateral axis of card navigation ([D129]) is one ring over every
 * *visible* card position: each tab of each pane the user can see. Two
 * things about that are worth a real chord round-trip rather than a unit
 * test, and this file is the two of them.
 *
 * **It crosses pane boundaries.** Previous/Next Card used to walk one pane's
 * tabs and stop at its edges, with a separate ⌃` Cycle Panes for hopping
 * panes; retiring that command is only honest if the lateral pair now
 * reaches the next pane by itself. So the walk here goes tab → tab inside a
 * pane and then *out* of it, and the assertion is which card holds focus
 * after each press, read through `getFocusedCardId` — the composite first
 * responder, not a class on a frame.
 *
 * **The sidebars are on it.** The Lens is the card most likely to be on
 * screen at any moment and it was the one the first cut skipped, by analogy
 * to `move-to-slot`'s exclusion — which is a fact about *slots*, a thing no
 * sidebar takes. Jots, with no such special case, rode the ring the whole
 * time, so the deck had two sidebars with two behaviors. The ring's
 * membership rules are pinned exactly at the unit layer
 * (`lib/__tests__/card-ring.test.ts`); what this adds is that the real
 * chord, resolved by AppKit and round-tripped through the responder chain,
 * actually lands focus in the Lens.
 *
 * Why a seeded deck rather than the default one: the ring's order is
 * structural — left rail, slots by number, free panes, right rail — so a
 * test that did not state the arrangement would be asserting against
 * whatever the default layout happened to be.
