/**
 * at0293 — typing does not drop a frame.
 *
 * "Won't lag" has to be a number that fails CI, and this is the number:
 * inter-frame gap, measured by a `requestAnimationFrame` loop running while
 * 240 synthetic keystrokes go into the composer of a cold-restored heavy
 * transcript. A rendering update that fits the frame budget leaves the gap at
 * the display's period; one that overruns stretches a frame, and there is
 * nowhere else for that cost to hide.
 *
 * WHY NOT KEYSTROKE→PAINT LATENCY, which is what this gate was originally
 * specified as. `requestAnimationFrame` fires at the next vsync, so a
 * keydown→rAF→setTimeout(0) measurement includes a uniform 0–16.7ms wait that
 * depends on where in the refresh cycle the key landed and not at all on what
 * the keystroke cost. Measured 2026-07-29 on a deck comfortably hitting frame
 * rate, that probe reads p50 11ms and p95 17ms — meaning the originally
 * budgeted p50 < 9ms was not merely unmet, it was unreachable in principle at
 * 60Hz. The distribution is still printed here because it is the number a
 * person feels; it is not asserted, because it mostly measures vsync phase.
 *
 * Reference readings on this fixture, same day: frame gap p50 17ms, p95
 * 18–19ms, max 19–26ms, holding steady even with 4,000 extra stacking
 * contexts injected. The budgets below sit above that with room for machine
 * variance and below anything a person would call a stutter.
 *
 * The floors that keep it honest: the transcript's dot population is asserted
 * (an empty restore must not pass by having nothing to render), the keystroke
 * count is asserted (a composer that never took focus would otherwise sail
 * through with an empty distribution), and the composer's text is asserted to
 * have actually grown.
