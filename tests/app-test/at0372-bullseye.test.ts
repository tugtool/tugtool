/**
 * at0372-bullseye.test.ts — ⌃⌘B puts the focused card in a centred,
 * comfy-width reading posture, and every exit door puts it back exactly.
 *
 * **The load-bearing claim is the no-write one.** A probe that "centred the
 * pane" by calling `movePane` with a computed rect would pass every geometry
 * assertion in this file and fail only the store-record one — and it would be
 * the worse implementation by a distance, because `movePane` calls
 * `scheduleSave()` unconditionally and rewrites the `widthPreset` stamp on any
 * width change. Within one save debounce the posture is in the persisted blob
 * and the user's stamp is gone, so a crash or quit mid-bullseye strands them
 * in a stance they thought was temporary. That is the failure this test
 * exists to make impossible to ship, which is why the store read sits in the
 * middle of the geometry assertions rather than at the end as a formality.
 *
 * What the other assertions are chosen to catch:
 *
 *  1. **The frame is the imposer's one-up placement, not new centring math.**
 *     Width is asserted at exactly 800 and the frame's centre against the
 *     band's centre, computed from the container rect and the LIVE
 *     `--tug-imposer-inset-*` values rather than from a number typed here —
 *     so an implementation that centred in the canvas instead of the band
 *     (ignoring the rails) fails, which is precisely the mistake that reads
 *     as correct on a deck with no Lens open.
 *  2. **Every exit door, one case per row of the plan's table.** The two
 *     shapes fail differently and both are covered: the focus-shaped doors
 *     (a second chord, clicking another pane, clicking bare canvas) are a
 *     DERIVATION over the first responder, while the geometry-shaped doors
 *     (a width chord, the deck-wide Card Width) are explicit clears at the
 *     mutation sites. The `set-content-width` case is the one an
 *     implementation gated on call sites rather than on what changed would
 *     miss, because it bypasses `movePane` entirely.
 *  3. **Exit is pixel-identical, not approximately right.** Each door's
 *     rect is compared against the rect captured before entry, to the pixel.
 *     "Restores nothing because it disturbed nothing" is only worth claiming
 *     if it is exact.
 *  4. **An imposed pane returns to its slot.** Bullseye takes precedence
 *     over the imposition while it holds and hands the pane back to it on
 *     exit, which is the branch-ordering claim in `tug-pane.tsx`.
 *  5. **A rail is inert, and the menu says so.** The Lens cannot be
 *     bullseyed: the chord moves nothing, and `window.bullseye` reports
 *     disabled — the gate and the geometry answering the same way, from the
 *     same derived value.
 *  6. **The other content panes leave, and the rails do not.** A card that
 *     is merely dimmed is still a card you can read, so every other content
 *     pane slides off the horizontal edge it was nearest — asserted as no
 *     overlap with the canvas at all, plus the side it left by, since a pane
 *     sent out the wrong edge is equally invisible and equally wrong. The
 *     rail is asserted UNMOVED in the same breath: a rail that left would
 *     take the band's insets with it and the bullseyed card would jump the
 *     moment the posture began.
 *
 * What this fixture deliberately cannot prove:
 *
 *  - **The recede's colour.** It is a themed, transitioning value; read
 *     mid-flight it returns an interpolated `oklab(...)`. The `data-bullseye`
 *     hook is asserted instead, and the token values are the theme-contrast
 *     audit's job.
 *  - **The tween's intermediate frames.** Background app-test windows run no
 *     rAF, and an assertion hung on an animation's mid-state is banned by the
 *     harness doctrine. Every rect here is read after the settle window.
 *  - **`AppDelegate.swift`.** The Swift half — the item, its identifier, the
 *     swept key equivalent — is pinned by `at0181-keymap-chord-sweep`, the
 *     same division at0371 follows.
