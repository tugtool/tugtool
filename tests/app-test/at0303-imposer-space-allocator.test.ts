/**
 * at0303-imposer-space-allocator.test.ts — the space allocator, on the real
 * deck: each rail solved on its own, in registered greed order.
 *
 * A slot is an anchor at a fixed fraction of the band and a card's width is its
 * own, so whatever the band leaves over shows up as slack between the cards:
 * choose Five Up on a roomy deck and the cards stand apart, narrow the window
 * slightly and the same arrangement overlaps. The **space allocator** treats the
 * pinned rails' width as the flexible quantity — they are the band's other ends
 * — and solves for the total that puts every seam on one imposition gap. That
 * total is then shared out under a fixed order of invariants: floors are
 * inviolable, the tiling total outranks preferences, preferences fill in greed
 * order (the Gazette is greedier than the Lens, which is greedier than Jots),
 * and the slim content width (675) caps everything. Nothing is graded and the
 * answer is a pure function of the canvas, the chain, and the rails' policies.
 *
 * The total is chosen by the picture it PAINTS — scored on `imposeRect`'s real
 * clamped geometry, worst occlusion first — and a rail carries two floors: the
 * width it cannot paint under, and the narrower-than-comfortable width it will
 * accept when accepting it is what clears the overlap.
 *
 * What has to hold:
 *
 *  1. It engages. Picking an arrangement whose solve is inside the rail's
 *     bounds lands the rail on that solve, and every seam in the chain on
 *     `IMPOSITION_GAP_PX`. The rail's crossing is a FLIP settle like any other
 *     arrangement change, not a cut.
 *  2. It leaves the preference alone. The allocated width is live geometry; the
 *     width the user CHOSE is what the Lens reopens at, and no number of
 *     re-tunes may touch it. Read through the production path — close the Lens,
 *     open it again, and it must come back at the preferred width. This is the
 *     no-ratchet guard, and it is now structural: the solver cannot see a rail's
 *     standing width at all.
 *  3. A surplus grows the rail PAST its preference, up to the ceiling. The old
 *     rule capped an untileable slack at the width the user chose and left the
 *     deck's slack pooled between the cards instead; preference is where the
 *     fill starts, not a cap on it. Asserted explicitly so the deleted cap
 *     cannot creep back.
 *  4. Re-asserting the layout re-tunes. Re-clicking the already-active Cards
 *     option used to be a total no-op; it now drives the same entry the
 *     settled-resize observer calls. The harness cannot resize the app's
 *     window, so this gesture is what covers that entry end to end.
 *  5. Joining the chain RE-TUNES. Assigning a card to a slot is the imposer's
 *     own verb — the user asked the deck to arrange itself, whichever door
 *     dispatched it — so the assign itself re-solves the rails for the chain
 *     it just completed, with no separate Layouts click needed.
 *  6. Two rails answer with two widths, in greed order. With the Gazette on one
 *     edge and the Lens on the other, the two rails stand at DIFFERENT widths,
 *     and which one is wide is the registered greed order's answer: shrink what
 *     the chain leaves and the Lens drains to its floor while the Gazette holds
 *     its measure.
 *  7. A crowded deck spends comfort to un-occlude the cards. When the chain
 *     overlaps at the rails' comfort floors but tiles below them, the Gazette
 *     gives up its comfortable measure and the chain stands clear — showing
 *     the user's cards outranks a rail's preferred measure. Asserted on real
 *     pane rects: no two chain panes overlap, and the Gazette is narrower than
 *     its comfort width while never under its hard floor.
 *  8. The hard floor is the DRAG floor, and it is genuinely reachable. A real
 *     edge drag can take the Gazette below its comfort measure, down to the
 *     width it cannot paint under and no further. The rail's comfort measure
 *     constrains the ALLOCATOR; it may not trap the user's own hand.
 *
 * **THE HARNESS CANNOT RESIZE THE WINDOW**, which is why every fixture card
 * width is computed at runtime from the measured canvas: `T*` is
 * `canvas − gap·(R+2) − B*` and `B*` is a function of the chain's card widths,
 * so moving a fixture card's width moves the target exactly as moving the
 * canvas would. Seeding card widths and re-asserting the layout is how this
 * test reaches either side of a breakpoint. Preferences are seeded through
 * tugbank rather than assumed.
