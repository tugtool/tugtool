/**
 * at0370-gazette-follow-bottom.test.ts — the Gazette follows its live edge,
 * and says so.
 *
 * Two claims, and they are one mechanism seen from both sides.
 *
 * **Following.** While the reader is at the live edge, an arriving post keeps
 * them there — including the in-flight Operator wave, which is a row like any
 * other and pushes the edge down exactly as a post does. While the reader is
 * up in history, an arriving post must NOT yank them down; the line under the
 * eye is theirs until they ask for the bottom back.
 *
 * **Saying so.** The shared `TugJumpToBottomButton` floats over the column
 * whenever the reader is away from the edge, and clicking it jumps back and
 * re-engages following. Visibility is a `data-visible` attribute the card
 * writes ([L06]) — never React state — so the observable here is that
 * attribute on the real button, driven through the card's own follow-state
 * writer.
 *
 * **Resizing.** Follow-state is a reading of geometry, not a memory of a
 * gesture, so a change to the geometry re-reads it. A rail animating from
 * Stack to Split, a pane drag, the composer growing under the user's typing —
 * each moves the live edge with no scroll event to announce it, and one that
 * brings the edge back under the eye must re-engage. The composer drives that
 * here, and the reader is parked at exactly the distance where `scrollTop`
 * stays valid across the resize, so the browser clamps nothing and fires
 * nothing: the only thing that can re-engage following is the resize itself.
 *
 * Real geometry throughout: real posts through the production publish path,
 * real rendered markdown at real measured heights, real typing in the real
 * field, and the button clicked where it actually paints.
