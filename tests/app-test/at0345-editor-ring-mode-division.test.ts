/**
 * at0345-editor-ring-mode-division.test.ts — an editor rings iff it is a
 * **parked** stop; a caret-holding editor never does.
 *
 * ## Why this exists, and why it inverted
 *
 * This file used to assert the flat rule "a text editor never wears a focus
 * ring", on the reasoning that the blinking caret is a complete carrier of
 * keyboard focus and a ring beside it is an illegal redundancy. That rule was
 * right about the state it could see and wrong as an axiom, and KBF mode
 * ([roadmap/kbf-mode.md]) traces it as the root of the whole compensation
 * network the mode deletes: with no parked state available, "an editor always
 * has the caret" forced every arrow that reached an editor to either grant it
 * or be pushed back out, which is what the boundary latch, the empty-input
 * release, and the Tab-when-empty handoff all existed to arrange.
 *
 * The mode restores the parked stop, so the rule is now a division rather than
 * an absolute:
 *
 *   - **Mode OFF** — an editor holding the caret wears no ring, exactly as
 *     before. Cases 1–3 below are the original assertions, unchanged, and they
 *     are the half of the old rule that was always true.
 *   - **Mode ON, arrived at by MOVEMENT** — the stop is PARKED: it rings, and
 *     the editor does *not* hold the caret. Case 4 is the old case 4 inverted;
 *     it asserted precisely the state the mode reintroduces.
 *   - **Typing grants.** A printable character at a parked stop clears the mode,
 *     grants the caret, and lands the character — case 5, the transition that
 *     makes the parked state usable rather than a dead end.
 *
 * The seed rule's half (a text-first sheet opens ringed AND with a caret) lives
 * in the parked-stop suite, which can open a sheet; this file stays on the
 * session card.
