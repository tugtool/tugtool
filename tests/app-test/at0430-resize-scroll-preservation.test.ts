/**
 * at0430-resize-scroll-preservation.test.ts — changing a card's width never
 * moves what the reader is looking at.
 *
 * The scroller survives a width change intact, and that is the whole problem:
 * `scrollTop` is faithfully preserved while the content it names re-wraps out
 * from under it. WebKit implements no CSS scroll anchoring, so before the
 * resize episode a bullseye toggle on a scrolled-up transcript left the reader
 * somewhere else in the document with nothing in the DOM to show for it.
 *
 * The invariant asserted here is the top edge: whatever row was at the
 * scroller's top edge is at the same offset from the top edge afterwards. Not
 * `scrollTop` — `scrollTop` is *expected* to move, and the diagnostics note how
 * far, because a case where it did not move proves nothing about anchoring.
 *
 * What each assertion is chosen to catch:
 *
 *  1. **The episode actually ran.** A `MutationObserver` on the frame's
 *     `data-resize-episode` stamp records every episode raised during the run,
 *     and each gesture is asserted to have raised one. Without it a card whose
 *     content happens not to reflow at that width passes every position
 *     assertion while the mechanism is dead, which is the exact shape of the
 *     bug this feature exists to fix.
 *  2. **Every raise site, not one.** The width chords and bullseye come in
 *     through the FLIP settle; the west-edge drag comes in at pointer-down and
 *     lives across a gesture the settle never sees; the deck-wide Card Width
 *     bypasses `movePane` entirely. Three doors, three different lifetimes.
 *  3. **Follow-bottom is not an anchor.** A transcript pinned to the bottom
 *     must still be pinned after the width change — an implementation that
 *     captured a top-edge anchor unconditionally would freeze it mid-document
 *     and quietly break the live-tail case, which is the state most transcripts
 *     spend most of their life in.
 *  4. **The displacement tripwire.** `data-scroll-displacements` counts
 *     `scrollTop` moves the list view could not account for. The episode writes
 *     `scrollTop` deliberately and repeatedly; if those writes are not
 *     attributed through SmartScroll the counter climbs, follow-bottom starts
 *     mistaking the machine's own corrections for the user scrolling, and the
 *     damage shows up far from here. Read before and after, asserted equal.
 *  5. **The generic fallback on a plain-flow card.** A card that never took
 *     over its own scrolling owns no anchor semantics and never claims the
 *     episode, so it is held by the module's own element anchor in the PANE's
 *     content box — a different code path from the transcript's resolver, and
 *     the one every future card inherits by default.
 *  6. **The document substrate, in its own unit.** A CodeMirror view claims
 *     the episode and holds the character under the top edge. Its assertion is
 *     WHICH LINE stands at the top rather than a pixel, because soft wrap
 *     means holding the top edge is exactly what makes the text beneath it
 *     move.
 *  7. **The PDF, where an element anchor is the wrong answer.** Its layout is
 *     derived from a scale that IS the card's width, so a page's top edge is
 *     not a fixed point. The assertion is the page and the fraction of the way
 *     down it — the two quantities a re-scale leaves alone.
 *
 * What this fixture deliberately does not prove:
 *
 *  - **Intermediate tween frames.** Background app-test windows run no rAF and
 *     an assertion hung on mid-flight motion is banned by the harness doctrine.
 *     Every measurement here is taken after the episode's stamp has cleared.
 *  - **`TugMarkdownView`.** It ships in the gallery only, and it claims
 *     nothing: the episode's own anchor descends past its aria-hidden spacers
 *     to the block under the top edge, which is the anchor a bespoke handler
 *     would have computed. The descent itself is pinned by the transcript and
 *     plain-flow cases here.
 *  - **A drag's resulting geometry.** The drag applies its width from a rAF
 *     loop, and a background app-test window suspends rAF, so the pane cannot
 *     actually move here. That door asserts its raise instead.
