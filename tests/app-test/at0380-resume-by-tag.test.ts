/**
 * at0380-resume-by-tag.test.ts — the callsign is addressable ([P12]).
 *
 * ## What this gates
 *
 * `/resume <callsign>` resolves a name to a session and drives the same
 * `fireRestore` the picker's Open drives. Two of its three pieces can only be
 * seen in the running app:
 *
 *   A. **The route reads its argument, and the reverse index answers.** The
 *      card's `resume` surface used to ignore `args` and open the picker
 *      regardless — close enough to working that it would survive review. With
 *      an argument it must resolve instead, and the proof that it resolved is
 *      that it reports the *specific* outcome for that session rather than the
 *      generic "no such callsign".
 *
 *   B. **An unresolvable callsign is answered.** A typed command that does
 *      nothing at all reads as the app being broken, so the miss has a surface:
 *      a caution bulletin naming the callsign.
 *
 * Both go through `run-card-command`, which is the production door a menu item
 * carrying a name and args uses and which the module's own comment describes as
 * byte-identical to typing the command. It is used here rather than typing into
 * the composer because a background app-test cannot make the CM6 editor the
 * chain leaf, so Return never reaches the entry's submit — the same limitation
 * that keeps the ⌘S editor-leaf assertions at the store layer. The third piece,
 * the matcher accepting the argument at all (`takesArgs`), is exactly a pure
 * string rule and is unit-tested in `slash-commands.test.ts`.
