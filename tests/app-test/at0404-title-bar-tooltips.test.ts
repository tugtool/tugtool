/**
 * at0404-title-bar-tooltips.test.ts — every control at the trailing end of a
 * title bar says what it does before you press it.
 *
 * The cluster is a row of icons and a count: a stack badge, a bullseye target,
 * the active card's own verbs (a Text card contributes Reveal in Finder and
 * Card Settings…), a width control, and the close box. All but the count are
 * glyphs with no text anywhere near them, and the count is a bare number. Read
 * cold, none of them is self-evident — so each carries a tooltip, and two of
 * them carry the chord that does the same thing without the mouse.
 *
 * What is worth proving here:
 *
 *   1. Each control opens a bubble, and the bubble names an ACT. The phrase is
 *      the thing the press will do ("Center this card in bullseye"), not a
 *      restatement of the glyph ("Bullseye") — the glyph is already on screen
 *      and repeating it in prose tells the reader nothing they did not have.
 *
 *   2. The chord chip is READ, never authored. Bullseye and close both
 *      duplicate a keyboard shortcut, so both are `TugActionTooltip`s whose
 *      chip comes from the keymap registry through `commandShortcut`. The
 *      proof that it is read is a REBIND: the test writes an override the way
 *      any other process would, through the defaults path, and the chip says
 *      the new chord on its next hover with no reload. An authored "⌃⌘B"
 *      would pass every assertion above this one and fail this one. The width
 *      control gets NO chip: its chords are ⌃⌘1/2/3, one per preset, and the
 *      trigger is none of them.
 *
 *   3. The phrase turns with the state it describes. In bullseye the button
 *      offers the way out; the width control names the width it is currently
 *      holding. A tooltip that read the same in both postures would be the
 *      resting lie the `aria-label` already avoids.
 *
 *   4. The composition survives. Two of these controls are popup-menu
 *      triggers and a third runs its own pointer-capture close protocol,
 *      so none of them can be a Radix tooltip trigger directly — the bubble
 *      anchors a span around each. The proof that the wrapper is inert is that
 *      the controls still work: this test opens the width menu through the
 *      same span it just hovered. (Option-click close, the gesture the direct
 *      composition broke, is held by at0040.)
 *
 * Hover is synthesized the way at0334 does it — a `pointerenter` plus a
 * `pointermove` on the trigger — because a background app-test window runs no
 * rAF and nothing here may hang off an animation completing. The bubble is
 * portaled to the canvas overlay, so it is found globally rather than under
 * the pane.
