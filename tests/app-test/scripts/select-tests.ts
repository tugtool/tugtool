/**
 * select-tests.ts — resolve changed source paths to the app-test files that cover them.
 *
 * Every `*.test.ts` under `tests/app-test/` declares the source it exercises with `@covers`
 * lines in its header docblock:
 *
 *     /**
 *      * at0240-lens-focus-grammar.test.ts — ...prose...
 *      *
 *      * @covers tugdeck/src/components/lens/
 *      * @covers tugdeck/src/lib/lens-store/
 *      *\/
 *
 * A `@covers` value is either a repo-relative path prefix (a trailing `/` means the whole
 * subtree) or a glob. A changed file selects a test when it matches any of that test's
 * `@covers` values.
 *
 * A test that takes the screen also declares that, with `@foreground` on its own docblock
 * line. The `app-test` recipe reads the declaration before it launches anything, so it can
 * tell the developer that a run is about to seize the machine.
 *
 * There are two ways a test takes the screen, and the check knows both. The declared one is
 * the `foreground` launch option, which puts the app in the activating event mode. The other
 * is calling an app-lifecycle RPC verb: those drive `NSApp.activate` and a Finder activation
 * inside the app, whatever mode it launched in, so a background launch does not make them
 * background. Reading only the launch option missed that second class entirely.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/select-tests.ts                  # derive changed paths from git
 *   bun scripts/select-tests.ts <path>...        # explicit changed paths
 *   bun scripts/select-tests.ts --print          # print the selection, run nothing
 *   bun scripts/select-tests.ts --check          # lint: @covers present, resolving, and scoped
 *   bun scripts/select-tests.ts --core           # the core tier's file list
 *   bun scripts/select-tests.ts --foreground <f>...   # the @foreground subset of <f>...
 *   bun scripts/select-tests.ts --foreground-check    # lint: @foreground matches behavior
 *
 * Selected test filenames go to stdout, one per line (feed straight to `just app-test`).
 * Reasons, advisories, and diagnostics go to stderr.
 *
 * ## The selection budget
 *
 * A derived selection is only useful if it stays small. Past MAX_SELECTED files the run
 * stops being "the tests for my change" and becomes a sweep in disguise — twenty minutes
 * of serialized Tug.app launches nobody asked for. So the budget is a REFUSAL, and it is
 * final: over it, this script emits no filenames and exits EXIT_OVER_BUDGET.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO opt-in flag. A budget with an override is not a budget — the
 * override becomes the habit, and every over-budget run gets waved through with a reason
 * that felt good at the time. Narrow the diff, or name the handful of tests you actually
 * mean. MAX_SELECTED is the limit.
 *
 * `--check` enforces the same ceiling ahead of time: no single source path may fan out to
 * more than MAX_SELECTED tests. Today's hub files already exceed it and are recorded in
 * ACCEPTED_FANOUT as known debt — the lint holds that line so the fan-out can shrink but
 * never grow, and a NEW hub fails the check on the commit that creates it.

 * actually asks, and it costs a minute rather than twenty.
 *
 * This list is deliberately tiny and stays that way. An ordinary component — even a
 * heavily-used one like the session card, the transcript, or the text editor — does NOT
 * belong here: those are covered by name, they change constantly, and flagging them
 * turned the advisory into noise that fired on every substantial diff. If a component's
