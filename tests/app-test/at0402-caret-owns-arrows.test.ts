/**
 * at0402-caret-owns-arrows.test.ts — a granted caret keeps its caret keys while
 * KBF is engaged, and the plane takes them back the moment the stop parks.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The mode's paint answers to the keyboard ROUTE ({@link FocusManager.kbfPainting}):
 * engaged with a caret granted, the rings stand down and the doctrine says the
 * keyboard belongs to the text surface. The MOVEMENT stages did not get that
 * memo — they gated on `kbfEngaged()` — so wherever a surface declared a spatial
 * order the engine kept steering through the caret. Measured on the question
 * dialog's free-text answer field, which is a trapped (Class A) surface and so
 * is engaged from the moment it opens:
 *
 * | after            | key view      | ring          | activeElement    |
 * |------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
 * | typing           | message editor| none          | `cm-content`     |
 * | ArrowDown        | push button   | push button   | `tug-key-sink`   |
 * | ArrowUp          | message editor| message editor| `tug-key-sink`  |
 *
 * A user mid-sentence pressed ↓ and lost the caret; ↑ brought the ring back to
 * the field but PARKED, so they still could not type. Nothing painted at the
 * moment of the theft, which is exactly what kept it invisible for a phase.
 *
 * The rule is [P07]'s structural split applied to the arrow plane: horizontal
 * arrows belong to any caret, vertical arrows belong to a multi-line surface.
 * The discriminating half of this suite is the second act — Tab PARKS the field,
 * and then the very same ↓ moves the ring, which is what proves the fix is a
 * caret rule and not a blanket "arrows never move in a dialog".
