/**
 * dash-fixture.ts — creating, rounding, and releasing a real dash from an
 * app-test, by the real CLI.
 *
 * Shared because the alternative is four copies, and because the one thing
 * that is genuinely hard here has to be got right in all of them: **these
 * fixtures drive the developer's own repository, which other processes are
 * holding at the same time.** Every live tugcast instance — the release app,
 * every other app-test instance — runs a base-motion engine that shells git
 * against this repo, so a `tugutil dash create` here can lose a coin toss for
 * `index.lock`. The lock is transient by construction, so every git-touching
 * verb retries through it rather than failing the file that lost.
 *
 * A failure that is *not* transient fails immediately and carries the whole
 * corpse — exit code, signal, both streams. The alternative is what actually
 * happened: `tugutil dash create … failed:` with nothing after the colon,
 * because the message quoted only stderr and the process died before writing
 * any.
 *
 * Everything else about a dash fixture is deliberately unclever: the dash is
 * real, the round is a real commit, and the release really discards the branch
 * and the worktree.
