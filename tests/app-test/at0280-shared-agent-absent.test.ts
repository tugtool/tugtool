/**
 * at0280-shared-agent-absent.test.ts — what the app looks like with no agent.
 *
 * Shell arbitration and PULSE intent summaries are strict enhancement: with the
 * `SharedAgent` unavailable, nothing about the app changes. That claim is easy
 * to state and easy to break, because both tenants live on surfaces people touch
 * constantly — the PULSE strip and the prompt composer. This pins the agentless
 * posture so a regression shows up as a failing test rather than as a stray line
 * or a chip nobody asked for.
 *
 * **The forcing mechanism is the app-test gate itself ([P08]).** The pool
 * refuses to spawn a worker when `TUGAPP_APP_TEST=1` is in the environment, and
 * the harness launches every instance with it — the variable reaches tugcast
 * because `ProcessManager.swift` seeds the tugcast child's environment from the
 * app's own. So the agentless posture is what every app-test instance has, on
 * every machine, with nothing to seed. Deliberately **no tugbank kill switches
 * are written here**: seeding them would let this test pass for a reason other
 * than the one it claims, and it would stop testing the gate.
 *
 * **The positive path cannot be covered here, by design.** No app-test may spend
 * subscription tokens, so no app-test can ever see a real verdict or a real
 * headline. That path is covered by the on-demand real-claude worker test and by
 * the Rust fake-spawner suites (`shared_agent.rs`, `feeds/shell.rs`,
 * `feeds/session_overview.rs`); the submit-time routing logic is covered as pure
 * logic in `shell-line-classifier.test.ts` and the deck's parking and
 * correlation in `shell-classify-store.test.ts`.
 *
 * Three claims:
 *   1. The masthead renders its activity run, and there is no headline run at
 *      all — nor any `PULSE` ink standing in for one. With no agent no goal is
 *      ever composed, and the reading for that is now an absence rather than a
 *      placeholder word: the standing-goal level left chrome, so a session with
 *      nothing composed for it simply has two lines that say true things and no
 *      third that says a word. Never an invented goal, and never a line that
 *      quietly fabricates one from the activity beside it.
 *   2. Typing lines that open with a PATH executable — `make test`, `git
 *      status` — leaves the composer holding plain text: no routing chip, no
 *      atom of any kind. Routing is a submit-time decision over the whole
 *      line, so nothing may materialize in the document while the user types.
 *   3. The Lens's row for the same session shows no goal line either. The
 *      card's strip and the Lens row read the same overview through two
 *      separate call sites, so absence has to be pinned on both.
 *
 * **Typing only — this test never submits a turn.** A real send into a
 * replay-backed harness session is out of bounds.
 *
 * Foreground: ⌘A is an Edit-menu key equivalent, so AppKit resolves it
 * against the main menu before the web view sees a keydown. A background
 * instance has no key window for that resolution to land in, and the
 * select-all that clears the editor never happens.
