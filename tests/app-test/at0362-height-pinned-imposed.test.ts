/**
 * at0362-height-pinned-imposed.test.ts — a size-locked card is PLACED by the
 * imposition, not SIZED by it.
 *
 * An imposed pane normally IS its slot: `imposeStyle` runs it the whole
 * vertical band and pins it by its own width, because for every card that
 * holds content the box the arrangement gives out and the box the card fills
 * are the same box. About breaks that. It is a fixed 320×360 card — `min ==
 * max == preferred` in its registration, which is how a card type says
 * "exactly one correct size" — so it has no larger form to be stretched into.
 *
 * Two things follow, and they are the same rule read on two axes. Vertically,
 * stretching it to the height of a display leaves an about box with six
 * hundred pixels of nothing under the copyright line. Horizontally, pinning it
 * by its own 320 puts it hard against the band's near edge in slot 0 — a
 * narrow pane has more travel to give away, so it lands somewhere no other
 * card in that arrangement would. Both are the imposition treating the card's
 * size as the slot's size.
 *
 * So the slot is computed as though an ordinary content card stood there — the
 * deck's content-width preset wide, the full run tall — and About is centred
 * inside it. The slot belongs to the arrangement; the card is a thing standing
 * in it.
 *
 * What makes this worth a test rather than a glance is that nothing about the
 * About card asks for it. The opt-in is derived from the size policy already in
 * the registry (`min === max` per axis), so the failure mode is silent: a
 * refactor that drops the derivation leaves a card that still opens, still
 * lands in its slot, and is simply in the wrong place at the wrong size.
 * Geometry is the assertion.
 *
 * The neighbour in the seeded deck is the control. It is an ordinary content
 * card in the same three-up, and it must still fill its slot — proving the
 * change is a branch taken on the policy rather than a new rule for every
 * imposed pane.
 *
 * Scenario:
 *   1. Seed a three-up deck: an ordinary card in slot 0, About in slot 2.
 *   2. The ordinary card runs from the top gap to the bottom gap.
 *   3. About holds 320×360, and its centre sits on the centre of the slot an
 *      800-wide content card would have occupied.
 *   4. Clearing the imposition freezes About where it stood — the freeze reads
 *      the live frame, so the centred rect is what it keeps.
