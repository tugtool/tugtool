/**
 * at0388-press-collapses-selection.test.ts — pressing inside a
 * selection collapses it on the way DOWN, not on the way up.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * WebKit and CM6 both defer collapsing a selection when the press
 * lands inside it, so that press can begin a drag of the selected
 * text. The cost is a wash: the range stays painted for as long as
 * the button is held, and after a Select All "inside the selection"
 * is everywhere — so an ordinary click anywhere in an editor lit the
 * WHOLE document until release. Reported as a flash; it is the
 * deferral, made maximally visible by ⌘A.
 *
 * The test reproduces that mechanism: select a line, then press
 * inside the selection and read what is selected WHILE THE BUTTON IS
 * STILL DOWN — the release is what used to hide the bug. The read is
 * `window.getSelection().toString()`: what the user has actually got
 * selected and therefore what is painted, not an internal range the
 * surface reports about itself.
 *
 * The line is selected by pressing its gutter number (at0386's
 * gesture) rather than by ⌘A or a sweep across the text: the
 * deferral is the same whatever made the range, and the gutter press
 * is a selection primitive that stands up in a headless run without
 * the responder chain or CM6's own drag-select. ⌘A is merely the
 * case that makes the wash span the whole document.
 *
 * The pre-assertion — the line really is selected before the press —
 * keeps the post-assertion from passing vacuously.
