/**
 * at0294-imposer-flip-settle.test.ts — the imposer settles by FLIP, and leaves
 * nothing behind.
 *
 * An arrangement change moves every derived frame at once. The motion is no
 * longer a transition on `left`/`top`/`width` — that re-runs layout for every
 * moving frame on every frame of the motion — but FLIP: the new geometry is
 * committed in one layout pass and each moved frame is tweened by a transform
 * that starts at the inverse of the move and ends at nothing
 * (`deck-canvas.tsx`, `lib/pane-flip.ts`).
 *
 * Three things have to hold, and the third is the one with teeth.
 *
 * The transform tween must be transform-only, or it is not the cheap kind: a
 * keyframe touching a layout property puts the effect back on the main thread
 * and the whole point is lost
 * (`roadmap/jul30-perf-brief.md#i1-sparkline-exception`). A width change past
 * the smear cap rides a SECOND effect of its own — real `width` keyframes,
 * main-thread by design ([D135]) — and the two must never merge.
 *
 * The frames must land where the imposer says, which is hand-computable from
 * `imposeRect`'s rule: the band is the span inset by a gap at each end, and a
 * slot sits `slot / (count - 1)` of the way along whatever the band has left
 * over after the pane's own width.
 *
 * And no frame may keep an inline `transform` afterwards. TugAnimator commits
 * an animation's final value into `el.style` when it completes — whatever
 * `fill` says — and React never clears it, because `transform` is not a key
 * TugPane renders. A frame wearing any transform is a containing block for its
 * `position: fixed` descendants, and TugSheet portals into the frame while
 * completion popups, alerts, and banners all position from viewport
 * coordinates. The residue would offset all of them by the pane's origin, and
 * only after the FIRST arrangement change — so this test asserts the inline
 * style directly (the computed value of an untransformed element is `none`,
 * which would pass vacuously), asserts it again after a SECOND settle, and
 * then measures the consequence: a fixed-position probe planted inside a frame
 * must resolve against the viewport, not against the pane.
 *
 * A slot assignment carries a fourth rule. It raises the card it slots, and
 * the raise is a precondition of the motion rather than its epilogue — a frame
 * that rose only at the end would spend the whole crossing underneath the
 * panes it is on its way to sitting in front of. The converse is asserted too:
 * z-order moves nothing, so a bare raise must arm no settle window.
 *
 * Scenario:
 *   1. Seed a two-up deck with a pinned Lens on the right.
 *   2. Flip the Lens to the left. Mid-window: the container wears
 *      `data-imposer-settling` and every animation on a frame is transform-only.
 *   3. After land: no animations, no attribute, no inline transform, and the
 *      frames sit where `imposeRect` says.
 *   4. Flip back. Assert the no-residue rule a second time, then plant the
 *      fixed-position probe.
 *   5. A slot assignment: the frame is already on top when its tween starts,
 *      and a bare pane raise arms no window at all.
 *   6. The deck's content width: the frames scale to their new boxes on the
 *      same spring, still transform-only, and keep neither the transform nor
 *      the origin it was anchored by.
 *   7. Retarget: a second change dispatched inside the first one's window.
 *      Tweens are replaced, not stacked, and the final geometry is still right.
 *
 * A width change reaches the settle at all only because the deck makes one of
 * them in ONE state change — `setContentWidth` resizes every content pane,
 * restamps the record, and re-solves the rails together. FLIP measures across a
 * single commit; a notify per pane would hand it a half-changed deck each time.
 * `deck-manager.ts` is deliberately NOT a `@covers` line here: it is at its
 * fan-out budget, and the width applier's own contract is `at0357`'s.
