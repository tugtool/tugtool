# `tests/app-test/`

Procedural reference for test authors working in `tests/app-test/`.

## Running

```bash
# 1. One-time per machine: verify the Developer ID Application cert
#    is installed (via Xcode → Settings → Accounts → Manage Certificates).
just setup-dev-signing

# 2. Build (and re-sign) Tug.app + Rust binaries + tugdeck dist.
#    Re-run only when Swift / Rust sources change.
just build-app

# 3. Run the tests that cover what you changed. This is the everyday command.
just app-test-changed

# The ~20-test core tier — one test per load-bearing surface:
just app-test

# Run a single file:
just app-test at0001-tab-switch-fc.test.ts
just app-test harness-smoke/smoke.test.ts

# Run a list of specific files in order:
just app-test harness-smoke/smoke.test.ts at0003-pane-activation.test.ts

# Every test file. Slow — one Tug.app launch per file.
just app-test-all
```

### Choosing what to run

Running everything is almost never the right move: each file launches its own `Tug.app` subprocess, and the whole suite is serialized behind a machine-wide gate. Selection is derived, not guessed — every test declares the source it exercises in its header docblock:

```ts
/**
 * at0240-lens-focus-grammar.test.ts — ...prose...
 *
 * @covers tugdeck/src/components/lens/
 * @covers tugdeck/src/lib/lens-store/
 */
```

A `@covers` value is a repo-relative path (a trailing `/` means the whole subtree) or a glob. `just app-test-changed` reads the changed files out of `git status`, resolves them through those declarations, prints which changed file pulled in each test, and runs exactly that set. Prefer **generous** globs — a directory over a single file — so a rename inside the subsystem doesn't silently drop coverage.

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `just app-test-changed [paths…]` | The tests whose `@covers` match your working diff (or the given paths) |
| `just app-test-select [paths…]` | Same selection, printed but not run |
| `just app-test` | The ~20-test core tier (defined in the `app-test` recipe) |
| `just app-test <files…>` | Exactly the named files |
| `just app-test-all` | Every test file |
| `just app-test-covers-check` | Lint: every test declares `@covers`, and every path resolves |
| `just app-test-foreground-check` | Lint: `@foreground` matches which tests actually take the screen |

A few paths `@covers` cannot scope, because they run before any test's first assertion: `tests/app-test/_harness/`, `tugapp/Sources/TestHarness/`, `tugdeck/src/main.tsx`, `tugdeck/index.html`. The selector prints a **CORE TIER ADVISED** advisory when it sees one changed, and the answer is `just app-test` — the ~20-file core tier, which is what "did I break everything?" actually asks. The list is deliberately tiny: ordinary components, however widely used, are covered by name and do not trip it.

### `@foreground` — the tests that take over the screen

App-tests run in the **background**. The app launches as an accessory, keyboard events go to its process and mouse events straight into its window, and you keep working while a run happens around you.

A minority cannot work that way, because activation *is* their subject: app resign / become-active cycles, key-window-gated responder routing, `document.hasFocus()`. Those launch with `foreground: true`, which puts the app back in the activating event mode — and they really do take the screen out from under you. Each one declares itself with `@foreground` on its own docblock line, beside `@covers`:

```ts
/**
 * at0145-permission-dialog-keyboard.test.ts — …
 *
 * @foreground
 * @covers tugdeck/src/components/tugways/chrome/session-permission-dialog.tsx
 */
```

When a run contains any of them, `just app-test` raises the question in the Session card straight away — and then **gets on with the background tests while you decide.** The screen-takers are ordered last, so by the time the answer matters it is usually already in. Nothing that needed no permission ever waits on something that did. Declining skips them; the background run happened either way, and every skipped file shows as a `SKIP` row in the summary.

`TUG_APPTEST_ASSUME=all|background|cancel` answers ahead of time; scripted and non-interactive runs should set it. With no Tug instance to ask, a run proceeds after naming the tests that will take the screen — blocking a terminal-only run that could never have shown a dialog is worse than an unannounced one you started by hand.

`just app-test-foreground-check` holds the declaration honest in both directions. A foreground launch with no tag would seize the screen unannounced, which is the real harm; a tag with no such launch would prompt about a test that was never disruptive.

The check reads the launch option statically, so anything that is not literally `foreground: false` counts as a screen-taker. A computed flag (`foreground: SOAK_SECS === 0`) cannot be resolved by reading the file, and the safe reading of "it might take the screen" is to declare it.

`just app-test` ends every run with a structured summary block whose
last stdout line is exactly `VERDICT: PASS  (...)` or `VERDICT: FAIL
(...)`. Recipe exit code matches the verdict — 0 iff PASS. To check
pass/fail programmatically:

```bash
just app-test 2>/dev/null | tail -n 1   # → VERDICT: PASS  (47/47 ...)
```

The summary also lists every file with `[PASS]` / `[FAIL]` / `[SKIP]`
/ `[ERR]` and per-file `(passed/total)` counts, plus a `Failures:`
block when any file fails. See
[`roadmap/tugplan-app-test-cleanup.md#s01-summary-format`](../../roadmap/tugplan-app-test-cleanup.md#s01-summary-format)
for the contract.

### Concurrency: one invocation at a time

Whole `just app-test` invocations are serialized machine-wide by a
port gate (`tugutil host gate run --name apptest`): native CGEvent input
and app activation are login-session singletons, so only one run may
drive them at a time. Invoking `just app-test` while another worktree
(or another terminal) holds the gate prints

```
gate 'apptest' held by <worktree-slug> (pid <pid>, since <iso8601>) — waiting…
```

and queues until the holder finishes — nothing is killed, both runs
complete. The wait is event-driven (the gate releases the moment the
holder exits, even on SIGKILL). For scripted callers that prefer
fail-fast over queueing:

```bash
tugrust/target/debug/tugutil gate run --name apptest --no-wait -- true
# exit 2 + holder info when held (JSON shape with --json)
```

Each worktree's run is otherwise fully isolated: its own
`Tug-apptest.app` bundle (per-worktree DerivedData, same bundle id —
the one AX grant covers all of them), and `apptest-<wtslug>-<uuid>`
instance ids whose cleanup sweeps match only that worktree's prefix.

## Environment variables

| Variable                  | Purpose                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TUGAPP_APP_TEST=1`    | Enables the `describe.skipIf(!SHOULD_RUN)` gate. Set by the just-recipe; tests should never set it themselves. |
| `TUGAPP_DEBUG_PATH`       | Absolute path to the debug `Tug.app` binary. Set by the just-recipe via xcodebuild's settings query. |
| `TUGAPP_TUGCODE_BINARY`   | Absolute path to the bun-compiled `tugcode` binary. Used by EM-card / live-mode tests. |
| `TUGAPP_TUGBANK_BINARY`   | Absolute path to the `tugbank` CLI. Used by cold-boot disk-side reads in `_harness/tugbank-helpers.ts`. |
| `TUGAPP_TEST_SOCKET`      | Reserved; set by the harness when spawning the subprocess.   |
| `TUGCODE_LIVE=1`          | Opt-in for live-mode tugcode smoke (`harness-smoke/smoke-em-live.test.ts`); requires Anthropic credentials. Skipped by default. |
| `APP_TEST_SKIP_RESIGN=1`  | Bypass the defensive re-sign in `just app-test`. Tests that need `CGEvent.post` will fail; tests that don't will pass. Diagnostic-only — see `tuglaws/code-signing-mac.md`. |

Per-run log files are written under `tests/app-test/logs/` when a
test passes `testName` to `launchTugApp`; the directory is gitignored.

## Live-mode tugcode smoke

`tests/app-test/harness-smoke/smoke-em-live.test.ts` exercises a real
tugcode → Claude Code → Anthropic API round-trip. Because it consumes
API credits and requires live credentials, it is double-gated behind
`TUGCODE_LIVE=1` and stays out of the default `just app-test` sweep.

```bash
# Anthropic credentials must already be set (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or
# `claude login`'s persisted creds).
TUGCODE_LIVE=1 just app-test harness-smoke/smoke-em-live.test.ts
```

The test sends a single deterministic prompt ("Reply with the single
word: ack.") so token cost stays in single digits per run. First-token
latency is allowed up to 20s for cold-start claude; full-turn up to
60s. Failure surfaces the last 50 lines of tugcode's stdout/stderr to
stderr.

## Selectors that mirror the product

Product strings and ids a test queries — an `aria-label`, a dialog island class,
a focus-engine mark — live in [`_harness/selectors.ts`](_harness/selectors.ts),
not inline in each test. A rename in the product otherwise goes undetected:
`querySelector` keeps parsing and keeps returning `null`, so the failure reads
as a behavior regression in whatever the test was actually checking. Renaming
one `aria-label` broke seven files that way.

`selectors.ts` also carries `keyboardIsInCard(cardId)`, the engine-fact form of
"the keyboard is here." Under the focus engine, `document.activeElement` parks
on the key sink **outside** every card whenever the route is `engine-routed`, so
card containment of the active element is not a test for keyboard location — it
is a test for a `dom-granted` text surface specifically. Assert engine facts
(`getFocusedCardId()`, `[data-key-view]`, `[data-first-responder]`); reach for
`document.activeElement` only where a grant is the thing under test, and say so
in a comment.

## Adding a new test

Canonical test shape:

```ts
import { describe, expect, test } from "bun:test";
import { launchTugApp } from "@/_harness";

const SHOULD_RUN = process.env.TUGAPP_APP_TEST === "1";

describe.skipIf(!SHOULD_RUN)("my scenario", () => {
  test("does the thing", async () => {
    const app = await launchTugApp({ testName: "my-scenario" });
    try {
      await app.seedDeckState({ /* ... */ });
      await app.click({ selector: "[data-card-id='a']" });
      const focused = await app.getFocused();
      expect(focused?.cardId).toBe("a");
    } finally {
      await app.close();
    }
  });
});
```

Step-by-step:

1. **Decide: smoke or scenario?** See
   [`tuglaws/app-test-harness.md`](../../tuglaws/app-test-harness.md)
   for the classification rule. If you're adding a scenario, also add
   the inventory entry in
   [`tuglaws/app-test-inventory.md`](../../tuglaws/app-test-inventory.md)
   first — pick the next unused `AT{NNNN}` (high-water mark and "next
   available" are both at the top of the inventory).

2. **Name the file.**
   - Scenario: `tests/app-test/at{NNNN}-<slug>.test.ts`.
   - Smoke: `tests/app-test/harness-smoke/<descriptive>.test.ts`.

3. **Declare `@covers` in the header docblock.** One line per source path
   or glob the test exercises, at the end of the docblock. Without it the
   test can never be selected by `just app-test-changed` — it silently
   stops guarding its surface, which is exactly the drift that produced a
   stale hand-maintained run list. `just app-test-covers-check` fails on a
   missing declaration and on a path that no longer resolves.

4. **Gate on `TUGAPP_APP_TEST=1`.** Use
   `describe.skipIf(!SHOULD_RUN)` at the top of every `describe`
   block. Without it, `bun x tsc --noEmit` runs are forced to skip
   too, which keeps CI honest.

5. **Import from `@/_harness`.** The path alias resolves to
   `tests/app-test/_harness/index.ts` regardless of subdirectory
   depth. Key exports:

   - `launchTugApp(opts)` — spawn + connect + version handshake.
   - `App` class — `evalJS`, `waitForCondition`, `close`, plus typed
     wrappers (`click`, `type`, `focusElement`, `reset`,
     `seedDeckState`, `getActiveCardId`, `getFocusedCardId`,
     `getCaretState`, `getFormControlValue`, `getDeckTrace`,
     `markDeckTrace`, `expectFocusedCard`, `expectCaret`, the full
     native-gesture family, `simulateApp*` lifecycle verbs,
     `appReload`, `quitGracefully`, `startTugcode` / `stopTugcode`,
     ...).
   - `toContainOrderedSubset` / `registerSubsetMatcher()` — partial
     ordered-subset matcher for deck-trace assertions.
   - `EXPECTED_SURFACE_VERSION` — pinned `window.__tug` surface
     version; must match tugdeck and the Swift bridge.

6. **Drive, assert, close.** Seed state, drive gestures through the
   typed wrappers, assert against both `__tug` state reads and the
   deck-trace ring:

   ```ts
   const mark = await app.markDeckTrace();
   await app.click({ selector: "[data-tab='b']" });
   const trace = await app.getDeckTrace({ since: mark });
   expect(trace).toContainOrderedSubset([
     { kind: "fr-flip" },
     { kind: "destination-flip", cardId: "b", to: true },
     { kind: "focus-call", cardId: "b" },
   ]);
   ```

   Call `registerSubsetMatcher()` once at module load to enable the
   `expect(...).toContainOrderedSubset(...)` fluent form.

7. **Always close in `finally`.** Orphaned subprocesses accumulate
   across runs and exhaust socket paths.

8. **Within a single file, prefer `app.reset()`** over re-spawning
   when scenarios share the app — it is orders of magnitude faster
   than a subprocess boot. No state is shared across files.

9. **Prefer production code paths over synthetic events.** For focus,
   call `app.focusElement(selector)` — this uses the same `.focus()`
   path that production code takes, keeping the test inside the
   fidelity envelope. For trusted clicks/drags/keys, use
   `nativeClick` / `nativeDrag` / `nativeKey` — these post real
   `CGEvent`s and exercise WebKit's `isTrusted: true` paths that
   synthesized DOM events cannot reach.

10. **`holdModifier` for modifier-bracketed sequences.** Hold modifiers
   atomically Swift-side rather than driving them as separate events:

   ```ts
   // Hold Cmd while executing multiple keystrokes as one sequence.
   await app.holdModifier(["cmd"], async (inner) => {
     await inner.rpcCall("nativeKey", { key: "a" });     // Cmd+A
     await inner.rpcCall("nativeKey", { key: "c" });     // Cmd+C
   });

   // Simpler shape for a single inner keystroke: just pass the
   // modifier directly to nativeKey.
   await app.nativeKey("a", ["cmd"]);
   ```

   Inner verbs inside a `holdModifier` thunk must be native gestures
   only — `evalJS` / `waitForCondition` / nested `holdModifier` all
   reject. Flatten modifier sets (`["cmd", "shift"]`) instead of
   nesting scopes.

11. **Keybinding chords: dispatch a synthetic `KeyboardEvent`, not
    `nativeKey`.** This is the one place item 8 inverts. A keybinding is
    defined purely by `event.code` + modifier flags — `matchKeybinding`
    reads nothing else and does not check `isTrusted` — so a synthetic
    keydown exercises the exact Stage-1 capture-listener → keybinding →
    chain-dispatch path a real keystroke would. Dispatch it on the
    focused element so it reaches the document-level capture listeners:

    ```ts
    // ⇧⌘P — a key-card-scoped keybinding chord.
    await app.evalJS(`(function(){
      var t = document.activeElement || document;
      return t.dispatchEvent(new KeyboardEvent("keydown", {
        code: "KeyP", key: "P", metaKey: true, shiftKey: true,
        bubbles: true, cancelable: true, composed: true,
      }));
    })()`);
    ```

    **Why not `nativeKey` for a chord.** A native `CGEvent` for a
    `⌘`-modified chord (especially two-modifier, e.g. `⇧⌘P`) is routed
    through windowserver, where the OS can intercept it as a menu
    key-equivalent or drop a modifier flag on the timing seam before it
    reaches the WKWebView. Single-modifier chords like `⌘A` usually
    survive; two-modifier ones are unreliable. Reserve `nativeKey` for
    what genuinely needs the trusted input stack — typing into a field,
    `Escape`/arrows during a drag, focus-moving Tab — and drive
    accelerator chords synthetically. (The focus-walk stage that owns
    `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` also reads only `event.key` + modifiers, so the
    same synthetic dispatch drives it.) See `at0085` (route `⇧⌘C`) and
    `at0105` (permission `⇧⌘P`); the binding's static contract is
    additionally pinned by `keybinding-map.test.ts` (pure-logic).

## TUGAPP_APP_TEST naming note

The Swift-side gate env var is still named `TUGAPP_APP_TEST=1`
even though the directory is now `tests/app-test/`. Renaming the env
var requires a coordinated Swift change with code-signing
implications — deferred. See
[`roadmap/tugplan-app-test-cleanup.md`](../../roadmap/tugplan-app-test-cleanup.md)
[D06].
