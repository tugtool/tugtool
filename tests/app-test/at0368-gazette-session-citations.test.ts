/**
 * at0368-gazette-session-citations.test.ts — a session named in prose becomes
 * the live citation chip, and the run it occupies is never claimed by the
 * wrong scan.
 *
 * A `project/callsign` token is shaped EXACTLY like a relative path, and the
 * answer that tells the two apart — does the ledger hold this session? —
 * arrives asynchronously, a verdict batch after the ink is painted. Scan order
 * cannot settle that: every scan's matches land in one array sorted by offset,
 * and whichever claims the run first blocks the other permanently. So a
 * pending session candidate RESERVES its run: marked by nobody, available to
 * nobody, until the verdict lands.
 *
 * All three outcomes are asserted on the real app, because all three are
 * properties of a DOM pass over rendered markdown and there is no in-process
 * DOM to run one in:
 *
 *  1. **Reserved.** Before the ledger answers, the session-shaped run carries
 *     no annotation of any kind — not a citation, and NOT the path annotation
 *     it would have been given had the path scan been allowed to take it.
 *  2. **Confirmed.** Once the ledger answers with the session, the run becomes
 *     a live `TugSessionCitation`, portaled into the span the annotator marked.
 *  3. **Refuted.** A look-alike the ledger has never heard of stays ordinary
 *     text — no chip, not even a slashed one. An unresolvable *declared* ref
 *     wears the slashed chip; a scanned token that turns out to be nothing is
 *     just a word.
 *
 * And the other direction, which is the half a session scan can break: a real
 * repository path in the same post still ends up a path annotation.
 *
 * The ledger's answer is delivered through `dispatchControlAction`, which is
 * the production `resolve_sessions_ok` handler — the same function the wire
 * frame reaches. Everything downstream of it is production: the citation
 * store, the verdict batch, the re-mark, the portal.
 *
 * And one geometry claim about the OTHER place a session shows up in this card
 * — the narrated session's own citation, which leads the provenance strip under
 * the post body. A session name is the one run whose length the user chooses,
 * so the atom has to be able to compress to whatever width it is given: it
 * gives way in a declared order (the minted handle first, the user's own words
 * last) but it always gives way, and it never hangs out of the rail.
 *
 * The strip is where it lives BECAUSE of the other half of the claim. The atom
 * used to ride the header's trailing edge, sharing one flex line with the
 * author and the clock — and whatever an over-wide atom would not give up, the
 * clock paid for by breaking across two lines. Nothing of variable width lands
 * in that header now, so the clock reads on one line no matter how long a name
 * the user chose; the assertion stays because that is the regression.
