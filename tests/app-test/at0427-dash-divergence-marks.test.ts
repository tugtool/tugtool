/**
 * at0427-dash-divergence-marks.test.ts — the dash lane says how far a dash has
 * drifted from its base, the moment it becomes true.
 *
 * A landing problem should surface when it becomes true, not when you try to
 * land. The marks are where that surfaces: `base overlap (N)` when uncommitted
 * work on the base touches files the dash also changes, `base +N` when the base
 * has moved ahead, `replay conflicts (N)` when replaying stopped on one, and a
 * quiet `replayed` receipt when history moved under the dash and nothing asked.
 *
 * Only the overlap mark is drivable here, and that is deliberate. The other
 * three need the *base branch* to move, and this suite runs against the live
 * repository — moving the base means committing to the developer's real `main`.
 * Branch motion is covered at the Rust layer in tempdir repos
 * (`tugdash-core`'s replay tests and `tugcast`'s base-motion engine tests);
 * what those cannot cover is that the composed entry reaches the lane and
 * paints, which is this file's whole job.
 *
 * The overlap is produced honestly: a real dash whose round changes a tracked
 * file, and the same file left uncommitted in the base checkout. The base
 * checkout is the developer's own tree, so the fixture is strict about it — it
 * refuses to run at all if that path is already dirty, and it restores both
 * bytes and mtime afterwards, which is `tugutil file probe`'s contract done in
 * `beforeAll`/`afterAll` because the assertion has to happen while the dirt is
 * live.
