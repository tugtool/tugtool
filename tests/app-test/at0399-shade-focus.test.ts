/**
 * at0399-shade-focus.test.ts — an open shade shows exactly one ring, and every
 * Tab stop under it is a place you can see.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Two defects, one theme — a mark or a stop that exists in the engine and
 * nowhere on screen.
 *
 * **History painted two rings.** The scrolling commit list held the shade's key
 * view, and because that key view was a non-button the engine ALSO projected
 * the persistent default ring onto Done beneath it. Both painted at once: a
 * keyboard-focus ring on the list and a Return promise on Done. The list was
 * never worth landing on — it is a reading surface with no act of its own — so
 * it leaves the walk entirely, Done becomes the shade's seeded key view, and
 * its one ring says both things at once.
 *
 * **The Changes shade had five ghost tabs.** That shade is passive, so the walk
 * is not trapped into it the way History's is; the Z2 status cells stayed
 * registered while sitting BEHIND the shade. Five Tabs in a row moved the ring
 * onto covered elements — a stop that looks like nothing at all. They leave the
 * cycle for as long as a shade is open.
 *
 * Alongside them, the Changes Z5. `data-shade-open` used to be a bare boolean
 * that stood the composer's default ring down, on the premise that "the shade
 * owns the default" — true of History, which has a Done, and false of Changes,
 * which has none and whose act is performed by the composer's own Commit
 * button. The attribute now carries the shade's NAME, and the commit button
 * declares itself the entry default with its Shift+Return chord
 * ([#chord-ring]) exactly as the prompt route's submit does.
 *
 * Not asserted here: the commit button's ring RESOLVING dashed→solid. That
 * needs a landable changeset, which an app-test's transient workspace cannot
 * hold still; the button is disabled without one and a disabled default rightly
 * promises nothing. The resolution itself is the same two CSS rules at0398
 * pins on the prompt Z5 — what this suite adds is that the commit button is
 * the wearer, and that nothing stands its ring down any more.
