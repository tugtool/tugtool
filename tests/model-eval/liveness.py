"""Is the live SharedAgent path answering, and inside its ceiling?

One digest through the real thing — control socket, running app, a warm Haiku
worker, normalizer, log — and three questions about the answer: did it arrive,
does it say anything, and did it take longer than `summarize` is allowed.

    just model-liveness              # against debug-main
    just model-liveness release-main

This is on-demand, not CI: it spends subscription tokens and needs a running
instance. Without one it **skips with exit 0** and names the remedy, because a
check that fails wherever the precondition is missing is one people learn to
ignore.

It asserts nothing about *what* the headline says. There is no ground truth for
"what is this session working on", and inventing one is what the fixed-corpus
quality eval was retired for. Register is `run.py`'s question; this one is
liveness.
