"""Score the SharedAgent's session headlines against a live Tug instance.

Drives the real thing end to end: the frozen digest goes over the control
socket to the running app, the SharedAgent's own `SUMMARIZE_INSTRUCTIONS` job
prompt and its Haiku worker answer, and tugcast normalizes the answer through
`headline_register` before logging it. What this scores is therefore the string
the PULSE strip would actually wear — prompt, model, and normalizer together —
not a re-implementation of any of them.

    just model-eval                 # against debug-main
    just model-eval release-main
    python3 run.py <instance> --retrospective

`--retrospective` drives the idle collapse's lane instead: the `.done.txt`
fixtures over the `summarize_done` task, scored against the past forms. The two
lanes are the same measurement of two different registers, so they share every
line of this file except which fixtures they read and which tense they expect.

Needs a running instance with the `pulse-overview`
tenant left on. Every headline is reported whether or not it passes; the summary
is a rate, not a gate, because a headline can satisfy every mechanical rule and
still describe the session badly. Read the lines.
