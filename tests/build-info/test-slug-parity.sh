# test-slug-parity.sh — verifies that the bash and Swift implementations
# of the branch-slug algorithm produce byte-for-byte identical output
# across the full case table.
#
# Drift between the two implementations would silently produce wrong
# bundle IDs (assign-bundle-id.sh would compute one slug; Swift's
# BuildInfo.instanceId would compute another), so this test runs on
# every commit that touches either side.
#
# Inputs:
#   tugrust/scripts/branch-slug.sh      — canonical bash slugifier
#   tugapp/Sources/BranchSlug.swift     — canonical Swift slugifier
#   tests/build-info/test-driver.swift  — shared case table (24 cases)
#
# Strategy:
#   1. Parse the inputs out of the Swift driver's case table via awk,
#      so adding a case to test-driver.swift extends both the unit
#      test (test-branch-slug.sh) and this parity test automatically.
#   2. Compile a one-shot Swift binary that reads inputs on stdin and
#      prints slugs (vs. spawning `swift` per case, which is ~1s/case).
#   3. Run the same inputs through `bash branch-slug.sh` line by line.
#   4. Diff the outputs.
