# Menus

*The macOS menu bar is a projection of the command registry. One TypeScript table states every user-invocable command — its title, how it dispatches, which menu item it drives, which chords it holds — and the host consumes that table as pushed data: enablement, check marks, dynamic titles, and key equivalents all arrive on one wire. Menu items act by sending control frames back into the web layer, never by mutating web state directly.*

*Cross-references: [commands.md](commands.md) (the registry itself, the two funnels, and [L30] — read that before adding a menu item), [action-naming.md](action-naming.md) (the registry layer above the three-way classification), [responder-chain.md](responder-chain.md) (`validateAction` / `queryActionState`), [app-test-harness.md](app-test-harness.md) (`menuSnapshot` / `menuItemState`). `[L##]` → [tuglaws.md](tuglaws.md).*

## The shape

```
command registry ──▶ host-menu-state aggregator ──▶ menuState push ──▶ MenuState cache
                                                                             │
                                                          validateMenuItem(_:) pulls
                                                          applyCommandChords() writes
WKWebView ◀── control frame ◀── NSMenuItem action
```

Two channels, one in each direction:

- **State out** — `tugdeck/src/lib/host-menu-state.ts` projects the deck store, the frontmost card's blocks, and the command registry into one payload; diffs it; coalesces on a microtask; posts to `webkit.messageHandlers.menuState`. `MainWindow` forwards it to `AppDelegate.updateMenuState`, which replaces the cached `MenuState` struct wholesale and then re-sweeps the menu bar's key equivalents.
- **Commands in** — every menu item's selector calls `sendControl(...)`; `dispatchAction` forks a registry command to `dispatchCommand` and everything else to the data-frame handler map. No menu item reaches into web state by any other route.

## The menuState wire contract

Posted by the aggregator; parsed by `AppDelegate`'s `MenuState` struct. **Keep both sides in sync** — they are the two halves of one contract.

```

### The `commands` block

Keyed by `NSUserInterfaceItemIdentifier`, not by command id: the host already switches on the identifier, so joining on it means the host needs no map of its own.

`chord` is **three-state**, and all three are load-bearing:

| Wire | Meaning |
|---|---|
| key absent | leave the item's constructed key equivalent alone |
| `null` | detach it — the chord falls through to the web view |
| a spec | apply it |

Swift distinguishes the first two by the key's *presence*, since an explicit JSON `null` arrives as `NSNull` and would otherwise read as "absent". Getting that wrong turns every detach into a no-op.

`enabled` is optional for the same reason a chord can move without an enablement moving: an item's chord can be the registry's while its predicate stays the host's. View ▸ Zoom In is the standing case — it reads `window.currentPageZoom`, which is the host's own property — so its gate carries a chord and no verdict.

### Publication discipline

- The deck half comes from the aggregator's own `DeckManager` subscription (wired once at boot in `main.tsx`), plus subscriptions to `cardSessionBindingStore`, `cardTitleStore`, and the keymap registry — every store a gate reads but the deck cannot see.
- The `session` and `file` blocks are published by their cards' menu-state effects, which **subscribe to the stores directly** ([L22]) — publication is a side effect, not a render derivation. Every card publishes unconditionally; the aggregator decides which block rides the payload.
- The `edit` block and the `commands` block are computed in one place, from one chain walk, in the flush. A caller that could refresh one without the other would be able to make them disagree.
- **Undo / Redo stay two-path.** For chain editors (CM6) the items round-trip `undo`/`redo` control frames into the focused editor's own history, with depth-accuracy from `validateAction` and a menu noun from the editor's label registry. For browser-native text controls (`nativeUndoToken` non-zero) the host validates LIVE from `webView.undoManager` and executes the native selectors — the only route to a native input's undo stack — kept card-safe by clearing that stack on every token change.
- **Cut / Paste / Select All / Undo / Redo carry a liveness gate.** The chain's first responder is deliberately sticky: a canvas-background click blurs the editor to body but demotes nothing, so a stale FR would keep answering for a visibly deactivated card. Editing actions require actual keyboard focus. Copy is NOT gated — it must keep working for read-only selections, where the selection lives without DOM focus on the responder.
- **Capability flips inside a focused responder** (an editor's undo depth changing as the user types) don't bump the chain's validation version, by design: typing must never re-render chain-subscribed components. Substrates call `requestMenuStateRefresh()` instead, and the CM6 plugin fires it only when availability or label actually *flips*. Widening that trigger while widening the closure's work is the way to put the whole mirror on the keystroke path.
- The aggregator posts only when the serialized payload changes — wire traffic is proportional to menu-relevant change, not store churn.
- Before the first push, the cache is `MenuState.empty`: every gated item validates disabled and every item shows its **constructed** key equivalent. That is the correct cold-start posture, not a bug — and it is why a rebound chord shows its default for the moment before the frontend's own boot closes the window.

## Validation: the mirror first, then two survivors

All enablement flows through `AppDelegate.validateMenuItem(_:)`, keyed on the item's identifier and reading only the cached `MenuState`. AppKit re-validates on menu open and on key-equivalent dispatch. **Nothing pushes `isEnabled` imperatively** — `autoenablesItems` is on, so a stored `isEnabled` is silently overridden by the validator's permissive default, and every gate must be a validator branch. (Four sites once tried; none of them worked, and all four are validator branches now.)

| Tier | Source | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — the registry gate | `menuState.commands[<identifier>]` | Every statically-built item whose command has an answer: enablement, check mark, and dynamic title, all from the one table the frontend dispatches from |
| 2 — host-owned live state | `window.currentPageZoom`, `webView.undoManager` | The View zoom bounds, and Undo / Redo while a native text control is focused. Neither fact is the frontend's to know |
| 3 — host-owned readiness | `frontendReady` | About and Settings each open a card, so both are dark until the frontend has signalled ready. This one cannot be a registry gate *in principle*: before the frontend is ready there is no push, so an item that took its answer from the mirror would be answered by the mirror's absence — which reads as enabled |
| 4 — menu structure | — | The Permission Mode submenu's *parent*, which carries no command. Its contents each have one; the parent gates on the same condition so the submenu dims as a whole |
| 5 — parameterized families | built at rebuild time | Themes, the Window pane list, Open Recent — their items are constructed in `menuNeedsUpdate` with their enablement and marks already set, so they are structurally outside a static mirror |

An item absent from `commands` falls through to whichever tier still owns it, which is what let the migration proceed one item at a time: an entry is mirrored in the same change that deletes its hand-rolled case, so exactly one definition of its enablement is ever live.

The Session menu is **disabled, not hidden** — stable menu bars preserve discoverability. The Maker menu is the deliberate exception: it hides when maker mode is off, because maker mode is a *mode*, not a focus state. Maker mode is not a setting — it is derived from the build profile (on in debug bundles, off in release ones and under the app-test harness), so the menu is present-but-hidden in exactly the builds that were never meant to show it. A hidden menu's chords fall through to the web view unless the item sets `allowsKeyEquivalentWhenHidden`, so the Maker menu's ⌘L / ⌥⌘L / ⇧⌘R / ⌘T reach JS while maker mode is off.

## Chords: four layers, and the menu bar is the outermost

**AppKit resolves a menu item's key equivalent before the web view sees a `keydown` at all.** A chord on a menu item is therefore not "first in the JS order" — it is a layer *above* the JS order entirely, and it preempts every scoped binding regardless of focus. The full resolution order is:

1. **The native menu** — any item carrying the chord, if its menu is visible (or `allowsKeyEquivalentWhenHidden`).
2. **The focus mode** — a floating surface's accelerators.
3. **The responder walk**, innermost first.
4. **The global layer.**

Three consequences, and each of them is a decision rather than a detail:

- **A disabled menu item eats its chord with a beep.** It does not fall through. So dimming an item is never the whole answer: a command whose chord should stay reachable while it is inapplicable must *detach* the chord, not merely dim the item.
- **Promoting a command to a menu item takes its chord out of the JS funnel**, globally and unconditionally, including inside every text surface. Menu placement is a chord decision before it is a discoverability one.
- **A `menuEligible` binding must not share a chord with a scoped binding.** The scoped one is not shadowed, it is dead. `keymapRegistry.lintChordCollisions` is the lint that keeps a promotion from silently taking a chord some card wanted.

`resolveChord(chord)` answers this stack for any chord, with `active` / `shadowedBy` per entry, and the Keyboard Shortcuts card renders from it — which is why `pdf-view.tsx` no longer has to reason about ⌘1–⌘3 by hand.

### Where a key equivalent comes from

Construction-time `keyEquivalent` literals in `buildMenuBar` are **defaults**, not the last word. `applyCommandChords()` sweeps `NSApp.mainMenu` recursively and writes what `commands[<id>].chord` says. Because `tugapp/Sources` contains no `performKeyEquivalent` override, no `NSEvent` monitor, and no `keyDown` override, every native key claim in Tug is an `NSMenuItem` key equivalent — so that sweep is complete coverage of the native side, and nothing can hold a chord the keymap cannot see.

The sweep runs from **two** sites, and the second one is not optional: `updateMenuState(_:)` for the whole tree, and the tail of every `menuNeedsUpdate` rebuild for the menu it just rebuilt. The View, Window pane-list, theme, and Open Recent menus reconstruct their items from construction-time literals, and the push only fires on a *changed* projection — so a rebuild after a rebind would restore the literal and keep it until some unrelated state change came along.

Key-equivalent mutation is **banned inside `validateMenuItem`**: that runs inside AppKit's closed-menu key-equivalent scan, where mutating a key equivalent is undefined.

### The `code` → `keyEquivalent` conversion

`chord-format.ts` owns both alphabets and is the only place either is spelled. The conversion returns the character and the mask **together**, never independently: shifted punctuation resolves to the shifted *character* with `shift` dropped from the mask, because AppKit renders the character it is given. Zoom In is `("+", [.command])`, not `("=", [.command, .shift])` — computing the two apart is exactly how ⌘+ turns into ⇧⌘=.

An untabled code throws in dev and publishes `null` in production, so a bad binding detaches a chord rather than silently mis-assigning one.

<!-- /generated:chords -->

Chords the user has rebound are not in this table — it is the *defaults*. Overrides live in tugbank under `dev.tugtool.keymap`, one key per command id holding a JSON binding list; an absent key means the default, and an **empty list** means deliberately unbound, which is a different and durable answer. The host never reads that domain: overrides reach it the same way every other chord does, through the push.

## The command catalog

Every menu item, the command behind it, and where each answer comes from. Generated from the registry — a hand-maintained join is a hand-maintained lie.

### A fallback belongs to the command, never to a door

A command with more than one tier — "ask the key card, and if nothing claims it, do the deck-wide thing" — must spell both tiers out behind its own id, in a `registry` handler. Not in the chord pipeline, not in the menu path.

Every command has several doors: a chord, a menu item, the palette, a control frame. They converge on `dispatchCommand(id)` and nowhere earlier. So a second tier implemented at one door is not a fallback, it is a behavior that one door has and the others do not — and because the routing field still reads `key-card`, nothing about the entry says so.

⌥⇥ (`cycle-focus-mode`) is the case that taught this. It routed `key-card`, and its fallback sat in `responder-chain-provider`'s scoped-action-binding branch, which the global chord path does not reach. The gesture worked on the one card that registers a handler and was dead everywhere else — which was every surface the fallback existed for. The comment above it read "the fallback lives here, at the dispatch site, where it provably runs," which is why it survived a whole phase: it named the failure and asserted it was impossible.

## The clipboard exception — native re-dispatch, not a round-trip

The clipboard Edit items (Cut / Copy / Paste / Delete / Select All) do **not** round-trip through a control frame. A control frame is async and leaves the JS clipboard call outside the user gesture, which the browser blocks; and WebKit's native `copy:` / `cut:` / `paste:` already drive the system pasteboard correctly. So each item targets a thin AppDelegate wrapper (`performCopy:` etc.) that re-dispatches its native AppKit selector to the first responder synchronously. Routing through the wrapper — rather than binding the item straight to `copy:` — is what puts **enablement** under the registry gate while leaving the action byte-identical to AppKit's own.

Those five commands appear in the registry with `routing: "native"` and in `NATIVE_LOCKED`: the mechanism could rebind them, the policy says no.

## The identifier namespace

Every `NSMenuItem` — including dynamically built ones — carries a stable `NSUserInterfaceItemIdentifier`, namespaced by menu:

```
app.about        file.newSessionCard      edit.findNext        session.stop
view.theme.<name>  window.pane.<n>        maker.devTools       help.shortcuts
session.permissionMode.<mode>             view.zoomInAlias (hidden ⌘= alias)
```

Rules:

- **Identity never rides the title.** Titles localize and (for dynamic items) carry runtime data; the identifier never does. Tests, the harness, and the registry's `menuItemId` join address items by identifier only.
- Dynamic items mint identifiers at build time (`view.theme.<name>`, `window.pane.<n>` by position, since pane ids are session-random).
- AppKit injects its own identified items (dictation, emoji palette) and may clone the fullscreen item into its managed window-tiling section — uniqueness is guaranteed only within our `<menu>.` namespaces.

The Window menu is special: it is `NSApp.windowsMenu`, so AppKit owns auto-added entries in it. The dynamic pane list is managed as a sectioned slice — remove exactly the `window.pane.*` items, re-insert after the anchor separator — and the menu is **never** wholesale-rebuilt (`removeAllItems()` is forbidden there). Automatic window **tabbing** items are suppressed app-wide via `NSWindow.allowsAutomaticWindowTabbing = false` at launch — Tug navigates by cards and panes, not native NSWindow tabs.

## The theme submenu

Its **membership** is a filesystem scan of `tugdeck/styles/themes/*.css` under the configured source tree, so the submenu is empty without one — genuinely dynamic, and it stays a scan. Its **checkmark** rides the push (`activeTheme`): the frontend changes the theme by paths the host never sees, so a value cached at selection time would go stale, and the host used to re-read tugbank on every menu open — a subprocess read on the path that has to finish before the menu can draw.

## Testing

The harness verbs `menuSnapshot` / `menuItemState` report each item's *validated* enabled state — the snapshot runs the same `NSMenuItemValidation` resolution AppKit uses, after calling each menu's `menuNeedsUpdate` — plus the checkmark `state`, the `keyEquivalent`, and the `modifierMask`.

| Coverage | Where |
|---|---|
| Structure, deck tier, maker gate, session tier | `at0167`–`at0174` |
| The registry gate: enablement, state, and titles from the mirror | `at0180` |
| Native key equivalents derived from the keymap, including a rebuild | `at0181` |
| A user override round trip, through the store and through the pane | `at0182` |

Dynamic items rebuild in `menuNeedsUpdate`; the snapshot calls it, so they are visible without opening a menu by hand.
