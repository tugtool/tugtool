# The App-Test Harness

*The integration-test harness that drives a real `Tug.app` subprocess via the DEBUG-only `TestHarness` Unix-socket bridge. Why it exists, what it can and cannot assert, the lifecycle model, the trusted-event surface, and how it relates to the macOS code-signing pipeline. Read this before changing the harness, before classifying a new test as smoke vs. scenario, or before claiming a behavior has been "covered" by app-test.*

## What the harness is

The app-test harness is a Bun-side test driver that launches `Tug.app` as a subprocess and talks to it over a Unix-domain socket exposed by a DEBUG-only `TestHarness` listener inside the app. From a test author's perspective, it looks like a normal `bun:test` file: import `launchTugApp` from `@/_harness`, call it inside an `async test(...)`, drive gestures and DOM reads through the returned `App` object, close the app in a `finally` block.

What makes the harness interesting is what is on the other end of that socket. It is not a fake DOM, not a headless rendering shim. It is the real `Tug.app` bundle running the real WKWebView, hosting the real tugdeck bundle, executing the real production JavaScript. The harness is the only test surface in the repo that exercises the actual WebKit code paths that ship to users — selection rendering, gesture focus-lock, drag-to-select, double-click word boundaries, modifier-key accelerators, scroll containers, paint timing.

The colocated unit tests under `tugdeck/src/__tests__/` are pure-logic tests (stores, protocol, math, validators) — no DOM. Anything that depends on WebKit's `isTrusted: true` paths, on focus surviving a real gesture, or on the timing of WebKit's gesture focus-lock belongs in app-test.

---

## The trusted-event problem

Most JavaScript test environments synthesize events: `new MouseEvent("click", { ... })`, `dispatchEvent`. Synthesized events have `event.isTrusted === false`. WebKit (and every other browser engine) gates several behaviors on `isTrusted: true`:

- **Default focus on click.** Clicking an element does not move focus to it unless the click is trusted. A synthesized click on `<input>` will fire the click handler but the input will not receive focus.
- **Drag selection.** Mouse-down + mouse-move + mouse-up only initiates a text selection range when the events are trusted.
- **Double-click word selection.** WebKit's word-boundary detection only fires on trusted double-clicks within a tight time window.
- **Modifier-key accelerators.** Cmd+A select-all, Cmd+C copy, Cmd+V paste — the keyboard shortcuts WebKit handles internally — only fire on trusted key events.

A test that synthesizes events lives in a different universe from the user. It can drive `onClick`, but it cannot drive default-focus-on-click. It can dispatch `keydown`, but it cannot drive Cmd+A selection. The harness exists because trusted-event paths are first-class user behavior in tugdeck, and a test surface that cannot drive them cannot prove the app works.

The harness solves this by posting events at the **OS level**, via Swift's `CGEvent.post` ([D02] in `tugplan-in-app-bridge.md`). A `CGEvent` posted from Swift is indistinguishable from a hardware event as far as WebKit is concerned: `isTrusted` is `true`, default-focus runs, drag selection initiates, Cmd+A reaches the selection model. This is the entire reason the harness exists as a subprocess driver instead of an in-process fake-DOM shim.

## Lifecycle model: one App per file

Each test file launches its own `App` via `launchTugApp()` and closes it in a `finally` block. Inside a single file, tests may share the `App` if they call `app.reset()` between scenarios — but **no state is shared across files**. This matches the bridge's single-connection contract ([D12] in `tugplan-in-app-bridge.md`) and the regression gate in `harness-smoke/double-connect.test.ts`.

The reasons are not arbitrary:

- **Crash isolation.** One test file's hang or assertion failure does not poison the next. The harness can leave a subprocess in any state — including wedged — and the next file starts from a clean process boot.
- **WKUserScript injection is one-shot.** The script that sets `window.__tugTestMode = true` runs at process start via `WKUserScript`. There is no API to "downgrade" a live WebView back to non-test mode. To get a fresh non-test-mode WebView, you spawn a new app.
- **Per-spawn log files.** Stdout / stderr capture rotates per spawn. Failed-test diagnostics stay scoped to the file that produced them.

Within a single file, prefer `app.reset()` over re-spawning. Reset clears tugdeck state, resets the responder chain, and restores the deck to a known baseline — orders of magnitude faster than a subprocess boot. The pattern matters because some flake patterns surface only when state leaks between scenarios; reset makes that leak detectable.

---

## Fidelity envelope

The harness is a behavioral driver, not a visual renderer. It cannot assert:

- **Caret blink.** WebKit owns the blink timer; the harness has no surface to read paint state.
- **Paint correctness.** The harness reads DOM and computed styles, not rendered pixels. A bug where the right element is in the right position with the right styles but the wrong color is invisible to app-test.
- **Perceived snappiness.** The harness times state transitions, not perceived latency. A 100ms vs. 500ms paint delay is the same to app-test if the underlying state change is symmetric.
- **GPU compositor behavior.** Transform-related bugs that manifest only under hardware acceleration are out of envelope.

What the harness *can* assert is the union of:

- **DOM state.** Element presence, attributes, computed styles, bounds, focus, selection.
- **`__tug` state reads.** Active card, focused card, deck state, EM-card state, deck-trace ring.
- **Trusted gesture outcomes.** Default-focus on click, drag selection range, double-click word boundary, modifier-key behavior.
- **Lifecycle ordering.** When a will/did pair fires, when `onCardActivated` runs, when capture-phase save invariants hold.
- **Subprocess-level guarantees.** Cold-boot persistence, app-reload state restoration, `quitGracefully` flush, cross-process tugbank reads.

When a bug falls outside the envelope, mark the residual as "manual verification required" in the test comment. Do not paper over an out-of-envelope assertion with a weaker proxy — a passing weaker proxy is worse than an honest skip, because the skip surfaces in code review while the proxy hides indefinitely.

The full envelope spec lives in the "Fidelity limits" section of [`roadmap/tugplan-in-app-bridge.md`](../roadmap/tugplan-in-app-bridge.md).

## The Phase A surface: native gestures, keyboard, introspection

The harness exposes two parallel families of input verbs:

- **Synthesized JS gestures** (`app.click`, `app.type`, `app.focusElement`) — fast, reliable, but `isTrusted: false`. Use these when the assertion is about a JS handler running, not about a WebKit gesture path.
- **Native CGEvent gestures** (`app.nativeClick`, `app.nativeKey`, `app.nativeDrag`, etc.) — backed by Swift's `CGEvent.post` per [D02] + [Q05] in `tugplan-in-app-bridge.md`. These post real OS events that WebKit treats as hardware. Use these when the assertion is about default-focus, selection, or any `isTrusted: true` path.

Native gestures cover single click, double click, right click, drag (endpoint-only), mouse-down / mouse-up primitives, key press with modifiers, and ASCII typing. The `holdModifier(mods, async thunk)` shape lets a test wrap a sequence of inner verbs in a modifier-pressed scope, executed atomically Swift-side so the modifier state cannot drift between the outer test and the inner gesture sequence. Inner verbs inside a `holdModifier` thunk are restricted to native gestures only — `evalJS` / `waitForCondition` / nested `holdModifier` reject. The restriction is intentional: a `holdModifier` block must complete deterministically, and a JS-side wait inside it would let modifier state outlive the intended scope.

Introspection is pure DOM reads. `getElementText`, `getElementValue`, `getElementAttribute`, `getElementBounds`, `getElementState`, `getActiveElement`, `getSelection`, `getComputedStyleValue` — all run via `evalJS` against the live WebView's DOM. None of these post events; they observe.

The procedural details (the typed wrappers' signatures, the worked examples, the `markDeckTrace` pattern) are in [`tests/app-test/README.md`](../tests/app-test/README.md). This document explains why the surface exists and what it costs to extend; the README explains how to use it.

## Selection is derived, not remembered

Every app-test launches its own `Tug.app` subprocess, and whole invocations are serialized behind a machine-wide gate. Running the corpus is therefore expensive in the one currency that matters during development — the time between making a change and learning whether it broke something. The cost is why a run must be *selected*, and the selection must be *derived* rather than curated by hand: a hand-maintained "the tests we run" list decays silently, because a test added after the list was written is simply absent from it, and nothing fails to announce that.

So coverage is declared at the test, in the header docblock:

```
 * @covers tugdeck/src/components/lens/
 * @covers tugdeck/src/lib/lens-store/
```

`just app-test-changed` resolves the working diff through those declarations and runs the matching set; `just app-test-covers-check` fails on a test that declares nothing and on a path that no longer resolves. Colocation is the load-bearing property — a declaration that lives next to the test it describes moves when the test moves and is visible in the diff that changes the test, which is what a central manifest cannot offer.

A few paths resist coverage-based scoping and are therefore excluded from it by design: the harness itself (`tests/app-test/_harness/`, `tugapp/Sources/TestHarness/`) and the deck's entry point (`tugdeck/src/main.tsx`, `tugdeck/index.html`). They run before any test's first assertion, so no `@covers` line can bound their blast radius; the selector emits a **core-tier advisory** rather than pretending to a scope it cannot compute. The advisory's answer is the core tier below — a minute of broad smoke — not the full corpus. That list stays deliberately tiny: an ordinary component, however widely mounted, is covered by name, and flagging such components turned the advisory into noise that fired on every substantial diff and read as a standing request to run everything.

The no-argument `just app-test` is a **curated core tier** of roughly twenty tests — one per load-bearing surface — not a sweep. It answers "does the app still fundamentally work," and its incompleteness is the point: it is a deliberately-chosen sample whose members are listed with a one-line rationale each in the `app-test` recipe. `just app-test-all` is the only command that claims to run everything.

## The accessibility-grant relationship

Posting a `CGEvent` requires `Tug.app` to hold the macOS Accessibility (TCC) grant — System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility, with `Tug.app` toggled on. Without the grant, `CGEvent.post` silently no-ops: every native gesture appears to succeed, but no event reaches the WebView, every assertion fails, and the failure attribution is misleading because the verbs returned `void` rather than throwing.

The harness preflights the grant on every `launchTugApp` call and throws `AccessibilityPermissionMissingError` with actionable guidance (the bundle path / id, the `tccutil reset` recipe for stale grants) when the preflight fails. Protocol-only smoke tests (`harness-smoke/smoke.test.ts`, `double-connect.test.ts`, `log-capture.test.ts`, `wait-for-condition.test.ts`) opt out of the preflight via `skipAccessibilityPreflight: true` so they remain runnable on machines that have not yet completed the one-time grant dance. Scenario tests (`at{NNNN}-*.test.ts`) and `harness-smoke/smoke-native.test.ts` keep the default strict preflight — if the grant is missing, the failure attribution is instant.

The grant is not keyed to the `Tug.app` filename or the bundle id alone. macOS's TCC database keys grants on the bundle's **designated requirement (DR)** — a string composed of the bundle identifier *plus* the leaf hash of the certificate that signed the bundle. Two binaries signed by the same identity share a DR and share a grant; anything that changes the signature invalidates the grant. Xcode's default ad-hoc signing produces a fresh random signature on every `xcodebuild` invocation, which would mean re-granting Accessibility every minute in a tight test-edit loop.

The fix is the `Tug Dev` self-signed identity from the code-signing pipeline. `just build-app` re-signs the bundle with the developer's `Tug Dev` identity after `xcodebuild` completes; `just app-test` re-signs defensively per invocation if the bundle's current DR drifts from the sentinel at `.tugtool/code-sign-fingerprint`. Same identity → same DR → grant persists. The escape hatch `APP_TEST_SKIP_RESIGN=1 just app-test` skips the re-sign for the rare case where the re-sign step itself is what you want to investigate; tests that need `CGEvent.post` will fail under that flag, tests that don't will pass. The deep dive on signing — why self-signed, what invalidates the grant, the DR drift detection mechanism — lives in [code-signing-mac.md](code-signing-mac.md). This document only points there.

## Instance isolation — the invariant

An app-test launch, a live interactive instance (`just app-debug`, `just app-release`), and **another worktree's app-test world** must all be **completely disjoint**: a test run can never disturb a developer's running session, and one worktree's run can never disturb (or even reach) another worktree's. Every per-instance resource derives from the runtime identity `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` (the harness mints `apptest-<wtslug>-<uuid>` per launch — the worktree's branch slug rides in the id so the recipe's destructive sweeps can scope to their own worktree; the dev loop uses `debug-main` / `release-main`), and nothing is shared across identities:

| Resource | Keyed on | Where |
|---|---|---|
| App bundle / product name | `TUG_FORCE_BUNDLE_ID` (app-test always `dev.tugtool.app.apptest` → `Tug-apptest.app`) — deliberately the SAME for every worktree, so the one AX grant (keyed on the path-independent designated requirement) covers them all | `product-name-from-cwd.sh`, `bundle-id-from-cwd.sh` |
| Xcode build output (DerivedData) | per-variant `-derivedDataPath` keyed on `PRODUCT_NAME`, **plus the worktree slug for forced-identity builds** (`Tug-apptest-<wtslug>`) — Xcode's *default* DerivedData is shared per-project, so without this, building the app-test bundle would overwrite a live `app-debug` bundle's `.app`, and without the slug one worktree's build/re-sign would clobber the bundle another worktree's run is executing | `derived-data-path.sh` |
| Data dir / tugbank.db / sessions.db / Logs | full `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` | `tugcore::instance` |
| tugbank notify socket, app↔tugcast control socket | **short token** `fnv1a32(id)` (8 hex) — long IDs would overflow `sun_path` (~104 B) | `tugcore::instance::short_token`, `InstanceConfig.shortToken` |
| tugcast HTTP + Vite ports | hash of `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` into a window. **App-test draws from a dedicated window** (tugcast 55400–55499, Vite 55500–55599) disjoint from dev/release (55300/55200) | `tugcore::ports` |
| tmux server | per-instance `tmux -L tug-<short_token>` — a *private daemon*, not a shared server with namespaced sessions | `tugcast::feeds::terminal` |
| Claude / tugcode subprocess | tugcast's own process group (`setpgid` + `kill(0)` on exit) | `tugcast/src/main.rs` |
| **Native input / app activation / key window** | **not divisible** — these are login-session singletons, so they are serialized, not namespaced: the whole `just app-test` invocation runs under `tugutil host gate run --name apptest` | `tugcore::ports::APPTEST_GATE_PORT`, `tug::commands::gate` |

### Background is the default; the screen-takers are a declared set

An app-test does not take your machine. The app launches as an accessory (`NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)`, `open -g`), keyboard events are addressed to its process with `CGEvent.postToPid`, and mouse events are synthesized as `NSEvent`s and dispatched straight into its window — AppKit refuses to route mouse events to an inactive app above the window level, so going through the window is the only way in. A run happens around you while you keep working.

That cannot be made universal, because for a minority of tests activation *is* the subject: app resign / become-active cycles, key-window-gated responder routing, and `document.hasFocus()` — which WebKit ties to *application* activation, not key-window status (an experiment making the window key without activating did not restore it, and broke `at0201`'s activation-click semantics). Those tests pass `foreground: true`, which restores session-tap posting and real activation, and they genuinely take the screen.

**The foreground tier is declared, not inferred.** Each such file carries `@foreground` in its header docblock beside `@covers`, and `just app-test-foreground-check` fails when the tag and the file's actual behavior disagree in either direction. The declaration has to be static because the gate must decide *before* launching anything — a runtime signal arrives after the app already has the screen.

A file takes the screen two ways, and the check knows both. The first is the `foreground: true` launch option. The second is calling an app-lifecycle verb — `simulateAppResign` / `BecomeActive` / `Hide` / `Unhide` — which reaches `NSApp.activate(ignoringOtherApps:)` and a Finder activation inside the app no matter which mode it launched in. Modelling only the launch option let a file seize the screen with no tag on it, so the gate never announced what it was about to do; that is what an undeclared screen-taker feels like from the outside. A lifecycle verb additionally *requires* the launch option: without it the app was never active, `NSApp.deactivate()` is a silent no-op, `didResignActive` never posts, and the verb activates Finder on its way to failing on its 1000ms timeout. The check reports that case separately, because it is both a stolen focus and a broken test.

### `document.hasFocus()` is not a readiness gate

The tier grew to forty files before anyone asked whether forty tests could really need the screen. They could not. Twelve were foreground because they opened with `await app.waitForCondition('document.hasFocus()')` — used as a *boot barrier*, a way to say "the app is up and focus has landed" — and since that predicate can never go true in a background launch, each one had `foreground: true` bolted on to make its own barrier satisfiable. The barrier was self-inflicted: in every case the very next line already waited on the real readiness condition (the rows rendered, the ring landed), so deleting the `hasFocus` wait cost nothing and the tests pass backgrounded, faster. One file carried only the copy-pasted *comment* explaining the foreground launch, with no such wait anywhere in it.

The distinction that actually matters: **app-level keyboard focus works fine in a background window, and only the painted caret needs `document.hasFocus()`.** Keys arrive by `postToPid`, the engine's ring and cursor are DOM state, and CM6 accepts typed input and updates its document — `at0241` types into a CM6 editor and asserts the result with no activation at all. What WebKit withholds from an inactive app is `.cm-focused` and the caret's paint, so a test whose subject is caret *rendering* (`at0048`, `at0049`, `at0254`) genuinely belongs in the tier and a test whose subject is where the ring went does not.

So: never gate on `document.hasFocus()` to mean "ready". Wait on the thing you are about to assert against. Reaching for `foreground: true` to make a wait succeed is a sign the wait is wrong, not that the test needs the screen.

A run containing any of them raises the question in the Session card — over `tugutil host ask` → `POST /api/ask` → an inline dialog → back — and then **runs the background tests while it waits**, saving the screen-takers for last. The run is partitioned, not gated: a test that needs no permission is never blocked by one that does. That distinction is load-bearing rather than cosmetic, and getting it wrong the first time made a bare `just app-test` hold sixteen background files behind a prompt none of them needed.

Two rules about *when*, both learned the hard way:

- The ask is raised **before the invocation gate is taken**, never while holding it — a run waiting on a human must not block every other worktree.
- It is raised **immediately**, not at the moment the first screen-taker is reached. Deferring it puts the dialog on screen minutes later, after the developer has moved on, where a timeout silently means "skipped".

And one about *whether it may wait at all*. **The question is a chance to intervene, not a request for permission**, and it resolves itself: it carries `--unattended run-all`, the dialog counts thirty seconds down in plain sight, and at zero it commits the selected option. An unanswered question therefore runs the screen-takers rather than blocking, because at an empty keyboard there is nobody to disturb and no reason to park the run. The mechanism generalizes — any `tugutil host ask` caller may name the answer silence means — and it earns the right to run unasked by being honest about three things: the countdown commits *the selected option* (so moving the selection to "skip" and walking away skips), touching the selection re-arms the count (so nobody is timed out mid-decision), and the option it will commit is the one it opens preselected (so no control ever rests showing something other than what will happen). Escape still declines at once. `tugcast` answers with the same choice if the deck stops ticking mid-count, so no path leads back to a blocked caller.

`TUG_APPTEST_ASSUME` answers ahead of time for scripted runs and is checked before any work starts. With no instance to ask, the run proceeds after naming the screen-takers on stderr — blocking a terminal-only run that could never have shown a dialog is the worse failure.

### The invocation gate

The lifecycle tests drive `NSApp.activate`/`deactivate`, and foreground-tier gestures still post via `CGEvent.post(tap: .cgSessionEventTap)` — keyboard focus, the frontmost window, and screen-coordinate clicks belong to the *login session*, not to any instance. No amount of per-instance namespacing makes two concurrent native-gesture runs safe; serialization is physics. The `app-test` recipe therefore re-execs its entire body under a machine-wide gate: `tugutil host gate run --name apptest --label <wtslug>`.

The gate is a **localhost port bind** (`tugcore::ports::APPTEST_GATE_PORT`, a well-known port outside every hashed window), not a lock file — this project does not use lock files. Binding is exclusive by kernel construction and the kernel frees the port on any holder death, including SIGKILL, so no stale-lock state can exist. The holder serves a live JSON greeting (`{gate, label, pid, since}`) to every connection; a queued invocation prints `gate 'apptest' held by <worktree> (pid …, since …) — waiting…` and blocks reading that connection until EOF (the holder's exit), then races to re-bind — event-driven, no polling. A non-gate listener on the port fails the greeting handshake and the acquirer errors out instead of waiting. `--no-wait` turns queueing into a fail-fast exit for scripted callers.

Two corollaries that bit us before and must not regress:

- **Kills are identity-checked.** `tugutil host instance stop` and tugcast's `--force` both verify a PID is still the process they registered (by command / registry ownership) before signalling. A PID is recycled the instant its process dies, so a stale registry entry can name a PID the OS has handed to an *unrelated* process — signalling it blind was how an app-test teardown could SIGKILL a live debug instance's child. Never signal a PID you cannot confirm is yours.
- **No *unprobed* cross-instance sweeps.** The rule used to be a blanket ban on reaching into another instance's namespace, resting on the claim that a crash-orphaned socket is "a harmless dead file" that `$TMPDIR` reaps. It is not: a 2026-08-02 audit found **9,833** dead `tugcast-ctl-*.sock` files, 8,765 stray test DBs, 188 orphaned data dirs, and a tmux server that had idled for 20 hours. Per-launch uniqueness is exactly what makes a leak invisible — it never collides, so nothing ever notices it.

  The invariant that replaces the ban is narrower and stronger: **a cross-instance sweep is permitted only when every deletion is gated by a signal a live resource passes.** A `connect()` probe for sockets, a registry lookup for tmux servers and data dirs, PPID 1 for processes — plus a minimum-age floor on everything the registry answers for. `tugcore::janitor` is the one implementation; `tugutil host sweep` and tugcast's startup hook are its only callers.

  What stays banned is what was actually dangerous: **deleting on a name pattern alone.** The one such glob that ever existed (`tugcast-ctl-*.sock`) was unscoped and could reach a live dev instance's socket. Probing dissolves that objection; skipping the probe reinstates it.

  Two things the probes do *not* tell you, both load-bearing:

  - **A saturated live listener is indistinguishable from a corpse.** On macOS an `AF_UNIX` listener whose backlog is full fails `connect()` with `ECONNREFUSED` — the same errno a dead socket file gives, and it appears at backlog+1 connections. Errno discipline (unlink only on `ECONNREFUSED`/`ENOENT`) is necessary but *not sufficient*; the socket pass also skips any name belonging to a live registered instance, and applies the age floor.
  - **The registry is a lagging signal during startup.** `write_bundle_path_marker()` runs near the top of tugcast startup while `registry::register` cannot run until after the port bind, so for a real interval a *booting* instance owns a data dir and a tmux server while matching the orphan signature exactly. Anyone adding a registry-gated deletion must put `MIN_DEBRIS_AGE_SECS` under it.

  The worktree dimension of the old rule still holds for the *live*-process teardown the recipe does (`instance stop` loops scoped to `apptest-<wtslug>-`). But note why the slug scoping could not be the whole story: it is structurally unable to reach a server leaked by a since-deleted worktree, which is how the 20-hour orphan survived.

  Historical note worth keeping, because it is the shape of a whole class of mistake: the *empty* tmux-server reap used to be justified by "the gate guarantees no other app-test run is live during a sweep." That precondition was true while the only caller was the gated recipe. The sweep now also runs from tugcast startup, outside the gate — so the justification evaporated without the rule changing. An inherited rationale that quietly stops applying under a new call site is the most dangerous kind; the age floor is what carries the rule now, unconditionally at every call site.

### Resource lifecycle & reclamation

Isolation is only half the contract; the other half is that nothing *leaks*. The table above keys each resource to an identity — this one tracks who creates it, what reclaims it, and the residual risk. Every entry must have a definite reclaim path; "the OS cleans it up eventually" is only acceptable for kernel-owned resources (ports, fds) bounded by process lifetime.

| Resource | Owner / keyed on | Created | Reclaimed | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| tugcast HTTP port (dev 55300–399 / app-test 55400–499) | tugcast, hashed id + walk-on-collision | `TcpListener::bind` | OS on process exit | None — bounded to process |
| Vite port (dev 55200–299 / app-test 55500–599) | Swift, hashed id | `spawnViteServer` | `ProcessManager.stop()` → `terminate()` + wait | None |
| Notify socket `tugbank-notify-<token>.sock` | tugcast | `bind` at boot | `remove_file` on graceful shutdown (`tugcast/src/main.rs`); crash residue by `tugutil host sweep` (connect-probed, live-namespace and age gated) | Crash → stale file until the next sweep. `$TMPDIR` does **not** reap these — believing it did is how 9,833 accumulated |
| Control socket `tugcast-ctl-<token>.sock` | tugcast (path from Swift) | `bind` | ProcessManager unlink on close; crash residue by `tugutil host sweep` | Same as notify socket |
| **tmux server** `tug-<token>` (daemon — *outside* any process group) | tugcast (`-L`) | first `tmux` call in the terminal feed | app-test: self-reap on shutdown (`main.rs`, gated on `apptest-` id); dev/release: `tugutil host instance remove`/`prune` and `dash join`/`release` (`reap_instance_tmux`); `tugutil host sweep` at both ends of the recipe and at dev/release startup | Covered on every managed path; the sweep is registry-anchored rather than slug-scoped, so it reaches orphans a deleted worktree left behind |
| tmux session `cc-<id>` | terminal feed | `ensure_session` | dies with its server | Bounded to server |
| PTY master/slave + `tmux attach` child | terminal feed | `pty_process::open()` + `spawn(pts)` | split halves drop on cancel → SIGHUP detaches the attach child; else `kill(-pgid)` | Self-reaps via hangup + process group. Bounded to tugcast |
| tugcode / claude subprocess | agent_bridge | per session | tugcast `kill(0)` on exit / ProcessManager `kill(-pgid)` SIGTERM→SIGKILL | In tugcast's process group → reaped |
| Registry entry (`$TMPDIR/tug-instances.json`) | tugcast | `register` at boot | `unregister` on shutdown; dead entries pruned on next register/load | Self-healing |
| Gate port (`APPTEST_GATE_PORT`, 55600) | `tugutil host gate` holder | `TcpListener::bind` at invocation start | OS on process exit — including SIGKILL (`FD_CLOEXEC` keeps gated children from inheriting it) | None — bounded to process |
| Per-worktree app-test DerivedData (`Tug-apptest-<wtslug>`) | `just build-app` (forced identity) | first app-test build in a worktree | **nothing automatic** — `just clean-all`'s `Tug-*` glob, or manual `rm` | The known leak: a dash that ran app-test leaves a DerivedData tree behind after `dash join`/`release`. Disk, not correctness. Deliberately outside the janitor: it is build output, not runtime debris, and no probe or registry entry can say whether an Xcode build is mid-flight |
| Instance data dir (`instances/<id>/`) | tugcast | `write_bundle_path_marker` + tugbank/sessions/Logs at boot | harness `wrappedKill` → `instance remove --data-only`; app-test residue by `tugutil host sweep` (registry + marker + age gated); bundle-missing dirs by `tugutil host instance prune` | SIGKILL or a launch failure skips the harness path; the sweep is the backstop. Dev/release dirs with an intact bundle are never candidates |

The process tree is the backbone: tugcast calls `setpgid(0, 0)` at startup so it leads its own group, and **both** exit paths reap the whole group — tugcast's own `kill(0)` on graceful shutdown and ProcessManager's `kill(-pgid)` (SIGTERM, then SIGKILL after 200 ms) on app teardown. That single mechanism reclaims tugcode, claude, and the `tmux attach` child. Vite is reaped separately and explicitly (it is a child of the GUI app, not of tugcast's group). The one daemon that escapes the process group is the tmux *server* — which is exactly why it carries explicit reaping rather than relying on signal propagation.

**Identity-checked kills.** `tugutil host instance stop`, tugcast's `--force`, and the janitor's reparented-process sweep all confirm a PID is still the process they registered (command match / registry ownership) before signalling. A PID is recycled the instant its process dies, so signalling a stale registry PID blind once let an app-test teardown SIGKILL a live debug instance's child. Never signal a PID you cannot confirm is yours.

**Known limitations (bounded, recorded — not open leaks):**

- **Token collision.** `tug-<token>` and the sockets key on a 32-bit FNV hash of the id; two instances colliding would share a tmux server / sockets and break isolation. ~1 in 4 billion per pair — negligible for the handful of live instances, but the ceiling is real.
- **Out-of-band worktree deletion.** A worktree removed by hand (`git worktree remove`, `rm -rf`) instead of `dash join`/`release` or `instance remove` orphans its tmux server. This is now reclaimed automatically: `tugutil host sweep` runs at both ends of every app-test invocation and on every dev/release tugcast startup, so merely using Tug keeps the machine clean. `just reap` survives as the on-demand front end to the same code (`just reap` to diagnose, `just reap apply` to release) — it is no longer a hand-written shell janitor, and there is deliberately only one implementation, since two would drift. Orphaned data dirs whose *bundle* is gone still go through `tugutil host instance prune`, which can delete a (possibly shared) app bundle and so must be run on purpose.
- **`--force` is vestigial for app-test.** Each launch mints a fresh `apptest-<wtslug>-<uuid>`, so there is never a same-id zombie to reclaim and `force_kill_port_holder` early-returns. Harmless; the flag could be dropped from the app-test launch.

## Smoke vs. scenario classification

Two test categories live under `tests/app-test/`:

### `harness-smoke/<name>.test.ts` — primitive gates

Smoke tests pin a single harness primitive: RPC handshake, evalJS error translation, native CGEvent click round-trip, app-reload, cold-boot / `quitGracefully`, capture-phase save invariant. They exist so a primitive regression can be diagnosed without the attribution being conflated with a scenario regression. If `smoke.test.ts` fails, the bridge transport is broken; if `at0001-tab-switch-fc.test.ts` fails *and* `smoke.test.ts` passes, the bug is in the scenario path, not the harness.

Smoke tests are not numbered. The filename describes what the gate asserts. Add a smoke test only when (a) it pins a harness primitive that AT scenarios depend on, AND (b) failure attribution would be muddled without a separate gate. A smoke test for behavior already covered by a scenario adds noise without diagnostic value.

### `at{NNNN}-<slug>.test.ts` — AT-numbered scenarios

Every AT-numbered file gates a regression case enumerated in [app-test-inventory.md](app-test-inventory.md). The `at{NNNN}` prefix MUST match an inventory entry. The AT-tag is the durable identifier; the slug after it can be re-edited as the test's framing evolves. To add a new scenario, add the inventory entry first (next-available `AT{NNNN}` is tracked at the top of the inventory), then write the test. The order matters because the inventory entry is the spec the test is gating; writing the test first invites the test to drift away from the case the inventory was supposed to cover.

The inventory-vs-test relationship is the durable one. Filenames change when the slug stops matching the framing; AT-tags do not. The reverse mapping (inventory entry → which test file gates it) is provided by the AT-tag prefix; the forward mapping (test file → which inventory entry it gates) is in the test's `describe` block as a natural-language reference and in the file header as a comment.
