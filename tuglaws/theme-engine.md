# Theme System (CSS-First)

## Source Of Truth

Theme data lives in checked-in CSS files:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `tugdeck/styles/themes/<name>.css` | Theme source (complete token declarations) |
| `tugdeck/styles/tug-active-theme.css` | Active theme copy (complete theme, never empty) |

Shipped themes (registered in `SHIPPED_THEME_NAMES`, `tugdeck/src/action-dispatch.ts`):

Each theme carries a **Key + Accent duet** ([`color-refactor`](../roadmap/archive/color-refactor.md)):
**Key** is the selection / primary-action hue (list & menu selection, toggle/radio/checkbox/choice
"on", tabs, links, the primary CTA, text selection); **Accent** is the affordance hue (keyboard caret
bar, focus ring, drag-drop stroke, flash). The chroma column notes each axis's relative saturation —
low-chroma Keys read as pale tints, high-chroma Keys as vivid.

| Theme | Mode | Tint | Key (chroma) | Accent (chroma) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `brio` | dark | indigo-violet | cobalt (vivid) | orange (vivid) |
| `nocturne` | dark | cobalt | sapphire (vivid) | tangerine (vivid) |
| `bravura` | dark | plum | cerise (pale rose) | aqua (vivid) |
| `harmony` | light | indigo | cobalt (vivid) | orange (vivid) |
| `aria` | light | rose | purple (muted) | sky (vivid) |
| `vivace` | light | teal | seafoam (pale) | fuchsia (vivid) |

Every theme is a peer — none depends on another at runtime. `brio` is special only as
`BASE_THEME_NAME` (the bundled base; see `tugdeck/src/theme-constants.ts`). Each theme is a
complete, hand-authored CSS file defining the full token vocabulary.

## Tinted-Neutral Authoring Doctrine

Every theme is **one tint hue over a shared lightness skeleton** — the "predominant tint colors the
details without a redesign" model. The engine (`--tug-color(hue, l:, c:)`, OKLCH) makes a new theme
largely a hue swap: keep the *lightness* ladder, change the *hue*.

1. **One tint hue per theme** for all `--tug7-surface-global-primary-*` neutrals (and the neutral
   text/icon/border/divider families). Surfaces differ by **lightness only**; chroma stays in a tight
   low band (a faint tint, c ≈ 0–2 in hundredths). Lightness carries elevation, not hue.
2. **Monotonic elevation ladder.** Dark: deeper base, lighter raised/overlay. Light: lighter base
   (content/raised/overlay near white), darker recessed wells (sunken). No hue jumps, no
   dark-surface-in-a-light-theme surprises. `screen` (tooltips, dev panel) is the lone exception in
   light themes — it stays light because tooltips render *default* text, not inverse.
3. **Signals are fixed across themes** by hue: `danger`=red, `success`=green, `caution`=yellow/gold,
   `data`=teal, `agent`=violet. The **selection / primary-action axis is no longer a fixed blue** —
   each theme picks its own **Key** hue (the `selection`/`active`/`toggle-on`/`link`/filled-action
   tokens) and a partnered **Accent** hue (the affordance axis: caret, focus ring, drag-drop, flash).
   Both ride the TugColor model (`--tug-color(hue, l:, c:)`, lightness kept per-mode so light themes keep
   their darker legible links); each rung carries its own chroma. Re-hue a theme with
   `tugdeck/scripts/apply-theme-editor.ts` (additive l/c deltas) from a clean theme file, then run the contrast audit.
   Keep Key and Accent ≥~30° from every signal hue and from each other; on-fill contrast text stays a
   near-white (dark) / near-black (light) neutral — never the Key hue, or it vanishes on its own fill.
4. **Signal tuning is per-mode.** Dark: bright, mid-tone, saturated. Light: darker and more saturated
   so a mark holds contrast on near-white. Saturated light hues (orange/yellow/teal) can't reach 3:1
   on white without turning muddy — that is an accepted light-theme tension, the mirror of dark
   themes' dark-on-dark limits.
5. **Consistent authoring style** (uniform `l:`/`c:` usage) so themes diff cleanly and the next tint
   swap stays mechanical.

A new theme: copy the same-mode reference (brio for dark, harmony for light), remap the neutral-tint
family and the accent hue, set a literal-hex `--tugx-host-canvas-color` matching the app surface, and
validate with the contrast audit below.

## Contrast Audit (per theme)

`bun run audit:theme-contrast` (`tugdeck/scripts/audit-theme-contrast.ts`) resolves every token in
the authoritative pairing map for each `styles/themes/*.css` and runs the same WCAG / perceptual /
CVD checks as the in-app Theme Accessibility card — headlessly, reusing `resolveTugColorToOklch`
(the single source of truth shared with `postcss-tug-color`, so build and audit never drift).

WCAG is normative per role; perceptual is informational. The gate is **comparative**: the base theme
(`brio`) sets the accessibility budget, and no other theme may ship with *more* WCAG failures than
it. Run `audit:theme-contrast <name>` for one theme (with the full failure list), or `--list` for all.

## Activation Model

### Development

- `POST /__themes/activate` is the activation API.
- `brio` copies `styles/themes/brio.css` into `tug-active-theme.css`.
- `harmony` copies `styles/themes/harmony.css` into `tug-active-theme.css`.
- The endpoint returns `{ theme, hostCanvasColor }`.
- `tug-active-theme.css` is always a complete theme; it is never empty.

### Production

- Base theme is included by app CSS import.
- Non-base theme is activated via `<link id="tug-theme-override" href="/assets/themes/<name>.css">`.
- `activateProductionTheme()` inserts/updates/removes that link.
- On startup, if saved theme is non-`brio`, the link is applied before first visible paint.

---

## Host Canvas Color Contract

Each theme CSS file must define:

```css
body {
  --tugx-host-canvas-color: #rrggbb;
}
```

Rules:

- Must be literal 6-digit hex.
- Dev activation returns this value from source CSS metadata.
- Production activation reads the applied CSS value and normalizes to `#rrggbb`.
- Swift bridge receives only the normalized hex string.

## Accessibility Card Data Path

Theme Accessibility uses live CSS, not derivation:

1. Build-time token inventory: `TUG_TOKEN_NAMES`.
2. Runtime raw values: `getComputedStyle(...).getPropertyValue(name)`.
3. Runtime color resolution: hidden probe element for tokens needing computed color.
4. Contrast/CVD analysis from resolved runtime colors.

This card reports live findings only (failures, marginals, unresolved values, CVD warnings).

---

## Build Processing

PostCSS is used for CSS processing:

- Authoring syntax `--tug-color(...)` remains in source CSS.
- `postcss-tug-color` expands to regular CSS during Vite dev/build.

The system intentionally duplicates one value per theme (`--tugx-host-canvas-color`) to keep runtime simple and explicit.
