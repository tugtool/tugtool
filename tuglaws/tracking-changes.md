# Tracking Changes

*How a session's file changes are captured, classified, and committed. The two-layer doctrine: **capture annotates, git status decides** — the attribution ledger records who changed what at the moment of change (best-effort by construction), and the read/commit side treats the working tree as the universe so a capture gap can narrow *attribution* but can never hide a file or shrink a commit.*

*Cross-references: `[D##]` → [design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md), principally [D112] (point-of-change attribution, provenance-only capture, per-file contention, row liveness) and [D113] (the aggregate changeset feed). Plan lineage: `roadmap/changesets-plan.md` (capture), `roadmap/commit-tool-fixes.md` (the join inversion, buckets, and refusal contract).*

---

## Why two layers

Two real incidents shaped this design: a `perl -i` bulk pass and a `git mv` sweep each left dozens of changed files with no attribution rows, and the commit tool of the day — which computed its file set as *ledger ∩ git status* — silently committed only the files it knew about. The root cause was architectural, not a bug: **capture is inherently best-effort** (a fingerprint delta cannot be reconstructed after the fact), so any reader that treats the ledger as a gate converts every capture miss into a silent omission.

The resolution is a strict division of labor:

| Layer | Owner | Question it answers | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Capture** | tugcast (`feeds/agent_bridge.rs`, `feeds/attribution.rs`) | *Who* changed this file, *how*? | Advisory — annotates, never gates |
| **Read / commit** | tugchanges-core (+ `tugutil` CLI) | *What* is dirty, and what gets committed? | `git status --untracked-files=all` is the universe |

The invariant that falls out ([D112], `commit-tool-fixes` [P01]): **a dirty file is never invisible.** Every dirty path appears in `tugutil preflight` in exactly one bucket; a default `tugutil commit` either accounts for every one of them or refuses. Capture hardening (brackets, `-uall`, the turn fallback) improves attribution *quality*; it is never load-bearing for commit *correctness*.

---

## The five identities (soundness axioms)

Classifying a dirty file consumes exactly five identities, and each must be derived **from the artifact itself, never from ambient context**. Every historical attribution failure was one of these resolved ambiently; the list is closed, so a new failure class would have to violate one of these axioms — check here first.

| Identity | Axiom | Derived from | Ambient shortcut it forbids (and the incident it caused) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Who** (session) | A row's session is the relay that recorded it | `$TUG_SESSION_ID` at the recording relay | — (never broken; capture is relay-local by construction) |
| **What** (evidence) | Only **proof** decides ownership — for *any* session, including the recording one. Correlation may only *suggest* | The tool frame: `exact`/`replay`/`claim`/`cmd` name the file in the tool input (proof); `bash`/`turn` are a whole-tree fingerprint delta (correlation) | "any row = authorship" — bracket sweeps claimed other sessions' saves (meek-sheep), and self-brackets claimed the user's own hand-saves |
| **Where** (repo + path) | Repo membership is a **per-file** fact: the row's repo root is resolved by walking up from the file's own directory (worktree-aware), and the path is stored relative to *that* root | The file's own path at capture time (`file_repo_root`) | projecting against the *session's* project dir — a dash session's worktree files were keyed `.tug/worktrees/…` under the main checkout, invisible to every reader |
| **When** (liveness) | A claim lives only until its path's next commit; the commit spends it | The path's own git history (`git log -1 --format=%ct`) | immortal rows — any re-dirty resurrected every fossil claim (G6) |
| **Scope** (which ledger) | One machine-global ledger; the working tree is machine-global so the truth about it must be too | `changes.db` under the shared data dir, keyed by canonical repo root | per-instance ledgers — a second app instance saw the first's work as ownerless (fluent-light) |

The evidence axiom deserves its one-sentence justification, because it is the one that keeps getting re-litigated: a bracket delta contains **every path whose status/mtime moved during the window** — another session's save, a build's churn, and the **user's own editor save**, which belongs to no session and can never be claimed back. Evidence too weak to attribute a file to someone else is exactly as weak when it points at yourself.

---

## The ledger

The record is the `file_events` table in the **machine-global `changes.db`** (`~/Library/Application Support/Tug/changes.db`), one row per (session, tool call, file). One ledger for the whole machine, regardless of app instance: the working tree is machine-global, so per-instance attribution splits the truth — a second instance on the same checkout would see the first instance's work as ownerless. The rows themselves are keyed by canonical repo root (`project_dir`), so every instance's compose and every `tugutil` invocation reads the same answer.

- **Location:** `tugcore::instance::changes_db_path()` — deliberately independent of `TUG_INSTANCE_ID`; the `TUG_CHANGES_DB` env override exists solely for test isolation (the app-test harness and CLI suites point it at scratch files). Each instance's `SessionLedger` opens its own per-instance `sessions.db` and `ATTACH`es the shared `changes.db` as schema `changes`; on first open it migrates any legacy per-instance `file_events` rows in and drops the legacy table.
- **Writer:** tugcast only (`session_ledger.rs` owns the DDL; the relay loop writes rows). Multiple tugcast processes write concurrently — WAL + busy-timeout make that safe. Every write is best-effort — a ledger error is logged and the wire frame forwards unchanged; attribution never gates delivery ([D112]). Evicting a `sessions` row deletes its `changes.file_events` rows explicitly (a trigger cannot reach across databases).
- **Reader:** tugchanges-core opens `changes.db` **read-only** (`SQLITE_OPEN_READ_ONLY`, WAL-safe against the concurrent writers) for `file_events`, plus the per-instance `sessions.db` for the known-session test — a session with rows in the shared ledger is known even when this instance holds no `sessions` row for it. Raw-SQL coupling (`tugchanges-core/src/ledger.rs`; a contract test guards the shape).
- **Idempotency contract:** the primary key is `(tug_session_id, tool_use_id, file_path)` with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Replay/resume re-streams history freely and converges; every capture source must mint `tool_use_id`s that respect this key (the turn bracket's synthetic `turn:<opened_at_millis>` id exists for exactly this reason).
- **Path space:** `file_path` is stored **repo-relative in canonical space**, and `project_dir` is the **file's own repo root** — resolved per file at capture time by walking up from the file's directory (`attribution.rs::file_repo_root`, worktree-aware: a `.git` *file* marks a linked worktree's root). A session whose project dir is one checkout can exact-edit files in a nested dash worktree; those rows are keyed by the worktree's root with worktree-relative paths, so a read inside the worktree matches them. A file in **no repo at all** is measured against the session's repo, falls outside it, and is **not recorded** — `file_events` holds only paths a changeset can show. (The fold matches events against git's repo-relative dirty paths, so an out-of-repo row could never surface in a bucket, a claim, or a draft; the session's own writes outside the checkout — memory files under `~/.claude/…` are the everyday case — remain in the session JSONL, which is the full activity record.) Legacy rows (absolute paths, or worktree files misfiled under the outer checkout) degrade safely: they stop matching and the file surfaces as `unattributed` — visible, never silent.
- **Provenance only:** a row records who/what/when/how (`tug_session_id`, `tool_use_id`, `file_path`, `tool_name`, `op`, `origin`, `at`) and **no judgments**. The schema's `ambiguous` column is legacy — always written 0, read by nothing (which also neutralizes every historical row the retired time-overlap heuristic poisoned; see Contention below).

---

## Capture: the origins

All capture happens at one supervised point — tugcast's stdout relay loop (`agent_bridge.rs::relay_session_io`), which every tool frame already traverses. The source rules are distinguished by the row's `origin` and split into two **evidence classes** (the What axiom, `origin_is_proof`): `exact`/`replay`/`claim`/`cmd` are **proof** (the tool input names the file), `bash`/`turn` are **correlation** (a whole-tree delta; at read time it can only *hint*, never decide):

| `origin` | Class | `tool_name` | Mechanism | When |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `exact` | proof | `Write`/`Edit`/`MultiEdit`/`NotebookEdit` | Path read straight from the tool input | Recorded on the **successful** `tool_result` (a denied/errored call records nothing) |
| `bash` | correlation | `Bash` | Per-call working-tree fingerprint bracket | Snapshot on `tool_use`, delta on `tool_result` |
| `turn` | correlation | `Turn` | Turn-scoped fallback bracket | Snapshot on the `user_message` forward, delta on the turn's non-replayed `turn_complete` |
| `replay` | proof | (as original) | Exact-tool backfill during JSONL replay | Historical `timestamp` used as `at`; PK collapses re-streams |
| `claim` | proof | `Claim` | A session explicitly claims paths (`tugutil changes claim` → `changeset_claim`) | On the claim request |
| `cmd` | proof | `Bash` | The Bash command **literally names** the file (parsed operands) or a `tugutil file` receipt reports it | Live: parsed operands ∩ the bracket delta. Replay: parsed operands on a successful result. Receipt: any successful result whose output carries one |

### Exact tools

The relay holds a `PendingCalls` map (size-capped, oldest-evicted, **not** cleared on `turn_complete` — a background agent's child `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair can straddle a turn boundary). Populated at `tool_use` time, consumed at `tool_result` time; only a successful result records.

### The Bash bracket

Bash is the one opaque mutator, so it is bracketed: on the Bash `tool_use` the relay snapshots the working tree (`snapshot_worktree`: `git status --porcelain=v2 --untracked-files=all`, plus mtime per listed path — status catches category changes, mtime catches a same-status re-write), and on the `tool_result` it snapshots again and attributes the delta (`OpenBracket::into_delta_rows`). The delta is attributed regardless of the result's `is_error` — a failing command can have mutated files before it failed.

A path that was dirty pre-command and absent from the post-snapshot is disambiguated **by disk existence**, not by assumption: still on disk → `modified` (the command committed or reverted it); gone → `deleted`. Deleting an *untracked* file removes it from the dirty set entirely — it never earns a ` D` status — so without the existence check the row would read `modified` about a file that no longer exists.

### Parsed commands — the `cmd` origin

A bracket delta is correlation because it is a whole-tree fingerprint: it cannot tell this session's write from a build's churn or the user's hand-save. But a Bash command that says `rm src/a.ts` **names its file in the tool input**, exactly as `Write`'s `file_path` does — the same epistemic standing, with none of the bracket's contamination. So the relay parses Bash commands through one conservative grammar (`tugchanges-core::shell_ops`) and mints proof-class `cmd` rows for what the command literally declares.

The grammar reads only what it can read with certainty. It tokenizes quote-aware (so a `git mv` mentioned inside a commit message never matches), strips heredoc bodies, splits on `&&`/`||`/`;`/`|`, applies a leading literal `cd`, and recognizes `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `git rm`, `git mv`, `git restore`, `git checkout --`, the in-place editors `sed -i`/`perl -i`/`ruby -i`, `tee`, `touch`, and redirection targets. **Any operand carrying a variable, a substitution, a glob, or a brace expansion refuses the whole simple command** — refusal costs nothing (the path degrades to exactly today's bracket hint), a wrong proof row costs everything.

The three in-place editors share one flag scan (`in_place_editor_ops`) so they cannot drift, and refusal there is uniform: when in-place editing is on and any file operand is non-literal, the whole command refuses. `perl` and `ruby` cluster their switches, so the scan reads `-i` as swallowing the rest of its cluster as the backup suffix (`-i.bak`, `-pi`, `-0pi` all read the same) and `-e`/`-E` as taking the program either attached or as the next word — the same shape as `sed`'s `-e`/`-f`, and the reason a flag argument is never mistaken for a filename.

Two mint rules, because the two paths have different evidence available:

- **Live: parse ∩ delta.** The parse invents no rows — it *upgrades* the origin of bracket-delta rows whose path the command literally named (`bash` → `cmd`). The parse supplies per-file naming, the delta supplies observed outcome; neither alone is proof. A declared path matches a delta path **equal to it or beneath it**, which is what lets a recursive `rm -r dir/` elevate the per-file rows the `-uall` status expands it into. Declared paths pass through the `CanonicalPath` gateway before the join, or an alt spelling of the repo root would silently miss.
- **Replay: parse + success.** No fingerprint survives a restart, but the command text replays. A replayed Bash `tool_use` whose paired `tool_result` succeeded mints `cmd` rows directly at the frames' historical timestamps. This is the first capture path that recovers shell mutations from history — it heals the thick head of G1.

**Renames record two rows** under one `tool_use_id` — the new path and the old path, both `op='renamed'`. The old-path row documents the takeoff point, which the delta alone can never supply (a clean file that gets moved simply leaves the dirty set under its old name).

### Verb receipts

Globs and shell variables are unreadable by construction — but a tool we own can testify to its own outcome. The `tugutil file rm|mv|cp|edit` verbs perform the expansion or the edit themselves and print one stdout line naming exactly what happened:

```
TUG-FILE-RECEIPT: {"ops":[{"op":"deleted","path":"/abs/a.ts"},{"op":"renamed","path":"/abs/new.ts","orig_path":"/abs/old.ts"},{"op":"modified","path":"/abs/x.ts"}]}
```

`tugutil file edit` is the attributable form of the substitutions that would otherwise be written as an unreadable `perl -i` or a `python3` heredoc: `--patch` applies a unified diff, `--path/--replace/--with` does the single-substitution case, and either way the receipt names **only the files whose bytes actually moved** — a file the patch mentions but leaves identical is not in it, and a substitution that matches nothing exits non-zero with no receipt at all, because a silently-successful no-op edit is how a stale substitution hides.

The relay scans **every** successful Bash `tool_result` output for that sentinel and mints `cmd` rows for each op (a rename → two rows, per above). Receipt ops name **files, never directories** — the read side's universe is per-file, so a directory op could never join; a recursive verb enumerates the affected files before acting. Forgery is a non-risk: rows are relay-local (the Who axiom), so a session echoing the sentinel can only attribute files to *itself* — the same trust class as calling the verb.

**A probe deliberately records nothing.** `tugutil file probe --patch p.diff -- <cmd>` is the patch → run → revert cycle as one verb, and it emits **no** receipt: it restores the original bytes *and* the original mtime, so it changed nothing and a row saying otherwise would be a lie in the ledger. That mtime restore is load-bearing rather than cosmetic — `snapshot_worktree` fingerprints status **and** mtime, so a restored-but-touched file would still mint a bracket hint. Routing a probe through the verb therefore *removes* a class of false `bash` hints that doing the same thing by hand creates. It also snapshots to a temp directory rather than reverting through git, because `git checkout --` would destroy any uncommitted work already on those paths and cannot restore an untracked file at all.

**The protected set is a deliberate superset, and asking git is not optional.** What the probe snapshots is the union of `git apply --numstat` — git's own answer to what the patch touches — and the diff's `---`/`+++`/`rename from`/`copy from` headers. Neither source alone is complete: an entry with no hunks at all (a 100%-similarity rename, a mode-only change) is invisible to a header scan, while `--numstat` reports a rename's *destination* but not its source, which is exactly the file that disappears. A header-only scan shipped first and had precisely this hole — a patch mixing one hunked file with a pure rename cleared the "names no files" guard on the hunked file's strength, so the rename applied and was never undone, and the probe exited **0** on a tree it had permanently modified. The asymmetry is the whole argument for over-collecting: a missed path is an unrestored file the user is never told about, an extra path is one temp-file copy.

**The gate denies only the unparseable.** A tugplug PreToolUse hook (`tugplug/hooks/gate-file-ops.sh`) asks the same grammar, through `tugutil file gate`, whether a Bash command contains a file-mutating operation with non-literal operands — an rm/mv-class lifecycle op, or an in-place editor rewriting contents — and denies only that, steering to the verb that covers it. Which verb that is rides on the refusal itself (`ParseOutcome::Unparseable`'s `Suggestion`), because the grammar is the only thing that knows what refused: an unreadable `perl -i` is steered at `tugutil file edit`, not at `rm|mv|cp`. A `python3` heredoc is never denied — it cannot be judged without parsing Python, and most of them are read-only analysis — so that residue is steered by `CLAUDE.md` alone. Literal commands pass untouched because the parser already proves them; everything else falls through to the normal permission flow. Friction lands exactly where correlation would otherwise have been the ceiling, and the gate fails **open** (missing binary or unreadable output → allow).

### The turn-scoped fallback bracket

The per-call Bash bracket has structural holes (G2/G3 below), so the relay also brackets the **whole turn**: pre-snapshot when a `user_message` is forwarded to tugcode stdin (seconds before the model can emit any command), post-snapshot on that turn's non-replayed `turn_complete`. Any delta path not already covered by an exact or per-call row this turn (tracked in a relay-local `turn_recorded_paths` set) becomes an `origin='turn'` row. A path an exact or Bash row already recorded this turn gets no turn row; replay never opens a turn bracket (user messages don't replay through `input_rx`, and a replayed `turn_complete` closes nothing).

### Capture is a private, per-session affair

**Every bracket is relay-local.** There is no cross-session bracket registry: a relay's Bash brackets live in a per-relay map beside its turn bracket, a crashed relay simply drops them (no sweep ceremony — the read side's bucket surfacing covers the residual gap), and no capture path can observe, mark, or be marked by another session. A bracket delta is a *claim* of authorship, not a proof; competing claims are resolved where they can actually be seen — per file, at read time (Contention, below).

### Replay

On resume/restore, exact tool frames re-stream from JSONL and backfill rows with `origin='replay'` at their historical timestamps. Bash *deltas* are **never** reconstructed at replay — the pre-command fingerprint no longer exists (G1) — but a Bash command's *text* does replay, so the parse-and-receipt paths above backfill `cmd` rows for what those commands declared. What remains unreconstructable is the opaque residue (inline scripts, builds), and the read side makes that harmless as before.

Two transport facts keep the backfill honest (both learned from the 07-25 blackout, G7/G8): replayed frames travel **batched** — tugcode flushes committed-turn content as `replay_batch` wire lines of up to 256 inner frames — and the relay unwraps the envelope and runs the same exact intercept per inner frame, so attribution sees every frame the deck does. And the `replay_started`/`replay_complete` bracket is **guaranteed to close**: tugcode emits the close on every exit including the exception path (`error.kind = "replay_exception"`), and the relay backstops it with a 120 s watchdog that forces live capture back on and warns — a latched `in_replay` suppresses Bash and turn capture, so an open bracket is a standing outage, never left to one process's good behavior.

---

## Contention, authorship, and row liveness

Three read-time rules turn raw provenance rows into trustworthy classification. All are computed per file, from evidence; capture contributes facts only.

**Authorship — proof decides; correlation only suggests. For every session, including the recording one.** A proof row's file comes straight from the tool input: the session provably edited that file. A `bash`/`turn` row is a whole-tree fingerprint *delta* — every path whose status/mtime moved during the command/turn window — and it **cannot distinguish this session's own writes from another session's concurrent save, a build's churn, or the user's own hand-save in their editor** (which belongs to no session at all and can never be claimed back). So a bracket row never establishes ownership — not across sessions (the meek-sheep contamination: with two sessions live on one checkout, each session's `cargo`/`git`/`just` bracket swept up the other's saves and everything went `shared`) and **not for its own session either** (the user saves a file by hand while the agent's `cargo build` runs → the bracket sweeps it into the agent's claim → a default commit takes the user's inflight work). A self bracket row survives as a **hint**: the file stays `unattributed`, tagged `likely this session's (bash bracket)`, and inclusion is the same explicit disposition as any other unattributed file — one flag, informed by the hint, never automatic. Concretely, per dirty path, over live rows:

- This session has a live proof row → **attributed** (op/origin from the latest proof row); `shared` iff another session also has a live proof row.
- No self proof row, another session has a live proof row → **foreign** (theirs); this session's bracket rows are ignored as contamination.
- No proof owner anywhere → **unattributed**, always. A live self bracket row annotates the entry with its op/origin as the hint; other sessions' bracket rows annotate nothing (never falsely foreign).

**Contention (`shared`).** A file is `shared` if and only if **two or more sessions hold live proof rows for that exact repo-relative path** on the same repo. This is the *only* cross-session signal, and (per authorship, above) bracket rows are excluded from it. Wall-clock overlap between sessions is never evidence: the retired design cross-marked rows `ambiguous` whenever two sessions' Bash brackets were open on the same repo root at the same moment, which false-positived on every unrelated concurrent command while adding nothing real. Shared files are excluded from every default commit set (the card's one-click commit and `tugutil commit` alike) and included only by explicit election (`--all`, `--tree`, `--paths`); the claimant sessions are named alongside the flag. (Accepted gap: two sessions genuinely editing one file *only* via Bash — no proof row on either side — is not flagged `shared`; both see the same hinted-unattributed file, and the failure direction is under-report, never a false claim.)

**Row liveness.** A ledger row is **live** only while it postdates the last commit that touched its path; a commit *spends* the rows it absorbs. Concretely (`min_live_at_ms`, implemented identically in tugchanges-core `changes.rs` and tugcast `changeset.rs`): a row is live iff `at ≥ (last_commit_epoch_secs + 1) × 1000`, the whole commit second treated as spent so ties break toward spent; a path with no commit history (new/untracked) spends nothing — every row is live. Spent rows neither attribute nor contend: without this rule rows are immortal, so the moment a path went dirty again — days later, by anyone — every historical row resurfaced and re-claimed it (G6). The degradation direction is always toward `unattributed`: visible, never falsely claimed.

The cost profile: liveness needs one `git log -1 --format=%ct -- <path>` per dirty path *that has rows at all* (a cheap SQL probe runs first), bounded by the dirty set.

## The capture-gap inventory

The known ways attribution can be missing or wrong — and why each is safe now:

| Gap | What happens | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **G1 — replay never brackets Bash** | Historical Bash deltas are unreconstructable after restart/reload | Narrowed by the `cmd` backfill: a replayed command's *declared* operands and verb receipts mint proof rows at historical timestamps. The opaque residue (inline scripts, builds) stays unreconstructable and surfaces as `unattributed` |
| **G2 — pre-snapshot races a fast command** | Claude Code executes Bash regardless of the relay; a fast `perl -i` can finish before the pre-snapshot's `git status` returns → pre == post, zero rows | Caught by the **turn bracket** (its pre-snapshot precedes the whole turn) — as a *hint* on the unattributed entry, per the evidence axiom |
| **G3 — relay crash mid-Bash** | The open bracket is dropped with the relay | Mid-Bash within a live turn: turn-bracket hint. Mid-turn crash: `unattributed`, unhinted |
| **G4 — shell route (`$` commands)** | Shell commands never traverse the relay's tool frames ([D111]) | Deliberately uncaptured; visible as `unattributed` |
| **G5 — untracked-directory collapse** | Plain porcelain collapses a fully-untracked dir to one `? dir/` line, so files inside never matched any join | Fixed outright: **both** status universes (`snapshot_worktree` and tugchanges-core's `status_output`) pass `--untracked-files=all` |
| **G6 — row immortality** | Rows outlive the commit that consumed them; a re-dirtied path resurrected every fossil claim on it | Fixed at read time by the **row-liveness rule** — spent rows neither attribute nor contend |
| **G7 — batched replay frames invisible** | tugcode flushes replay content as `replay_batch` lines (≤256 inner frames); the line-oriented intercept matched the `tool_use` substring, failed the flat parse, and skipped **silently** — replay backfill recorded nothing, ever, and live frames a mid-turn replay swallowed into its bracket vanished with it (the 07-25 blackout's healing layer was itself broken) | Fixed outright: the relay unwraps the envelope and runs the exact intercept per inner frame (`origin='replay'`, historical `at`, PK collapses re-streams); a genuine tool frame that fails both inspected parses now **warns** (shape drift is loud) |
| **G8 — lost `replay_complete` latches `in_replay`** | An exception in tugcode's replay loop after `replay_started` skipped the bracket close; the relay then held `in_replay` for its remaining life — no Bash brackets, no turn-bracket close (zero `turn` rows forever), frozen `turn_count` — with no diagnostic (the 07-25 blackout's latch) | Fixed on both sides: tugcode's bracket close is exception-proof (the throw path emits `replay_complete` with `error.kind="replay_exception"`; the in-flight snapshot is fenced separately); the relay adds a 120 s watchdog that forces live capture back on and warns, and a live `turn_complete` inside a replay bracket warns |
| **G9 — stdout drain death** | One synchronous throw from a frame handler escaped tugcode's unguarded drain loop; every subsequent claude line was lost while the process stayed alive — the full-session "wedge", which also blinds every capture layer at once | Fixed: a per-line throw barrier (`stdout_drain.line_exception`) logs and continues — one bad line loses that line only |

The pattern: G5/G6 were read-side defects, G7–G9 transport defects, and all are fixed; G2/G3 are narrowed by the turn bracket; G1/G4 and every future unknown gap are rendered harmless by the bucket surfacing. No gap can produce a silent half-commit, and no gap's residue can falsely claim a file.

**The 07-25 blackout (incident record).** For ~3h40m (2026-07-25 17:20–21:00Z) the release instance wrote zero `file_events` machine-wide while sessions demonstrably edited (the JSONLs held the `Edit` calls; mtimes matched to the second), relays forwarded frames, and the same SQLite connection kept writing `sessions.db` — G7+G8 compounding: mid-turn deck reloads routed live tool frames through replay brackets the intercept couldn't read, a lost bracket-close latched `in_replay`, and the backfill that should have healed it on the next resume was itself G7-blind. Two diagnostic lessons are law now: **capture failure must be loud** (every layer that goes dark warns — see invariant 12), and a resolver log line at an incident edge is not a mechanism (`PathResolver alt_count` dropping 2→0 was the input spelling changing to the already-canonical form, not the canonical-path machinery "losing" anything — it isn't even on the attribution write path, which goes through the `CanonicalPath` gateway).

## The read side: three buckets

`tugchanges-core` (`changes.rs::resolve_changes`) enumerates `git status --porcelain=v2 --untracked-files=all` as the universe and classifies **every dirty path** into exactly one bucket, using **live rows only**:

| Bucket | Meaning | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `files` (attributed) | This session has live **proof** rows for the path | `Change` — `{path, op, origin, shared, sessions, git_status, diff}`; latest live *proof* row wins op/origin; `shared` + claimant `sessions` when other sessions also hold live proof rows |
| `foreign` | Only *other* sessions hold live proof rows, and their `project_dir` canonicalizes to this repo root | `ForeignChange` — `{path, git_status, sessions[], diff}` |
| `unattributed` | No live proof rows anywhere (including all-claims-spent) | `Change` — sentinel `op:"unknown"`, `origin:"none"`, except when this session's own live bracket row hints (op/origin carried through, e.g. `modified`/`bash`; the plain read-out renders `likely this session's (bash bracket)`) |

**A rename carries its attribution across the move.** For a dirty path git reports as renamed, the classification also looks up rows under the entry's `orig_path` (straight from `git status --porcelain=v2`, which already knows the old name) — each name's rows filtered by **its own** liveness cut. Without this, `git mv A B` severed a file's entire history: every proof row earned under `A` was stranded and `B` landed in `unattributed` with no owner. Lineage needs no ledger column and no migration — the uncommitted rename's old name comes from git itself, and once the rename commits, liveness spends both names' rows anyway. (A column would be actively unsafe: `changes.db` is machine-global with concurrent writers at potentially different binary versions, and the schema drift guard resolves drift by DROP-and-recreate, so each version would see the other's shape as drift and destroy the table in turn.) The join is deliberately **one hop** — git reports a single `orig_path` per uncommitted rename, so a second move inside one uncommitted window degrades to a bracket hint.

All three are diffed in `context` (an untracked file gets a synthesized add-diff via `git diff --no-index -- /dev/null <path>` — never an empty string). The per-path session query (`ledger.rs::sessions_for_path` / `foreign_sessions_for_path`: canonicalized repo match + the liveness cut) is advisory classification: a row that fails to match degrades to `unattributed`, visible either way.

Session resolution is unchanged and fires **before** bucketing: no session id / no ledger / unknown session exit **2**. A known session with zero attributed files and a dirty tree is *not* an error — it is empty `files` plus a populated `unattributed`.

The legacy `tugutil changes` verb keeps its event-scoped wire contract (attributed only); the buckets surface through `context`, the commit skill's single command.

## Commit: the disposition contract

`tugchanges_core::commit` implements the matrix (`commit-tool-fixes` Table T01), with precedence `--paths` > `--tree` > (`--include-unattributed` / `--leave-unattributed` / `--all`):

| Invocation | Commits | If unattributed files exist |
|---|---|---|
| (default) | attributed, non-shared | **refuses — exit 3, nothing committed** |
| `--leave-unattributed` | attributed, non-shared | proceeds; receipt `left_behind` names them |
| `--include-unattributed` | + unattributed | included |
| `--all` | + shared (composes with the two above) | per the flags above |
| `--tree` | attributed ∪ unattributed ∪ shared — everything but foreign | included |
| `--paths <p…>` | exactly the given paths; bypasses bucketing entirely | caller's call |

- **Exit codes:** 0 success · 1 real error · 2 session resolution · 3 refusal (`CommitError::UnattributedPresent`, typed — no string sniffing). The exit-3 stderr lists the offending paths *and* names the disposition flags, so the way out is always in the message.
- **`foreign` never blocks and is never auto-included** — only an explicit `--paths` can take another session's file.
- **Staging is by construction:** `git add -- <files>` then `git commit -m <msg> -- <files>` — never `git add .` — so the receipt cannot disagree with what was staged.
- **The receipt tells on itself:** after committing, the bucketing re-runs and `CommitReceipt.left_behind` (`{unattributed, foreign, shared}`) names every still-dirty path. A partial commit is visible in its own receipt, not two sessions later.

### Below the file: hunk election

A landing can take *part* of a file. `CommitOptions.hunks` (wire: `changeset_commit.hunks`, CLI: `tugutil commit --hunks`) maps a repo-relative path to the ids of the hunks to land; every key must also be in the file set, and a path with no entry lands whole — which is what every landing did before hunks existed.

**A hunk's id is a content hash of its body**, computed in `tugchanges_core::hunks` and nowhere else, then served to the deck alongside the diff text. The `@@` header is excluded, so an unrelated hunk changing size does not move this hunk's id, while any change to the hunk's own content does — which is exactly when a stale election must be refused (`CommitError::HunkDrift`, nothing staged, nothing committed). The deck never re-derives an id, so the checkbox, the draft election, and the commit filter cannot disagree. Two independent readers do run `git diff` — the async wire and the sync engine — and the flags they must share to keep producing the same ids are `tugchanges_core::hunks::HUNK_DIFF_FLAGS`, with the whole agreement contract stated in that module's doc.

**The elections ride the draft's selection as opaque JSON.** The selection column is free-form and the client is its only interpreter; Rust stores and serves it verbatim (`ChangesetDraft.selection` is a `serde_json::Value`). The wire projection must never narrow it to a struct — serde drops unknown fields, so a typed projection silently deletes any key it does not name, which is precisely how the hunk elections were written to the ledger and then dropped on the way back out.

**Partial staging changes the staging shape**, and the change is load-bearing:

- The index must start clean (a typed refusal names what is already staged). Partial staging commits the whole index, so pre-existing staged content would ride along in the receipt's blind spot.
- Whole-file paths stage with `git add --`; elected paths stage by rebuilding a unified diff of only their elected hunks (new-side offsets recomputed by cumulative delta over the *included* hunks) and piping it to `git apply --cached`.
- The commit then runs with **no pathspec**. `git commit -- <paths>` commits *working-tree* content for those paths, which would drag the unelected hunks in — the pathspec form is structurally incompatible with partial staging.
- Every filtered patch is built before anything is staged, so drift refuses without touching the index; any later failure resets the whole staged set, whole-file paths included, or our own residue would trip the next attempt's index-clean precondition.
- **Created files are whole-file only.** Their diff is synthesized from `git diff --no-index` rather than read out of the index, so no hunk of one is addressable; the engine refuses such an election and the card renders no controls on them.

**A partial commit spends the whole path's rows.** Liveness is per-path (`min_live_at_ms` above), so the un-landed remainder's evidence dies with the commit and the remainder surfaces as `unattributed` afterward. This is the doctrine's blessed failure direction — visible, never falsely claimed — and the remainder stays electable by hand. Re-minting rows for the remainder's owner at land time is a recorded follow-on, not built speculatively.

**Interactive staging is answered, not run.** `git add -p` and its relatives (`commit`/`stash`/`checkout`/`restore`/`reset` with `-p`/`--patch`/`--interactive`, and a bare `git commit` with no message flag) are detected at the `$` route's `exec` and answered with a steering notice. In the block shell a command's stdin is `/dev/null`, so those prompts read EOF and stage nothing while exiting 0 — a no-op that looks like success. The graphical surface is the answer: the Changes shade picks hunks, and `tugutil file stage --patch <file|->` is the non-interactive verb for a script or an agent. This is steering plus verbs, never a PTY ([D111] stands).

The net effect of refusal + `--tree` + `left_behind`: a half-commit is impossible to produce *by accident*. Every narrowing is an explicit, named election.

## The landing workflow

The workflow layer over the soundness axioms above ([D116]): every change lands through one lifecycle — **Preflight → Draft → Land** — in two lanes (main-lane commit, dash-lane join), one room (the Changes shade), one landing gesture (the prompt-entry verbs `/commit` and `/join`).

**The Draft is the unit of work.** The maintained draft — message + selection dispositions + edited-provenance — is durable and **machine-global** (`changes.changeset_drafts`, the same [D112] scope axiom as `file_events`: the working tree is machine-global, so the truth about its proposed landing must be too). It is editable in place in the shade's composer (a `TugMessageEditor` over the `TugTextEditor` substrate — the composer *is* the display; the message is never rendered read-only elsewhere), and its `fingerprint` detects drift: on mismatch the shade shows a "changes moved since this draft" marker, advisory only — the human is looking right at it.

**Edited drafts are never machine-clobbered.** Once a human (or a skill — a skill-authored draft is an authored draft) has touched the message, `edited=1` pins it: the draft engine and non-forced draft requests never overwrite it. The shade's explicit **Regenerate** — confirmed inline when the draft is edited — is the only overwrite path, and it resets the pin. Selection dispositions are the user's, not the scribe's: a regeneration replaces the message and carries the selection forward.

**Skills draft; humans land.** The `draft` skill gathers via plain `tugutil preflight`, decides dispositions per the hint doctrine, authors the message, and writes it with `tugutil draft set` — never commits. The `implement` skill ends by writing the dash's join draft. Landing is an act of the session's human: `/commit` (two-beat: no ready draft → open the shade and generate; ready draft → land it; an explicit message wins; `now` collapses the beats) and `/join <name>` (preview in memory, then squash-land with the join draft as the message; conflicts route into the shade's resolve flow; an empty dash routes to its release affordance).

**Landing gates are idle-only, enforced at the affordance.** Every landing requires the session idle (a turn in flight means files may still be moving under the selection), no pending round-trip for the same key, a non-empty selection (commit) or a clean-or-resolved preview (join), and a non-empty message. Refusals surface as pane bulletins, never silently; while non-idle, the shade's mutating controls render disabled with a reason. **Drafting stays live mid-turn** — reading diffs, flipping dispositions, and editing the message never wait; only the mutating verbs gate. Release is shade-only ([D116]): destruction requires walking to the room, and a dash with work shows the discard preflight (rounds + subjects + dirt) before the destructive confirm.

**Receipts are transcript ink.** A successful landing appends a non-context row to the session's transcript — verb, short sha, subject, counts; joins carry their dash provenance; releases name what was discarded. History badges join commits by the `Tug-Dash:` trailer already on the squash message.

**One verb owner; the CLI is the API.** Every button and skill path resolves to a `tugutil` verb or a tugcast CONTROL verb backed by the same core: `tugutil draft set|show|clear`, `tugutil commit`, `tugutil dash join`. Raw git remains read-only spelunking by written policy — ONLY THE USER LANDS.

**Which instance serves a draft write is not a decision.** `tugutil draft set|clear` POSTs `/api/draft` on a running tugcast rather than opening the ledger itself — one writer surface, one journal, one pragma set — but the row it writes lands in the machine-global `changes.db` and is funnelled to the single ledger writer whichever instance receives it. Every live instance therefore produces the same row, so a multi-instance registry is **not** an ambiguity error here: discovery picks one (skipping app-test throwaways, whose ledger is a tempdir that dies with the run) and `--instance`/`--port` remain as an override. Discovery also reaches through a dash worktree to the checkout its instance was built from, so a shell inside a dash is never instance-less. An instance-**directed** verb — `host tell`, `host ask`, anything that raises UI in one specific deck — keeps the strict rule, because there the wrong instance is the wrong answer. Whatever a command does when it can't resolve, it may only prescribe flags it actually declares: `draft set` once told users to pass an `--instance` it did not accept, which is how a working write looked like a broken one.

## Consumers

| Consumer | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tugutil preflight` / `commit` | tugchanges-core via the CLI (`tugutil/src/changes.rs`) | The bucket surface; JSON envelope fields are additive |
| The draft skill | `tugplug/skills/draft/SKILL.md` | Runs plain `tugutil preflight` (no `--json`, no jq/python/grep glue), must dispose of every `unattributed` file — the `likely this session's (bash bracket)` hint informs the election — and writes the landing draft via `tugutil draft set`; it never commits |
| Session card commit button | `tugcast feeds/changeset.rs::run_changeset_commit` | Calls `commit()` with an explicit `paths` set → bypasses bucketing, can never hit the refusal; maps `CommitError` back to its `String` error |
| Changeset card / feed | `feeds/changeset.rs`, `feeds/changeset_all.rs` ([D113]) | Composes live ledger rows per project (same liveness rule); marks per-file multi-owner paths `shared`; the card's default selection is `!shared` for session files and **OFF for unattributed** (inclusion is an explicit per-file election — the card mirror of the exit-3 refusal) |
| `tugutil file rm\|mv\|cp` | `tugutil/src/commands/file.rs` | Git-aware file lifecycle verbs that print a `TUG-FILE-RECEIPT` line; the way a glob or variable-driven operation becomes proof instead of a hint |
| `tugutil file edit` | `tugutil/src/commands/file.rs` | Substitution (`--path/--replace/--with`) and patch application (`--patch`) that receipt `modified` for every file whose bytes moved; the attributable form of a `perl -i` or `python3` heredoc edit |
| `tugutil file probe` | `tugutil/src/commands/file_probe.rs` | Patch → run → restore (bytes **and** mtime) as one verb; emits no receipt and mints no rows *by design* — see above |
| `tugutil file gate` | `tugutil/src/commands/file.rs` → `tugchanges-core::shell_ops` | The single grammar, shared with the relay so the two can't fork; prints an allow/deny decision as JSON and always exits 0 |
| The gate hook | `tugplug/hooks/gate-file-ops.sh` (Bash matcher in `hooks.json`) | Denies only the rm/mv-class and in-place-editor commands the grammar cannot read, steering at the verb the refusal names; fails open; composes with `auto-approve-tug.sh` (deny wins over allow) |
| Dash commits | tugdash-core (`tugutil dash commit`) | A **separate** file-selection path on an isolated single-writer worktree; not governed by the bucket contract (auditing it for the same narrowing shape is a recorded follow-on) |

## Invariants (the short list)

1. **A dirty file is never invisible.** `git status -uall` is the read-side universe; the ledger annotates it, never filters it.
2. **A default commit is never silently partial.** Unattributed + no disposition → exit-3 refusal; any leftover is named in the receipt's `left_behind`.
3. **Capture never gates delivery.** Every relay intercept is best-effort: log, forward unchanged.
4. **Every capture source is upsert-idempotent** under the `(session, tool_use_id, file_path)` PK.
5. **Capture records provenance, never judgments.** All brackets are relay-local; no capture path observes or marks another session, and no row carries a cross-session flag.
6. **Proof decides; correlation only suggests — for every session, including the recording one.** A file is owned (attributed/foreign) or contended (`shared`) only through live **proof** rows (`exact`/`replay`/`claim`/`cmd` — every one of them names the file in the tool input; a parsed command's literal operand and a verb receipt's path qualify, a fingerprint delta never does). A `bash`/`turn` bracket row (a contaminated whole-tree delta that can equally be the user's own hand-save) never decides any bucket — at most it *hints* on an `unattributed` entry, and inclusion stays an explicit disposition. Wall-clock overlap is never evidence.
7. **A ledger row is live only until its path's next commit.** A commit spends the rows it absorbs; spent rows neither attribute nor contend, and ties degrade toward `unattributed` — visible, never falsely claimed.
8. **Shared and foreign files are opt-in only.** No default set includes them; `foreign` never blocks.
9. **The ledger is machine-global.** One `changes.db` regardless of app instance, keyed by canonical repo root — attribution truth is never split across instances that share a working tree.
10. **Repo membership is a per-file fact.** A row's `project_dir` is the file's own repo root (worktree-aware, resolved from the file's path at capture), never the session's project dir — a dash session's worktree edits are keyed to the worktree, and a session can span repos without misfiling a single row.
11. **No replay reconstruction.** A fingerprint delta that wasn't captured live is gone; the bucket surfacing, not heroics, makes that safe.
12. **Capture failure is loud.** A tool frame that fails the attribution parse, a `replay_batch` that fails to unwrap, a replay bracket open past its deadline, a live turn completing inside a replay bracket, a drain-line exception, and every ledger write error all warn — an attribution outage announces itself in the log the moment it starts, never hours later in a Changes card (the 07-25 blackout class).
13. **Replay brackets always close.** Every `replay_started` is followed by exactly one `replay_complete` on every exit path — success, abort, timeout, subprocess exit, or exception — and the relay watchdog bounds the damage if the guarantee is ever broken anyway.
