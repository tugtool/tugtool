# Tuglaws — Reading Guide

*Where to look for what. Each entry below is a single source of truth for its topic; cross-references take you between docs without duplicating content.*

## Start here

- [framework-architecture.md](framework-architecture.md) — Narrative overview of the tug framework: React for tree reconciliation, CSS+DOM for appearance, the responder chain for action routing. Read first.
- [tuglaws.md](tuglaws.md) — The numbered laws (`[L##]`). Invariants every change is checked against; violations require updating the design first.
- [design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md) — The numbered decisions (`[D##]`). Each entry records a non-obvious choice and its rationale; laws reference decisions and vice versa.
- [recipes.md](recipes.md) — Named patterns the laws imply but don't spell out (`[R#]`). Reach for the recipe by name when a situation matches; reference implementations cited inline.

## Component & UI architecture

- [pane-model.md](pane-model.md) — The Deck → Pane → Card hierarchy. What each level owns; the naming rules that encode it across code, CSS, DOM, wire format, and menus.
- [card-state-model.md](card-state-model.md) — Selection, focus, scroll, and form-control values across tabs, pane activation, and reload. The per-axis contract; cross-refs `state-preservation.md` for the underlying protocol.
- [state-preservation.md](state-preservation.md) — The [A9] save/restore protocol end-to-end: `useComponentStatePreservation`, `useCardStatePreservation`, FocusSnapshot, CardStateBag. Read this for the mechanism; read `card-state-model.md` for the per-axis contract.
- [lifecycle-delegates.md](lifecycle-delegates.md) — The deck-level `TugCardDelegate` event pipe: construction, activation, deactivation, move, resize, destruction. The `MessageChannel` drain queue; `CardHost` portal lifecycle.
- [route-lifecycle.md](route-lifecycle.md) — The per-prompt-entry `RouteLifecycle` pipe: how the command route is held as external state and how route changes reach observers. The route-scoped sibling of `lifecycle-delegates.md` — synchronous, finer-grained.
- [turn-lifecycle.md](turn-lifecycle.md) — The Dev session's assistant-turn state machine as one derived projection (`deriveLifecycleSnapshot` / `canSubmit`), and the source→delegate rule ([L28]): controls that change a turn's settings subscribe to that projection and decline while a turn is live, never reaching into the running turn.
- [responder-chain.md](responder-chain.md) — The tree of components that own semantic state, and the walk that routes typed actions through them. Read before writing any component that emits or handles an action.
- [action-naming.md](action-naming.md) — The action vocabulary. Every action has one canonical `kebab-case` name, exported as a `TUG_ACTIONS.*` constant, referenced by constant at every call site.
- [commands.md](commands.md) — The command registry and the two funnels ([L30]): one entry per user-invocable command, `dispatchCommand` for invocation, `keymapRegistry` for chords. The entry shape, the procedure for adding a command, the four-layer chord resolution order, what is deliberately not a command, and the lints that enforce it. Read before adding any menu item, chord, or command-bearing control.
- [chord-tiers.md](chord-tiers.md) — The modifier algebra that decides which chord a command gets ([D126]): two base tiers (⌘ universal, ⌃⌘ Tug machinery), two operators (⇧ counterpart, ⌥ variant), the composed and closed sets, the six rules including ⌘. parity, the plain-⌘ free pool, the macOS never-bind list, and the known anomalies. Read before granting or moving any chord.
- [menus.md](menus.md) — The macOS menu bar as a projection of the command registry: the `menuState` wire contract including the per-item `commands` gate, the mirror-first validation model, the four-layer chord resolution order, the generated command catalog and chord table, and the identifier namespace.
- [component-authoring.md](component-authoring.md) — The component author's checklist. How to build a tugways component end-to-end — files, hooks, attributes, tokens, tests.
- [focus-language.md](focus-language.md) — The keyboard-focus model: focus is a ring + behind-tint, selection is a native fill, motion is two planes (Tab linear / arrows spatial) with explicit commit. The engine attributes appearance reads, and the authoring contract (focusGroup / persistentDefaultRing / useSeedKeyView / useSpatialOrder). Read before adding a focusable control or a dialog/sheet/alert.
- [animation-doctrine.md](animation-doctrine.md) — Motion law: the quiet contract ([D1]) and the event clock ([D7]) as organizing laws, the residency classes with their measured prices, the qualifying form for compositor-contained transforms, the finisher/falling-edge disciplines, and the bench-before-shipping falsification method. Read before authoring any continuous or programmatic motion.
- [entity-presentation.md](entity-presentation.md) — How a reference is painted: placed things are atoms (two skins — boxed where manipulable in place, glyph-plus-name everywhere read-only), written things are mentions (the characters as written, plus a 1px resting underline once a resolver confirms them). The two orthogonal channels (code tone from backticks, the rule from the verdict), the one detection gate, the labelling rule, where the rule's selector list is registered, and the retired alternatives. Read before changing how any file path, commit sha, or session reference looks.
- [list-view-usage.md](list-view-usage.md) — House rules for `TugListView` consumers: compose `TugListRow`, never reimplement the row state ramp, the selection-ownership matrix, the consumer inventory, and the sanctioned custom-cell exceptions.
- [scroll-intent.md](scroll-intent.md) — The scroll attribution doctrine: unattributed scrolls belong to the user, no deferred scroll write survives a user gesture. The WKWebView attribution inventory (including the event-silent native scrollbar), the supersede table, the removal-time clamp model with the extent floor as its defense and the commit bracket as its witness, follow-bottom's polarity, and the rule new `scrollTop` writers must satisfy. Grounds [D93]'s phase guard.
- [slash-commands.md](slash-commands.md) — How Claude Code slash commands flow through Tug end-to-end: the three-tier model (`supported-local` / `pass-through` / `hidden`), catalog sources, the decision procedure for mapping a command, the mechanical recipes, output flow-back, and the probe-and-fixture discipline. Read before touching slash-command support.
- [session-card-unsupported-slash-commands.md](session-card-unsupported-slash-commands.md) — Why some of Claude Code's slash commands are hidden from the session card's `/` popup. The maintained mirror of `HIDDEN_SLASH_COMMANDS` in `slash-supported.ts`; the discoverable answer to "why isn't `/vim` here?". Doctrine lives in `slash-commands.md`.
- [turn-metric.md](turn-metric.md) — The one canonical definition of a "turn": tugcode `totalTurns` is the authority, every other counter reconciles to it. The turn rule (S01), the `#t…m…` transcript address (S02), the four-way equality invariant, and the rewind carve-out.

## Changes & commits

- [tracking-changes.md](tracking-changes.md) — How a session's file changes are captured, classified, and committed. The two-layer doctrine (capture annotates, git status decides), the `file_events` ledger, the four capture origins (`exact`/`bash`/`turn`/`replay`), per-file contention (`shared`) and the row-liveness rule, the capture-gap inventory, the three read-side buckets (attributed/foreign/unattributed), and the commit disposition contract (exit-3 refusal, `--tree`, `left_behind`). Read before touching attribution, `tugutil preflight`/`commit`/`draft`, or the draft skill.

## Theming, palette, tokens

- [token-naming.md](token-naming.md) — The seven-slot prefix scheme for CSS custom properties. Every design-system token declares its kind in its name.
- [color-palette.md](color-palette.md) — The TugColor OKLCH palette. Components consume semantic tokens; the palette provides the colors those tokens resolve to.
- [theme-engine.md](theme-engine.md) — The CSS-first, file-based theme runtime. How themes load, switch, and override tokens at runtime.

## Testing & build infrastructure

- [app-test-harness.md](app-test-harness.md) — Architecture of the `Tug.app` integration-test harness: subprocess driving, WKWebView, the trusted-event problem, fidelity envelope, lifecycle model.
- [code-signing-mac.md](code-signing-mac.md) — The `Tug Dev` self-signed signing pipeline (macOS only). Why the app-test harness depends on it; procedures and failure modes.
- [wasm-crates.md](wasm-crates.md) — WASM crates in tugdeck (`tugmark-wasm`, `tugdiff-wasm`). Per-crate layout, build pipeline, lazy-load convention, and the checklist for adding a new one.

## Templates

- [devise-skeleton.md](devise-skeleton.md) — Template for plan documents (the format `/tugplug:devise` authors and `/tugplug:implement` walks). Kept here per user decision; it is a template, not a tuglaws law or architecture doc.
- [plan-review-rubric.md](plan-review-rubric.md) — What a reviewer judges when reading a plan, and what belongs to `tugutil plan lint` instead. Read by `/tugplug:review-plan` and `/tugplug:audit`.
