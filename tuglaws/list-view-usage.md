# TugListView Usage — House Rules

*One list primitive, one row. This is the single source of truth for how a
`TugListView` consumer renders rows, owns selection, and picks its knobs. Read
it before adding or touching any `TugListView` cell renderer.*

`TugListView` is the framework's windowed list primitive (UIKit `UITableView`
lineage). `TugListRow` is its row (UIKit `UITableViewCell` lineage) — it owns
the leading / content / trailing layout and the rest → hover → selected →
selected-hover state ramp, all token-driven ([L06], [L15]). A consumer supplies
a *data source* and a *cell renderer*; the cell renderer's job is to compose
`TugListRow`, not to reinvent it.

## The rules

1. **`TugListRow` is the only sanctioned row.** Every cell renderer composes
   `<TugListRow>` for its row chrome. A cell renders fully custom markup *only*
   when its content is not a row — rich streaming content, dense tabular data —
   and then it carries an inline comment naming it a sanctioned exception (see
   [Sanctioned exceptions](#sanctioned-exceptions)).

2. **No consumer reimplements the row state ramp.** Selection / hover / disabled
   row visuals belong to `TugListRow`. Consumer CSS must never paint
   `[data-selected]`, `:hover`, or `[data-disabled]` row *backgrounds* — that is
   a duplicate system that silently drifts from the primitive and won't inherit
   its improvements. Consumer CSS styles only consumer-specific affordances
   (a trailing trash reveal, a status badge), never the ramp.
   Both row text lines are ONE rendering path: `title` and `subtitle` each go
   through a single `TugLabel` whether the caller passes a string or a node, so
   `subtitleMaxLines` and the selected-row recolor behave identically for both.
   `.tug-list-row-title` / `.tug-list-row-subtitle` are naming hooks for a
   consumer that must bend one list's text; they declare no typography of their
   own.

3. **Use `title` / `subtitle`, not `children` — highlighted text included.**
   The structured path renders through `TugLabel`, so row text matches the rest
   of the app, and both slots accept a `ReactNode`: filter/search matches
   compose as `renderFilterHighlight(displayString, query)` straight into
   `title` / `subtitle`, keeping the row's typography, truncation, and selected
   recolor. Pass the string the row actually renders (already truncated,
   already abbreviated) — highlight ranges index THAT string, and ranges taken
   from a raw source field paint at the wrong offsets. The `children` escape
   hatch bypasses `TugLabel` entirely — reach for it *only* when the primary
   content is genuinely not text (an RTL middle-ellipsis path, a two-column
   matcher row), and then add a one-line comment justifying it and apply the
   shared title typography so it still reads consistently ([L20] keeps the
   row's tokens; the cell just opts into them).

4. **Single-select with a checkmark uses `selectedGlyph="check"`.** Never
   hand-roll a fixed-width check holder in `leading` — `selectedGlyph` reserves
   the column and aligns titles for you.

5. **Read-only listings pass `interactive={false}`.** A list that does not act
   on click should not imply it does (no hover affordance, out of the tab
   order).

5a. **The focus mark is the primitive's, and a consumer does not draw it.**
   A keyboard-focused list wears exactly ONE mark: the **cursor row**'s
   leading-edge **bar** (`--tugx-focus-cursor-bar-*`) at full accent. The
   container draws nothing — no perimeter ring, no wash, no border-colour change
   in any theme — because the bar sits inside the list and therefore already
   says which list holds the keyboard ([focus-language.md](focus-language.md)).
   The bar holds at full strength through a descend into a row's accessories,
   because a descend goes deeper into the list rather than out of it, and the
   lit row is what addresses the descended control.
   A host that finds the mark wrong on its surface fixes the shared token or the
   component, never its own stylesheet. An edge-to-edge list in a clipping host
   needs nothing special, and this is where the container ring was most
   expensive: drawing a perimeter from inside a scroller took a sticky overlay
   child, a JS-measured scrollport height and scrollbar width, a two-layer band
   split by the clip, and a z-index lift. All of it is gone with the mark. Do
   not rebuild any of it for the next edge-to-edge surface.
5b. **A list's arrow edges hand on; they do not clamp, and no consumer opts in.**
   Every engine-authored list registers its spatial cursor handle
   unconditionally — the opt-in prop is gone — because the handle is what makes
   the list's *edges* visible to the navigator, and the edges are what carry an
   arrow onward when the cursor runs off the end: to a declared seam where the
   surface authored one, else along the liveliness net (the Lens's next
   section). Interior arrows are unchanged. The handle is **vertical-axis only**:
   a one-column list would otherwise read as a 1-D run in which `Left` means
   "cursor up", so horizontal arrows fall through to the surface's seams instead
   — while `ArrowRight` still descends into a row's accessories first, which is
   consulted ahead of any movement.

   A list that can be filtered to zero rows must withhold its `focusGroup` when
   empty, the way the Lens sections gate theirs on `navigable` — the wash is a
   sufficient container mark only because a cursor bar sits inside it, so a
   focusable list with no rows would have no legible focus indicator at all.

6. **House layout is `flush`.** In-sheet listings use `rowLayout="flush"`.
   `pill` is reserved for free-standing, card-like rows *outside* a bordered list
   frame. A list inside a bordered frame uses `flush`.

7. **Rows are separated by a line OR a band, never both, and never from consumer CSS.** `rowSeparator` draws the hairline between rows; `rowStriping` tints alternate rows instead. They say the same thing, so a list that turns one on turns the other off — a striped list with hairlines too is stating its structure twice. Both are the primitive's, and the band especially cannot be hand-rolled in a consumer stylesheet: `:nth-child` is read against the *rendered window*, not the data, so a consumer zebra rule makes the bands crawl as the window slides under a scroll. The primitive publishes `data-row-parity` from the absolute row index for exactly this reason. **Both parities paint** — odd rows wash toward the surface's foreground, even rows toward its content surface, which are opposites in every theme. Washing one parity and leaving the other on the host surface is the obvious construction and it is wrong: one step of a few percent is legible only when it repeats, so a long list looks banded while a two-row list looks like two identical rows. Strength is a named rung (`"faint"` / `"subtle"` / `"medium"` / `"strong"` = 2 / 4 / 7 / 11%) or any percent, and it applies to both directions, so the step between neighbours is twice it.

8. **A dense list sets its text measure once, with `rowTextSize`.** Rows in one list agreeing on a size matters more than each cell renderer picking for itself, so the prop deliberately outranks each `TugLabel`'s own `size`. It reaches the content column only — shrinking a list's type must not shrink its close boxes. Lists that read as one rail — the Lens's Cards list and the Jots card's, which stand one above the other when both sidebars share a side — share one measure from one place; see `lens-list-presentation.ts`.

9. **An in-row action is not a row pick, and it names its target.** A close box, a trash button, a reveal — any `TugIconButton` in a row — acts on the row it sits in; picking that row is a different gesture with different consequences (a Lens Cards pick fronts the bound card). `TugListView` keeps them apart for you: a pointer gesture that lands on a focus-refusing control (`data-tug-focus="refuse"`, which every `TugIconButton` carries) commits no selection and moves no cursor. A consumer must not try to arrange this itself with `stopPropagation` on the button's click — **selection commits at pointerdown**, which has already bubbled by the time any click handler runs, so the click-level guard reads as if it worked while the row was picked a moment earlier. The action's own dispatch then has to say WHICH row it acts on: send `close-tab` with the card id, not `close`, or the pane closes whichever card is front and the user watches the wrong file go.

## Selection ownership matrix

Pick the mechanism by the list's intent — do not invent a third path.

| List intent | Mechanism | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Always exactly one selected (navigation / picker) | `selectionRequired` — list-view-owned, mirrored via `onSelectionChange` ([L24]) | session picker, recents |
| Pick-to-confirm (commit on OK) | consumer-owned: `delegate.onSelect` → `useState` | model / effort picker |
| Read-only display | none + `interactive={false}` | skills / agents / help listings |
| Tool-output display | none + `inline` | transcript body-kinds |

## Consumer inventory

Every `TugListView` consumer and the row model it uses. Keep this current when
adding a consumer.

| Consumer | Cell model | Selection | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `help-sheet` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle | none, read-only | |
| `agents-sheet` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle | none, read-only | |
| `skills-sheet` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle + leading | none, read-only | |
| `memory-sheet` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle | consumer | |
| `permission-mode-chip` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle + leading | consumer | |
| `model-picker-sheet` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle + `selectedGlyph` | consumer | |
| `effort-picker-sheet` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle + `selectedGlyph` | consumer | |
| `permission-rules-editor` | `TugListRow` (matcher rides `children`, justified) | consumer | |
| dev session picker (`session-picker-cells`) | `TugListRow` title/subtitle (both filter-highlighted) + trailing trash | `selectionRequired` | filtered by `TugFilterField` |
| dev recents (`session-picker-cells`) | `TugListRow` `children` (RTL path + `<mark>`, justified) | `selectionRequired` | |
| `/resume` overlay (`resume-sheet`) | the session-picker cells | none | filtered by `TugFilterField` |
| lens Cards (`cards-section`) | four cell models over `TugListRow`: the session monitor (leading dot + trailing sparkline), the one-line card row (leading close box + slot picker on the title line), the generic indented subrow, and the group-header row (leading kind glyph + count, a trailing `BlockFoldCue` — the section band's own affordance one size down — and Space toggles the group) | none, cursor only | filtered by `TugFilterField`; one-line rows take striping + measure from `lens-list-presentation.ts`. Headers are `"cell"`-role, NOT the inert `"header"` role, so the arrow walk reaches them — which is why the section always passes an `initialSelectedIndex` (the cursor must seed onto a card, never onto a collapse toggle) |
| Jots card (`jots-card`) | `TugListRow` `children` (incipit, drag source + inline markdown) | `selectionRequired` | filtered by `TugFilterField`; one-line list — striping + measure from `lens-list-presentation.ts` |
| `gallery-list-view-filter` | custom path cells | none | the `useFilteredDataSource` wrapper's living contract |
| `rewind-sheet` | `TugListRow` title/subtitle | consumer | |
| transcript body-kinds (`path-list`, `todo-list`, `search-result`) | see [Sanctioned exceptions](#sanctioned-exceptions) | none, `inline` | |
| `session-card-transcript` | custom streaming turn cells | none, `inline` | sanctioned exception |

## Sanctioned exceptions

A cell may bypass `TugListRow` only if it appears here with a rationale.

- **`session-card-transcript` — streaming turn cells.** A transcript turn is not a
  row: it hosts streaming markdown, tool blocks, approval prompts, and inline
  questions, observed directly from stores ([L22]) and grown imperatively
  ([L06]). `AssistantTurnCell` and the user/tool turn cells are custom React
  components by design. They still participate in `TugListView` windowing,
  lifecycle, and `pageByEntry` navigation — only the *row chrome* is bespoke.

- **Tool-output body-kinds — `path-list-block`, `todo-list-block`,
  `search-result-block`.** Dense, status-driven tool-output rows, not
  title/subtitle rows: a todo row carries a per-status background band, a
  strikethrough-on-completed text decoration, a live `TugProgressIndicator`
  ring for the in-progress icon, and per-status single-line-vs-wrap behavior;
  path and search rows are monospace paths and match-count layouts. Expressing
  these through `TugListRow` would require pervasive overrides reaching into
  the primitive's internals (its title `TugLabel`, its padding, its background)
  — an [L20] token-sovereignty violation — and would regress the compact
  density these checklists depend on. They render in `inline` mode, hold no
  selection (so they do **not** duplicate the selection/disabled ramp), and
  their only state affordance is a `:hover` background drawn from the shared
  `--tugx-block-row-hover-bg` token. They remain custom cells by design.

## Filtering a list

A long list gets a `TugFilterField` (see its module docstring for the delegate
contract). Two mechanisms are sanctioned, and the choice is about the cells:

- **In-source** (every product surface). The data source takes a `filterQuery`
  input and applies `filterQueryMatch` inside its own `recompute()`. Rows,
  `rowAt`, `indexForId`, selection, and the cursor then live in ONE filtered
  coordinate space, which is what typed cell renderers (`dataSource.rowAt(i)`
  on a concrete class) need. **A list index names a row in the projection,
  never a position in the underlying document** — any consumer that turns an
  index back into a model object must go through the data source.
- **Wrapper** (`useFilteredDataSource`). The generic composition path, for
  consumers whose cells do not depend on a concrete data-source type; cells
  translate indices with `baseIndexFor`. `gallery-list-view-filter` is its
  living contract and the composition point for future sorting/grouping
  wrappers.

Matching is fuzzy, multi-term AND across a row's fields, and **ranked**: while a
query is active the rows sort best-match-first, and the moment it clears they
return to their native order untouched — so a drag-arranged or persisted order
is never rewritten, only temporarily set aside (reorder gestures are disabled
while a filter is on, so the two orders never fight).

One rule earns its keep on long lists: a match must be **compact**. `scoreMatch`
accepts any in-order character run, which is right for a ≤50-item popup and
useless over rows carrying whole sentences — five scattered letters "match" any
prompt, so a 900-row list filters to 900 rows. `filterMatchScore` rejects a
match whose span far exceeds the characters it matched, keeping the acronym-ish
hits (`sesldg` → `session-ledger-store`) and dropping the noise.
