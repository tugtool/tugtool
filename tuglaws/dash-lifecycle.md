# The dash lifecycle

*What a dash **is**, what its states mean, and what a binding is. The companion file [dash-work-doctrine.md](dash-work-doctrine.md) covers the other half — how an **agent** behaves once it is working on one. Two audiences, two files: a person asking "why does this dash read as parked" and an agent asking "may I write here" are not asking the same question.*

## What a dash is

A dash is four things and no more:

1. **A git branch**, `tugdash/<name>`.
2. **A worktree**, conventionally `.tug/worktrees/<name>` under the main repository root.
3. **Branch config** — `branch.tugdash/<name>.{tugbase,description,tugid,tugplan}`.
4. **A dash-log**, the append-only record of rounds and declarations.

There is no dash database. Every fact any surface renders about a dash is read from one of those four on demand, which is why `tugutil dash list` and the Changes card cannot disagree: both call `dash_detail_entries_in` (`tugdash-core/src/ops.rs`), which is the one composition.

**Every dash op resolves the main repository root first.** `main_repo_root` normalizes whatever root it was asked from, because a dash's branch and worktree live in the *main* repository whichever checkout the question came from — and a card's project directory may itself be a linked worktree (`just app-debug` produces exactly that). A path handed outward is therefore **absolute**, resolved where the main root is known ([D138]); nothing downstream composes one, because nothing downstream can.

## Identity

The owner key is `tugdash/<name>#<tugid>` (`dash_owner_key`). It is **opaque** — never a git ref, never displayed. Draft rows, session-binding rows, and the deck's `(workspace_key, owner_kind, owner_id)` draft-overlay key are all this same string, so entry, row, and overlay agree by construction.

What the key buys is that two incarnations of a reused name are distinct: release `fix-join` and create it again and the second one is a different dash, so the first one's draft cannot surface under it.

- Anything that needs a **ref** reads the `branch` field. Never the owner key.
- Anything that needs a **name** for a human reads `display_name`.
- A dash created before ids existed keys under its bare branch ref. `legacy_owner_key` strips a key to that form, and `tugutil draft` reads through it and supersedes — the first resolution through the legacy key rewrites the row under the current key, so the population it serves shrinks to zero on its own.
- **Read paths never mint.** `dash_owner_key` returns the bare ref when there is no `tugid`; only write-path verbs (`create`, `commit`, the `/api/dash` bind handler) call `ensure_dash_id`. A read that wrote git config would be a side-effecting read and a multi-process race on every feed recompute.

## The stages, and derive vs declare

`derive_stage(rounds, worktree_dirty, has_draft, landing, declared)` returns one of seven words, in this precedence:

| Stage | When | Kind |
|---|---|---|
| `landing` | a join journal exists — an interrupted teardown | derived |
| `implementing` | a `dash step` declaration is the latest | declared |
| `built` | `dash mark built` | declared |
| `audited` | `dash mark audited` | declared |
| `draft-ready` | a maintained join draft exists | derived |
| `working` | rounds past base, or a dirty worktree | derived |
| `created` | none of the above | derived |

`landing` outranks everything, including a declaration, because an interrupted teardown is the one state that actively needs a person.

**The rule: anything git can see is derived on every read and never stored; anything it cannot is declared once, in the dash-log, by a verb** ([D138]). Rounds, dirt, and the journal are visible to git, so they are recomputed every time and cannot go stale. "This build succeeded" and "I am on step 4 of 9" are not visible to git at all, so a verb writes them down. **A stage is never written to a config key** — that would make the derived half stale-able and the declared half duplicated.

## Binding

A **bind** mates a live session to a dash. It is a UI concept: git has no idea it happened.

- It lives in the per-instance `sessions.db` and is read back **live-sessions-only** (`bound_sessions_for`). That is exactly why a dash whose cards have all closed reads as *parked* — parked is not a stage, it is the absence of workers.
- It is **per-card**. A session has at most one dash, which is why `unbind_dash`'s whole payload is the session id.
- It **mints**: `bind_dash` naming a dash that does not exist succeeds anyway. Every sender therefore builds its frame from a snapshot row rather than from user text; the one place that accepts a typed name (`/dash-bind <name>`) matches the snapshot first and routes an unknown name to `dash create` through the shell, where the receipt says what was made.
- Two cards on one dash is **legal**, not a race: `bound_sessions` is a list and the Lens renders one jump chip per bound session. A bind displaces only *this* card's previous binding.
- A bind is **never a landing authority**. It says who is working; it does not say who may land.
- The store moves on the **broadcast**, never on the gesture: `bind_dash_ok` / `unbind_dash_ok` are the only movers of `cardSessionBindingStore`, which is what leaves a card correctly bound to what it was when a bind is refused.

## Landing — by reference

A dash lands by `/dash-join <name>` into its base: a preview runs on entry, the squash message is edited in the composer, and the land is the human's act. Skills draft; humans land.

The doctrine — the two beats, the one-slot `LandingMode`, and the five outcomes a join can reach — is held in [tracking-changes.md](tracking-changes.md#the-landing-workflow), where the capture and commit layer beneath it already lives. It is law where it stands and is deliberately not restated here.

## Naming

An operation is spelled the same everywhere, and that spelling is its `tugutil` verb path, hyphenated: the card verbs are **`/dash-bind`** and **`/dash-join`**.

`dash` and `join` survive as **retired spellings**, and are not scheduled for deletion. They are kept for muscle memory, which does not expire on a release schedule, and `deprecatedFor` excludes them from the completion popup so they are invisible to discovery. The failure mode is what decides it: a `/verb` that stops matching the local registry is submitted to Claude as a prompt — a burned turn on a line the user meant as a gesture.
