# Entity presentation — placed atoms, written mentions

A file path in the transcript could once be painted four different ways and a commit sha three, and which one you got was decided by the container the entity arrived in — an editor atom, a tool input, a ref list, a pair of backticks the model happened to type. The container is a fact about our plumbing that the reader cannot see and does not care about. This doc is the rule that replaced it, and it is a rule about **authorship**.

Origin: `roadmap/entity-presentation.md`, which carries the full argument and the record of what was auditioned on the bench.

## The rule

**An atom is something someone _placed_. A mention is something someone _wrote_.**

The rule's value is that it is never a judgment call: **placed things arrive in a slot, written things arrive in a stream**, and the substrate records which before anything renders.

| Arrived as | Authorship | Form |
|---|---|---|
| `U+FFFC` plus an entry in the `atoms` array | the user picked it from `@`-completion | **Atom** |
| a tool call's `file_path` JSON field | the system placed it in a field | **Atom** |
| an entry in a Gazette post's `refs` array | the model placed it in a list | **Atom** |
| a commit record's sha, in a receipt header or a History row | the record placed it in a field | **Atom** |
| characters inside a markdown string | somebody wrote a word | **Mention** |

No heuristic, no resolver verdict, no per-surface flag, no backtick inspection decides the form. Placed-ness is structural, so it cannot drift.

The user/assistant axis is really *picked versus typed*, and it cuts across both. `@`-mention a file and you get an atom; type the same path by hand into the same message and you get a mention. Those genuinely were two different acts. What you placed comes back as what you placed.

## Vocabulary

Four words, used precisely. A change that renames them is fine; a change that blurs them is not.

- **Atom** — the rendering of a *placed* value. Shows a **name**, never the raw value. Two skins, never more.
- **Editable skin** — the boxed chip (`TugAtomChip`, and the CM6 `createAtomImgElement`). Only where the object can be selected, deleted, or dragged **in place**: the composer, and its echo in the submitted message.
- **Read-only skin** — glyph plus label, transparent, no border (`TugAtomRef`). Everywhere else a placed value appears: tool-call headers, pulse beats, Gazette trailing refs, commit receipts, History rows.
- **Mention** — the rendering of a *written* value: the characters exactly as written, plus the resting rule when a resolver confirms them.

There is no third form. "Chip", "ref", and "citation" are legacy words for one of the two skins and are not separate concepts.

The box is not a form, it is a **skin**, and it means one thing: *this object is manipulable where it sits*. Treating the box as a third form is what let two components drift into being the same thing — `ToolFileRef` was the read-only atom for years before anyone noticed we had built it twice.

## Two channels, not one

Backticks stopped gating *actionability* and kept gating *emphasis*. These are orthogonal channels, and confusing them was ours to fix, not the reader's.

| Channel | Says | Driven by |
|---|---|---|
| **Code tone** (mono + `--tugx-md-inline-code-*`) | *the author formatted this as code* | the backticks, exactly as `*` drives italic |
| **The rule** (1px underline) | *this responds to a click* | the resolver verdict, and nothing else |

They compose four ways and every combination is legible: backticked and resolves = code tone plus the rule; bare and resolves = body colour plus the rule; backticked and resolves to nothing = code tone alone; bare and nothing = plain prose.

The code tone **stays** on a confirmed path. Stripping it would be us overriding what the author wrote, which is the same fidelity violation the rule refuses when it declines to replace prose with a box.

## One detection gate

`resolvePath` is the gate, and it is the only one. Detection is permissive by design and every path-shaped token on every surface is sent to the resolver; nothing becomes a link until a resolver confirms a real file. Markup does not gate, and neither does the surface: there is no per-surface "this prose cites paths" flag, and there is no license earned by sitting inside `<code>`.

The cost of a wrong guess is one cached lookup and text that stays text. The cost of the old license was that the identical sentence naming the identical file was a live reference in one card and dead text in another.

## The resting rule

A confirmed **Mention** carries, at rest:

```css
text-decoration-line: underline;
text-decoration-style: solid;
text-decoration-thickness: 1px;
text-decoration-color: color-mix(in srgb, currentColor 45%, transparent);
text-underline-offset: 0.2em;
```

On hover it takes the full link treatment, unchanged.

Three things about this are load-bearing:

- **It is an underline, not a tint.** Colour is not an affordance. A hue shift says *this token is a different category of thing*, which is what the code tone already says, and stacking a second subtler hue on top asks the reader to read two levels of one channel and infer *clickable* from the difference. Nobody learns that. An underline is the one signal already learned to mean *you can act on this*.
- **It is weight, not absence.** Six mentions in a paragraph is the density that once produced a resting-plain rule — the affordance removed entirely, so you could not hover what you did not know was there. The answer is a quiet rule, settled at 45% against exactly that paragraph. 28% and 70%-dotted were auditioned and rejected.
- **It costs no layout metric.** A verdict lands *after* the ink is painted. `text-decoration` never reflows, so a late answer can add the signal to a streaming transcript without moving anything. A border, a padding, or a font change here would not have that property, and none may be added.

The colour is derived from the ink it underlines, so it needs no per-theme value, cannot drift across the six themes, and is deliberately absent from `audit:theme-contrast`. Do not give it a `--tug7-*` token.

### Where the rule is registered

The kinds that take the rule are enumerated, not wildcarded, in two places:

- `tugdeck/styles/tug-annotation.css` — runs the annotator split out of prose (`[data-tugx-wrapped]`).
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-markdown-view.css` — whole inline `<code>` spans the annotator marked.

**Adding a Mention kind means adding it to those lists.** What is excluded, and why:

- `session` — a confirmed session run is the mount point for a live citation chip, which carries its own affordance and empties the span it mounts into. The chip is the atom; the run is only its host.
- `url` / `email` — anchors, already links.
- The atom skins — elements of their own, with their own hover; they never carry `[data-tugx-wrapped]` and match nothing in those lists.

An inline `<code>` span with no annotation matches nothing and looks exactly as it always has. That is the test that the two channels really are independent.

## An atom labels itself; a mention is labelled by its sentence

An atom's label is a **name**, never the raw value. A file atom shows its basename. A commit atom shows `Commit 227a8eb9`.

The word is part of the label because an atom stands with no sentence around it. Eight bare hex characters name nothing a reader can act on, and a small glyph does not rescue them. A sha *written in prose* needs no help, because the sentence supplies the word — and adding one would be the same fidelity violation as replacing the characters with a box.

One consequence worth stating: because the label is what the DOM holds, and plain copy writes the selection's own text, the label is also the clipboard spelling. One string, not two.

## Why prose mentions are not atoms

"Make every actionable thing a chip" is the obvious proposal and it is wrong for two reasons.

**Measurable.** `tug-atom-markdown-body.css` floors *every* markdown line — chip-bearing or not — to `max(1lh, atom-height + 4px)`. The floor serves a hard invariant: an atom must never change line height. Extend chips into assistant prose and the floor extends to every paragraph in the transcript, whether or not it names a file.

**About what a transcript is.** A chip does not decorate text, it **replaces** it. `session-citation-portals.tsx` empties the span it mounts into, and the original spelling has to be preserved on `data-tugx-session-text` precisely so the words can be put back if the mark is later dropped. That is honest when an object is what was there and a lie when it is not: the model wrote the characters `session-restore.ts` into a sentence, and a box asserts it placed an object. The transcript's contract is that it shows what was written.

The counter-evidence, recorded so it is not re-discovered as an objection: we already put atoms in prose, since session citations mint a live chip into a confirmed run. It works there for two reasons that do not generalize — a post names *one* session, and the chip carries a live status dot that text genuinely cannot render. Neither holds for file paths, which are dense and static.

## Behavior is not presentation

`tugdeck/src/lib/annotator/registry.ts` owns what a gesture *does*: nine kinds, one delegated listener, one context-menu provider. A file path opens in a Text card whatever painted it. None of the above changes any of that, and a presentation change that needs to touch `registry.ts` is a sign the change is not a presentation change.

The read-only skin has two stamping modes for exactly this reason. It stamps the annotation contract on itself where nothing else does (tool headers, pulse beats), and stamps nothing where a host already owns the contract — the Gazette's wrapper span, which also owns the pending and unresolvable tooltip states, and `CommitShaText`, which owns every pointer gesture on a sha so a right-click cannot fold the History row out from under its own menu.

The link affordance rides the annotation contract rather than a modifier class: an annotated skin, or a skin inside an annotated wrapper, is clickable. A ref nothing could resolve carries no annotation anywhere and so invites nothing, with no prop threaded to say so. "Annotated" and "actionable" are the same fact.

## Retired — do not re-propose

Each was considered and rejected with a reason, and each is the obvious next idea for a cold reader.

- **A resting colour or tint for a resolved entity.** Failed on the bench. Colour is not an affordance, and it collides with the code tone, which already uses that channel to mean something else.
- **Token / Ref / Mention as three peer forms.** The box is a *skin*, not a form. Treating it as a third form is what let two components drift into being the same thing.
- **Unboxing every placed value on the theory that boxes mean "editing".** Half right. Boxes mean *manipulable in place*. The Gazette's trailing refs row is read-only, so it unboxes — but its entries stay **atoms**, because `refs` is a placed array. The row was never the defect; the prose beside it was, for looking like nothing.
- **Atoms (chips) for actionable entities in prose.** The measurable cost is the line-height floor spreading to every paragraph; the principled cost is that a chip replaces text the author wrote.
- **Folding a commit sha into the Mention form.** A sha in a receipt header is a field, not a sentence.
- **Stripping the code tone from a confirmed path so backticked and bare look identical.** That overrides the author's own emphasis, which is the same violation as replacing prose with a box.
- **Suppressing the Gazette's `unmentionedRefs` rule.** A ref the prose already named should still not also appear in the trailing row. The suppression was never the bug.
- **A theme token for the rule's colour.** It is `currentColor`-derived by construction. A token would let it drift.
