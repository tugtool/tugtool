      Tugtool agents have been installed to:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/tugtool/agents/

      Claude Code skills have been installed to:
        #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/share/tugtool/skills/

      To use /tugtool:planner and /tugtool:implementer in your projects, run:
        tugtool setup claude

      This will copy the skills to your project's .claude/skills/ directory.
      You can also run this during `tugtool init` for new projects.
