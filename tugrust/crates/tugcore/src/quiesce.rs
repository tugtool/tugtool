//! The `tug-quiesce` shutdown contract — one ladder, one set of numbers.
//!
//! Every Tug **service** (tugcast, tugcode, tugpulse; Tug.app as the
//! conductor) shuts down the same way:
//!
//! 1. **Quiesce request** — the parent asks the child to stop: an explicit
//!    `shutdown` message where a control channel exists, `SIGTERM`
//!    otherwise. Both funnel into the same shutdown path.
//! 2. **Flush window** — the service stops accepting work, flushes its
//!    ledgers (final `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`), fsyncs journals, closes
//!    its SQLite connections, and exits 0 — within
//!    [`FLUSH_BUDGET_MS`], which it enforces on *itself*: a hung flush
//!    must never wedge shutdown, so the budget expiring means exit
//!    anyway, loudly.
//! 3. **Escalation** — the conductor waits [`DRAIN_DEADLINE_MS`] for the
//!    group to drain, then `SIGKILL`s the remainder and records which
//!    PIDs needed it. A SIGKILL that actually fires is a defect signal
//!    ([`QUIESCE_REPORT_FILENAME`]), not routine housekeeping.
//!
//! These constants are the source of truth. Swift mirrors them in
//! `tugapp/Sources/InstanceConfig.swift` and TypeScript in
//! `tests/app-test/_harness/index.ts` and `tugcode/src/main.ts`; the
//! `quiesce_constants_are_mirrored` test below fails the build when a
//! mirror drifts.
