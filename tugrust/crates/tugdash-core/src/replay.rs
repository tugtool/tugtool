//! Base-motion replay — moving a dash's rounds onto a base that has advanced.
//!
//! The merge engine is the same one the join's resolution ladder uses for its
//! first rung: replay each round in memory with
//! `merge-tree --write-tree --merge-base=<round^>` + `commit-tree`. What lives
//! here is the *lifecycle* around it — the preconditions that say when acting is
//! safe, the compare-and-swap that moves a branch checked out in a live
//! worktree, and the bookkeeping that records where the rounds went.
//!
//! Nothing here resolves file content. A round that conflicts against the moved
//! base is reported, never merged: that is a question for whoever is working the
//! dash, and the landing-time ladder remains the fallback.
