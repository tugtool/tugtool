//! `tuggram` — the shell command-grammar grader.
//!
//! # What it answers
//!
//! Given a line the user typed, this crate says how strong the evidence is that
//! the line is a shell command, in four bands: **Yes | Maybe | No | Unknown**.
//! Routing a line to the shell is irreversible — the command has already run by
//! the time anyone notices the mistake — so a **Yes is definitive and routes**:
//! it runs the line with no model call at all. Every band short of definitive
//! is a Maybe, where the model reads the line with the program's own
//! documentation attached. That is the whole division of labor: the grader
//! rules on what it can recognize, and hands everything else to the model.
//!
//! # The band doctrine
//!
//! The bands are defined by **evidence strength, not validity**, and the
//! asymmetry is deliberate:
//!
//! - **No** requires evidence of *absence*: the line lexed cleanly and one of
//!   its segment heads resolves to nothing at all — not on the login PATH, not a
//!   shell builtin, not an existing executable file. Nothing else produces a No.
//! - **Yes** is a resolving head whose every token the grammar **recognized** —
//!   a known flag, a known subcommand, an enumerated value, an existing path.
//! - **Maybe** is a resolving head carrying any token the grammar could not
//!   recognize, including a token in a position the grammar leaves free.
//! - **Unknown** is a resolving head with no baked grammar, a line the lexer
//!   will not claim to understand, or a check the grader could not perform.
//!
//! A stale catalog, a wrapper script, a flag added in a newer release: all of
//! these degrade Yes → Maybe, never toward No. Failed *validation* is never
//! evidence of absence, so catalog drift costs one band of caution and can never
//! swallow a real command.
//!
//! # What it never does
//!
//! It never reads English — it declines to. `make the watch loop resilient` is
//! a syntactically valid `make` invocation, but `make`'s positionals are free,
//! so the grammar recognizes nothing in those four words and the line grades
//! **Maybe**. A free position is where English hides; accepting anything there
//! is not recognizing anything there. Whether that line is a target list or a
//! sentence is the model's question, not this crate's.
//!
//! It never executes anything at grading time. The catalog is baked in and the
//! harvester that builds it runs offline; the only filesystem work on the hot
//! path is `stat` — on a path-shaped command word, and on a path positional
//! whose existence is what would make its line definitive.
