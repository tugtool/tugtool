//! The session shell's word table: the names it resolves ahead of `$PATH`, and
//! what the readable ones expand to.
//!
//! # Why the shell is asked at all
//!
//! The thing that will run a routed line is `$SHELL -il` with the user's rc
//! files in force, and it resolves a command word in its own order — alias,
//! function, builtin, then PATH. A grader that only knows PATH is wrong in both
//! directions: it cannot see `gs` (a function), cannot see `setopt` (a builtin),
//! and reads `gs` as ghostscript when the shell would never run ghostscript.
//! So membership is answered by interrogating a shell, never by parsing rc
//! files — rc files have conditionals, plugin managers, and machine-specific
//! branches, and the only ground truth for what a word means in this session is
//! the shell that will execute it.
//!
//! # What an expansion is worth
//!
//! An expansion never becomes the graded line. The subject of grading is always
//! what the user typed; a readable expansion contributes only the *grammar to
//! consult* and the *position within it*, so `gs -sb` can grade as git's
//! grammar entered at `status` carrying `-sb`. The shell does its own expanding
//! at run time, with the table live at that instant.
//!
//! # Conservative by construction
//!
//! Every band derived from an expansion depends on this module reading a body
//! correctly, so anything short of a single simple command — multiple
//! statements, control flow, substitution, assignment, redirection — is
//! [`ShellWord::Opaque`]: membership yes, grammar no, which grades `Unknown` and
//! spends the model exactly as the pre-grader stack did. When in doubt, opaque.
//!
//! # Known limitation
//!
//! zsh global (`alias -g`) and suffix (`alias -s`) aliases substitute anywhere in
//! a line, not just at the command word, and this head-oriented model does not
//! contemplate them. They are not collected.
