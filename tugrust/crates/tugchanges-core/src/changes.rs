//! The `changes` operation — "which files did this session change?"
//!
//! Reads the session's `file_events` attribution rows from the read-only ledger
//! ([`crate::ledger`]), joins them against the current `git status` so
//! committed/reverted files drop out, dedups per repo-relative path (latest
//! live event wins op/origin), and — with `--diff` — attaches each file's
//! unified diff. Ported from `tugutil/src/commands/changes.rs`.
//!
//! **Invariant ([P01]): a dirty file is never invisible.** `git status
//! --untracked-files=all` is the universe of the shared resolution
//! ([`resolve_changes`]); the ledger *annotates* that universe, it does not
//! *filter* it. Every dirty path is classified into one of three buckets —
//! `attributed` (this session's live rows), `foreign` (only other sessions'
//! live rows), or `unattributed` (no live rows anywhere) — so a capture gap can
//! narrow *attribution* but can never drop a file from `context`. The
//! `changes()` op itself keeps its legacy event-scoped wire contract (only
//! `files`); the buckets surface through `context` ([Q01]).
//!
//! Two per-file rules govern classification:
//!
//! - **Row liveness.** A ledger row is live only while it postdates the last
//!   commit that touched its path ([`min_live_at_ms`]) — a commit *spends* the
//!   rows it absorbs, so a spent row neither attributes nor contends when the
//!   file goes dirty again later. Ties break toward spent, degrading to
//!   `unattributed` — visible, never falsely claimed.
//! - **Contention is computed here at read time, per region.** An attributed
//!   path that other sessions also hold live rows for names them in
//!   `sessions`; it is `shared` only when the owners' claimed regions actually
//!   overlap ([`crate::contention`], [P12]) — and an owner whose evidence
//!   cannot say where it wrote claims the whole file, which reproduces the
//!   file-level answer exactly. Capture never records a cross-session
//!   judgment, and wall-clock overlap between sessions is never evidence.
