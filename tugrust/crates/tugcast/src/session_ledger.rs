//! SessionLedger — sqlite-backed per-session metadata for the tugcast supervisor.
//!
//! One row per claude session. Each row carries the workspace key, project dir,
//! created/last-used timestamps, turn count, first-prompt snippet, lifecycle
//! state, and (when the session is live) the bound card id. The ledger replaces
//! the previous tugbank-backed `sessions` map and `live-sessions` set with a
//! purpose-built store: row-level queries, atomic eviction, indexed lookup by
//! workspace, single source of truth for "is this session live, and where".
//!
//! # State machine
//!
//! `state` is one of `live` | `closed` | `failed`. Allowed transitions:
//!
//! - `INSERT  state="live", card_id=<card_id>` on `spawn_session_ok`.
//! - `UPDATE  state="closed"`                  on `close_session` or tugcode exit.
//! - `UPDATE  state="failed"`                  on `resume_failed` (replaces the previous row-removal).
//! - `DELETE` on cap/age eviction or explicit trash.
//!
//! `card_id` is set when the session first binds to a card and is preserved
//! across the row's lifetime — `mark_closed` and `mark_failed` retain it as
//! the "last bound" record so client-side restore can reconstruct the
//! card↔session mapping after a tugcast restart. Liveness is encoded
//! exclusively in `state`, not by nullity of `card_id`.
//!
//! # Eviction
//!
//! - **Cap per workspace** — `DEV_LEDGER_MAX_PER_WORKSPACE` (20). On
//!   `record_spawn`, the oldest non-live row by `last_used_at` is evicted if
//!   the workspace already holds the cap.
//! - **Age expiry** — `DEV_LEDGER_MAX_AGE_DAYS` (90). Tugcast startup sweeps
//!   any non-live row whose `last_used_at` is older than the cap.
//!
//! Live rows are never evicted by either policy. A long-pinned card keeps its
//! ledger row regardless of age.
//!
//! # Schema
//!
//! Two tables: `sessions` (one row per claude session, lifecycle state
//! and metadata) and `turns` (a *submission journal* — one row per
//! pending user submission, deleted as soon as claude acknowledges).
//! Cascade-on-`sessions`-DELETE for the journal is implemented via the
//! `turns_cascade_delete_on_session` trigger rather than a foreign-key
//! constraint: the supervisor inserts journal rows at user-message
//! dispatch time, before claude emits `session_init` and before the
//! bridge populates the `sessions` row, so an `INSERT`-time FK check
//! would chicken-and-egg. The trigger preserves the user-visible
//! "Trash cascades to journal" contract without coupling INSERT
//! ordering across the dispatch and bridge code paths.
//!
//! Bootstrap creates every table, index, and trigger via
//! `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS`, and additive schema changes ride
//! **self-healing migrations**: idempotent `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN`
//! passes (`migrate_sessions_add_name` and its siblings) that tolerate
//! the duplicate-column race, so an existing on-disk `sessions.db` is
//! upgraded in place on open. There is no `migrations` table and no
//! version counter — per-instance state needs neither, and **never
//! delete the database to "migrate" it**: `minted_tags` and
//! `tag_lineage_points` are append-only arbiters whose loss silently
//! re-opens callsign recycling. (The shared `changes.db` is a different
//! regime entirely — its schema changes bump `CHANGES_SCHEMA_VERSION`
//! with a registered migration.)
//!
//! # Callsigns: permanence, and the one suffix ([D132])
//!
//! Every session wears a mnemonic `adjective-noun` **callsign** in
//! `sessions.tag`. Two rules govern it, and both are load-bearing because
//! commit trailers cite callsigns.
//!
//! **It is never recycled.** `sessions` rows are hard-`DELETE`d — trash, the
//! cascade paths, cap/age eviction — so the `sessions_tag` unique index frees a
//! callsign the moment its row dies, and a recycled callsign would make an old
//! commit's citation resolve to a *different* session: a confidently wrong
//! answer, strictly worse than an unresolvable one. So the arbiter is the
//! append-only **`minted_tags`** table. Every mint path inserts into it in the
//! same transaction as the row it names, its `PRIMARY KEY` violation is the
//! collision signal a mint retries against, and **nothing may ever delete from
//! it** — not trash, not the cascades, not eviction. Deleting rows there
//! silently restores recycling. `sessions_tag` stays only as the live-row
//! invariant. The guarantee is per-ledger: `sessions.db` is per-instance, so a
//! trailer written on another machine simply misses, which is safe.
//!
//! **A collision rerolls; it never suffixes.** The bare `-2`, `-3`… backstop is
//! retired, along with the silent NULL tag it landed on at exhaustion. On a
//! genuine collision the mint rolls a complete fresh pair and re-claims.
//!
//! **The only sanctioned suffix is fork lineage:** `<root>-<Letter><Number>`,
//! the letter naming the rewind point forked from (`A` for the first point ever
//! forked from within a lineage) and the number sequencing forks from that
//! point, extending for a fork of a fork (`stocky-pixie-A1-B2`). Letters and
//! numbers are allocated from **`tag_lineage_points`**, one row per point ever
//! forked from within a root's lineage — a table rather than a query over
//! sibling names, because a query would have to re-derive letters from parsed
//! display strings and a trashed fork would take its number with it. That table
//! is append-only for the same reason `minted_tags` is: a reissued letter or
//! number would make two unrelated forks share a callsign. A colliding lineage
//! candidate **errors rather than rerolling** — a reroll would write an
//! unrelated word pair into `tag` while `root_tag`/`tag_lineage` still named the
//! lineage, a contradiction the client's resolver would render to the user.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! Writes serialize through a single `Mutex<Connection>` inside the ledger.
//! Sqlite runs in WAL mode with a 5-second `busy_timeout`. The supervisor's
//! write cadence — one write per `session_init` / `turn_complete` /
//! `resume_failed` / close — fits comfortably under those settings.
//! Journal writes (`insert_pending_turn`,
//! `delete_oldest_pending_for_session`) are single-statement and don't
//! need explicit transactions; sqlite's per-statement implicit
//! transaction is enough.
