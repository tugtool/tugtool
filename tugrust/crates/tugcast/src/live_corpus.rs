//! Test support for the parity contracts that run against the user's **live**
//! session corpus (`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/`).
//!
//! Those contracts compare two readings of the same files — tugcode's, taken
//! by a subprocess, and the Rust engine's, taken moments later. The corpus is
//! not frozen: a session running while the suite runs grows between the two
//! readings, and the extra records read as a divergence that no code change
//! caused and no code change can fix. A green suite must not depend on the
//! user having no session open.
//!
//! `StillFiles` stamps the directory before the subprocess runs and re-stamps
//! each file after it is read. A file whose mtime moved was in flight; only a
//! still file is a fair comparison. Every live-corpus contract goes through
//! here so the guard cannot be forgotten in a new one.
