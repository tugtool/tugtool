//! Append-only journal for the machine-global changes ledger.
//!
//! Every mutation of the shared `changes.*` tables is appended here as
//! one fsync'd JSON line, under the same ledger mutex as the SQLite
//! apply and immediately after it — so the journal's order is the apply
//! order. A mutation is journaled when it landed (`touched > 0`) **and
//! when its apply failed**: a database degrading mid-run must not
//! swallow the durable record — the post-quarantine rebuild replays
//! exactly the writes the corrupt database refused. Only a no-op apply
//! (a replayed duplicate hitting its `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` key) is
//! skipped, so session replays never bloat the journal. The one window
//! the journal does not cover is a crash between a successful apply and
//! its append — that row exists in the database and is carried by
//! salvage and the `VACUUM INTO` snapshots instead.
//!
//! When the open-time integrity gate quarantines a corrupt `changes.db`,
//! the fresh database is reconstructed as: bootstrap schema → salvage
//! readable rows → **replay this journal**, whose records are idempotent
//! (inserts land on `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` / `INSERT OR REPLACE` keys,
//! deletes re-delete) so re-applying rows the salvage already carried is
//! harmless, and deletes the salvage resurrected are re-applied.
//!
//! The journal lives beside the database (`changes.db.journal.jsonl` for
//! `changes.db`) and is opened **only by the writer-claim owner** — an
//! open rotates an oversized journal to `<name>.old` (one prior
//! generation kept), and rotation is the owner's act alone: a forwarding
//! instance opening it would rename the live owner's file out from under
//! its append fd. The owner opens it only *after* any quarantine replay,
//! so rotation can never empty the very rebuild that needs it. The
//! journal begins at the moment this code first runs on a machine — rows
//! older than it come from salvage and the snapshots, never from here.
