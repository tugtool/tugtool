//! repo_files — resolving and repairing the paths the Operator's file verbs
//! are given.
//!
//! Every path-taking verb hands its argument here before doing any work, and
//! the module exists because of one failure shape: `git grep -e zone --
//! '%design-decisions.md'` exits 1 with empty stdout *and* empty stderr, which
//! the caller's `run_git` correctly reads as "matched nothing", so a scan that
//! never ran and a scan that ran clean are the same result. A model given that
//! result wrote a fluent, false claim that the term is absent from the file.
//!
//! So the rule here is: **a path argument that matches nothing is an error.**
//! Once an unmatched scope cannot come back as `ok, rows=0`, that result
//! acquires exactly one meaning — the file was read and the pattern is not in
//! it — which is the only thing that makes an absence claim defensible.
//!
//! Between "exact" and "nothing" sits a repair ladder, run cheapest-first and
//! only when the literal resolution returned zero:
//!
//! 1. **Literal** — the argument is a real pathspec as written. A pathspec that
//!    names 37 files (`tuglaws/`) or 502 (`*.md`) is *exact*, not ambiguous;
//!    multiplicity only becomes a question when the system is guessing.
//! 2. **LIKE strip** — `%` removed and retried. This is the observed
//!    contamination: `changes.for_path` speaks SQL LIKE and the model carried
//!    its grammar into a git pathspec in the same round. `_` is the other LIKE
//!    wildcard and is deliberately *not* stripped: it is an ordinary character
//!    in real filenames here, so stripping it would break more paths than it
//!    would repair.
//! 3. **Basename glob** — `*<basename>*`, which is what finds
//!    `tuglaws/design-decisions.md` from `design-decisions.md`.
//! 4. **Case-insensitive basename** — some file's name matches ignoring case.
//!
//! Resolution runs against git's view (`ls-files --cached --others
//! --exclude-standard`), which is both what `git grep` will actually search and
//! a cheap, ordered listing of the tree. Untracked-but-not-ignored files are
//! included so a file written minutes ago is findable.
