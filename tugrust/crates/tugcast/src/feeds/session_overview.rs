//! Session overview — a one-line answer to "what is this session working on?",
//! written by the local model and broadcast on PULSE above the live beat.
//!
//! The beat line says what just happened; the overview says what the whole
//! session is *for*. The overview follows the transcript, not the toolbelt: it
//! is composed from the user's own prompts (read from the claude JSONL) and an
//! interleaved stream of everything the transcript shows — assistant prose,
//! tool calls, and Session-card shell commands, in arrival order. Those go to
//! the local model as one digest, and the sentence that comes back is the
//! line. Either half alone is enough — a session that only answers questions
//! is described by its prompts.
//!
//! **One-way, like the pulse bridge.** This module taps the CODE_OUTPUT
//! broadcast and produces exactly two outputs — a PULSE frame and tracing. It
//! reads no client state and answers no requests, so nothing downstream can
//! block a session on it.
//!
//! **It costs nothing when it can't run.** No model, the tenant switched off,
//! PULSE itself switched off, an unresolvable session identity, a refusal — all
//! of them end the tick silently, and the strip renders exactly as it does
//! today.
//!
//! **A settled session says what it did.** When a turn ends — or a `$` command
//! settles cleanly — and nothing follows for `IDLE_COLLAPSE_AFTER`, the emitter
//! runs one last summarize over the whole stretch and the strip switches from
//! the present tense to the past. Leaving the final intent up would be a claim
//! the session has stopped making.
//!
//! The collapse rides the ordinary emit machinery — the same queue, the single
//! in-flight slot, the same back-off, register, and gate — so it inherits every
//! safety property already built rather than duplicating one. It differs in
//! exactly two places, both deliberate: the gate runs in its retrospective mode
//! (see `ground_headline`), and the attempt is marked spent when the model
//! *answers* rather than when a headline emits. The second is not an
//! optimization: the collapse fires on `settled_at`, which no refusal changes,
//! so an attempt marked only on success would be retried on every sweep for as
//! long as the session stayed idle.
//!
//! One retrospective per settled stretch. Any beat resumes ordinary intents and
//! re-arms the next collapse, so nothing is lost — the intent it replaced was
//! stale by the definition of the trigger.
