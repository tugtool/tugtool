//! attribution — file-event capture from the agent-bridge relay loop.
//!
//! Every tool call a session makes flows through one supervised point:
//! tugcast's stdout relay loop in [`super::agent_bridge::relay_session_io`].
//! This module is the parsing + bookkeeping the relay's attribution
//! intercept uses to concentrate a session's file knowledge down to the
//! moment of change — a `file_events` row written when the tool call lands
//! ([P03]–[P06]).
//!
//! Two shapes are recognized on the stream:
//!
//! - **Exact** — `Write` / `Edit` / `MultiEdit` / `NotebookEdit`. The
//!   changed path comes straight from the tool input. Recorded on the
//!   successful `tool_result` (never at `tool_use` time — a denied or
//!   errored call must not pollute the record, [P04]). Because
//!   `tool_result` frames carry only the `tool_use_id` (not the tool name
//!   or input), the relay keeps a [`PendingCalls`] map populated at
//!   `tool_use` time and consumed at `tool_result` time.
//! - **Bash** — the one opaque mutator; handled by the working-tree
//!   fingerprint bracket ([`OpenBracket`]), held relay-local by the relay
//!   loop. A Bash command's *text* is read too ([`declared_ops_for_command`]):
//!   the paths it literally names are proof, exactly as an exact tool's
//!   `file_path` is, so a delta row for a named path is promoted from
//!   correlation to `origin: "cmd"`.
//!
//! The pending map is size-capped with oldest-entry eviction and is
//! deliberately **not** cleared on `turn_complete`: a background agent's
//! child `tool_use`/`tool_result` pair can straddle a turn boundary
//! (`subagent-tail` re-emits child frames on a poll while the parent turn
//! may already be over), and clearing at the boundary would orphan
//! exactly the edits this feature exists to catch.

// Parts of this surface (accessors, diagnostic helpers) are consumed only
// by tests; suppress dead-code warnings the same way `session_ledger.rs`
// and the rest of the crate do.
