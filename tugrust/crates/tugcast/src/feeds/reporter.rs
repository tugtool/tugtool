//! reporter — the live GAZETTE bridge: taps the wires a session's work

//! answers into a ledger row and a broadcast frame.

//!   CODE_OUTPUT ──allowlist tap──▶ per-session FrameBuffer ─┐
//!   CODE_INPUT submissions ──────▶ (same buffers)           ├─ wake ──▶ reporter-post

//!
//! Everything about *what* a wake means lives in [`super::reporter_wake`],
//! which the offline replay harness drives too — that shared core is why the
//! cadence tuned against real transcripts is the cadence that ships. This
//! module is the tokio half: subscriptions, timers, the pool call, the ledger,
//! and the wire.
//!
//! ## Two failures that must not look alike
//!
//! A wake can end in silence for two entirely different reasons. The model can
//! read the window and decide there is nothing worth telling — that is the
//! channel working, and the frames are spent. Or the job can fail: a dead
//! worker, a timeout, no `claude` on the machine. Then nobody read the window
//! at all, and dropping it would silently lose a stretch of real work. So a
//! failed job puts its window back at the front of the session's buffer
//! (bounded by the same caps) and logs a distinct warning. The two are
//! separated again at the parse: an envelope that would not parse is not the
//! model choosing silence either, and it says so in the log.
//!
//! One-way isolation ([P12]): nothing here writes toward any work session, and
//! the Gazette's own frames travel on `GAZETTE`, a feed this module never
//! subscribes to — a post can therefore never become evidence for the next
//! post.
