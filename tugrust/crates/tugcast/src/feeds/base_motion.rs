//! base_motion — replay a dash onto its base the moment the base moves.
//!
//! The doctrine is that a landing problem should surface when it becomes true,
//! not when someone tries to land. So this watches for the base moving and, when
//! it is safe, moves the dash's rounds onto the new tip; the library half
//! (`tugdash_core::replay_onto`) does the moving and this decides *whether*.
//!
//! ## What wakes it
//!
//! Nothing new watches the filesystem. Each workspace already runs exactly one
//! `FileWatcher`, and `git_watch::run_git_workspace_watch` already broadcasts a
//! `GitHeadSignal` on the registry's shared GIT_HEAD channel whenever that
//! workspace's HEAD moves. This engine is one more subscriber to that channel.
//!
//! A signal is an *edge*, though: the git watch baselines `last_head` when its
//! task starts and speaks only on a move past it. A dash that was already behind
//! when tugcast started would therefore never be signalled about. So the engine
//! also **sweeps** — at startup, and whenever the registry opens a workspace it
//! has not seen. A sweep is a wake with no signal attached and runs the same
//! path; behindness is read from refs either way, so the two cannot disagree.
//!
//! The third wake is a turn ending. The common shape of this whole problem is
//! "the base moved while an agent was mid-turn on the dash," and the gate below
//! refuses to act mid-turn — so the supervisor hands the engine each session id
//! as its turn closes, and a dash parked behind it replays seconds later instead
//! of waiting for an unrelated commit.
//!
//! ## The decision is separate from the wiring
//!
//! [`decide_for_dash`] is pure — the gate and the choice of action expressed
//! over plain inputs, with no channels, no git, and no clock — following
//! `reporter_wake.rs`. Every case in the gate is then a table test rather than a
//! server that has to be stood up and driven into the right state.
