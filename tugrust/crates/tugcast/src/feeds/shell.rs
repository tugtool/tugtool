//! Shell feed — per-card block-oriented shell execution.
//!
//! The `$` route runs commands against a real shell and threads each
//! command/output exchange into the Dev transcript. This module is the
//! tugcast side: it consumes `SHELL_INPUT` (0x61) frames from the deck and
//! emits `SHELL_OUTPUT` (0x60) frames tagged with the card's `tug_session_id`.
//!
//! # Model (probe: `crates/tugcast/probes/shell-exec/FINDINGS.md`)
//!
//! Each card session owns a **long-lived POSIX-shell child in pipe mode** (no
//! PTY / no controlling TTY), driven by a **sentinel protocol**: after each
//! command the service writes a sentinel emitter, then reads the merged
//! stdout+stderr stream until the sentinel line, which carries the command's
//! exit code and post-command cwd. Pipe mode makes `isatty()` false, so
//! pagers and TUIs self-disable; a hardened env (`PAGER`/`GIT_PAGER`=cat,
//! `TERM=dumb`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`) and a per-command `</dev/null`
//! redirect close the remaining hang vectors. A genuine long-runner wedges the
//! shell (it blocks on the foreground command), so cancellation cannot be
//! another write — it must **signal the process group** (SIGTERM→SIGKILL),
//! which the dispatcher does out-of-band via the shared pid.
//!
//! The child is the **user's own shell, spawned interactive-login** (`$SHELL
//! -il`), so it sources their startup files — PATH, exports, aliases,
//! functions — and the `$` route feels like their terminal rather than a bare
//! shell. A post-startup preamble then neutralizes the interactive baggage
//! (prompt paint, precmd/preexec hooks, and the SIGTERM-ignore that would
//! defeat the reap) and a discarded warmup exchange absorbs any rc chatter. A
//! profile that hangs or fails the warmup can never brick the route: the child
//! is reaped and a plain rc-less shell takes its place, flagged in the next
//! exchange's output.
//!
//! # Scope + lifecycle
//!
//! One shell child per `tug_session_id`, lazily spawned on the first `exec`
//! in the card's project dir. The child does NOT survive a tugcast restart;
//! it restarts fresh on the next `exec` (the transcript *record* persists via
//! the ledger, not the live process). A `kill` (or per-exchange timeout)
//! reaps the process group and the session respawns on the next `exec`.
