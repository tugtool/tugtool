//! The facts-library's pure core: what a fact *is*, how one reads, and how a
//! command's settled output becomes a test result.
//!
//! Three rules govern everything here, and all three exist to keep two
//! surfaces from describing the same event two ways.
//!
//! **One rendering per fact.** [`render_text`] is the only place a fact
//! becomes a sentence. Its output is stored in `facts.text`, which is what the
//! FTS index covers *and* what the Reporter's SETTLED FACTS wake section
//! prints. Search and narration cannot disagree about what a fact says,
//! because there is nothing for them to disagree with.
//!
//! **Timid classifiers.** [`classify_test_run`] recognizes three runners and
//! refuses everything else. A recognized runner whose output tail cannot be
//! parsed records `unknown` with no counts. A guessed pass count reads exactly
//! like a real one and is worse than an honest refusal — the `shell_ops`
//! posture, applied to test output.
//!
//! **Harness parity.** The live recorders and `gazette_replay`'s harness both
//! compose their facts here. A calibration read is only meaningful if the
//! facts the harness synthesizes are the facts production records, and the way
//! to guarantee that is to have one implementation rather than two that agree
//! today.
//!
//! Nothing in this module touches IO, a clock, or a database.
