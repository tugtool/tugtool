//! SharedAgent — an app-scoped pool of persistent, job-constrained `claude`
//! workers ([P01], [P02]).
//!
//! A `SharedAgent` is a model operated against a **fixed table of named jobs**,
//! not a general-purpose model handle: callers ask for a job by name and hand
//! it an input, and there is no API that accepts an arbitrary prompt ([P01]).
//! Adding a capability means adding a [`JobSpec`], which is reviewed like any
//! other contract change; standing up a second agent on a different model means
//! constructing a second [`AgentSpec`], not writing new machinery.
//!
//! Workers are **persistent** because a cold `claude` spawn costs more than the
//! whole latency budget of the job that would be waiting on it — measured at
//! 2327 ms for the first turn against 867–989 ms for every turn after it (CLI
//! 2.1.222, `claude-haiku-4-5`). One warm process therefore serves many turns,
//! recycled by turn count and reaped when idle ([P04]).
//!
//! Which means **nobody waits on a cold start**. A job whose ceiling is shorter
//! than one is never handed a worker that has not answered yet: its turn
//! becomes that worker's warmup and the caller degrades immediately. The lane
//! is otherwise brought up ahead of any caller — by `ensure_warm`, called on
//! traffic that precedes the job — and kept up across a recycle by warming the
//! replacement before the old worker stops answering.
//!
//! Every turn is self-contained ([P05]): the job's full instructions ride each
//! message and the model is told to answer only from it, so any turn can be a
//! worker's first and a recycle costs nothing but a spawn.
//!
//! The test seam is [`AgentWorkerSpawner`] (the `ScribeSpawner` / `ChildSpawner`
//! pattern): production spawns the persistent child, tests script turn outcomes
//! and never assert model prose.

You label one line a developer typed into a dev tool. Answer with exactly one word and nothing else: SHELL or PROMPT.

The first word of the line ALWAYS names a real program installed on this machine. The question is never whether the program exists — only whether the person meant to RUN it, or was writing a sentence to an AI assistant that happens to begin with that word.

SHELL — they meant to run the program. Anything after the first word is an argument to it: a file name, a directory, a flag, a path, or a subcommand.

PROMPT — they were writing to the assistant. The line reads as English prose: it contains an article, a pronoun, a preposition, or it asks a question.

The two mistakes are not equal. A wrong SHELL runs a command nobody asked for and cannot be taken back. A wrong PROMPT costs one keystroke to retype. When the line could be read either way, answer PROMPT.

If the words after the first read as arguments — a subcommand it lists, a flag, a file, a path, a value — answer SHELL. Documentation is never complete: a flag or subcommand missing from it, or spelled a little wrong, is still someone running the program. Judge the SHAPE of what follows, not whether every token appears above.

If the words after the first read as English about the program — a request, a question, a description of what to do — answer PROMPT. The giveaway is that the documentation gives those words no meaning at all.

You write the standing description of a coding session — ONE sentence saying what the whole session is about. It sits under the session's name, on the line under it a headline says what the session is doing this minute, and it is read days later, so it must still be true then.

The digest comes in labeled sections, and they are not equal.

\"What the session set out to do\" and \"What it turned to after that\" are THE SUBJECT. Together they are the session: where it started and how far it has moved. Describe the undertaking those add up to — if the session began in one place and turned, say the thing that covers both, not the newest half.

\"Where it stands right now\" is BACKGROUND. It is there so you know the work is live and what it currently touches. It is never the subject. The line above yours already says it, and a description that repeats it says nothing.

\"The description you are revising\" is your own last answer. If it is still true, stay close to it — change it only as much as the newer evidence requires. This line is supposed to stand.

Write it as a sentence, not as a headline:

START WITH A VERB, in the plain command form: Rework, Repair, Trace, Port, Audit, Bundle, Investigate, Extend. Not \"Fixing\", not \"Working on\" — Rework, Repair.
ARTICLES AND CONJUNCTIONS ARE ALLOWED. \"the\", \"a\", \"and\" — use them where the sentence wants them. This is the one line that gets to read as English.
NAME THE WORK AND ITS REACH: what is being done, and to what — the subsystem, the surfaces, the span. That second half is what makes it a description rather than a title.
ROOM FOR ABOUT 110 CHARACTERS — one sentence, no second sentence.
SENTENCE CASE. Proper names keep their capitals — Lens, Finder, Keychain, CodeMirror.
No period at the end. No quotes.
