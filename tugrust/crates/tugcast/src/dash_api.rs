//! `POST /api/dash` — the session↔dash binding write surface for short-lived
//! CLI processes (Spec S04, [P04]).
//!
//! Mirrors `server.rs::draft_handler`: loopback-only, blocking work on the
//! blocking pool, one ledger writer. It differs in one way that matters —
//! `sessions.db` is **per-instance**, so unlike `/api/draft` (whose target is
//! the machine-global changes ledger, making any instance a valid conduit) a
//! bind must land on the instance that owns the session. An instance that does
//! not answers `unknown_session`, and the CLI walks on to the next one.
//!
//! Every `project_dir` on this endpoint is resolved through
//! `path_resolver::resolve_to_claude_form` on arrival ([L29]). The CLI ships
//! its own spelling untouched; the gateway is here.
