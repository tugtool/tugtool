//! Feed trait definitions for tugcast
//!
//! This module defines two types of feeds:
//! - StreamFeed: Continuous data streams (e.g., terminal output) using broadcast channels
//! - SnapshotFeed: Point-in-time snapshots (e.g., current state) using watch channels
//!
//! Feeds are **run-once owned tasks**: `run` consumes the boxed feed, so the
//! type system enforces single-run semantics (no runtime "already running"
//! guards, no `Mutex<Option<Receiver>>` take-patterns). A feed self-describes
//! its router registration — id, name, lag policy, channel capacity — so the
//! router can create the channel, record the policy, and spawn the task from
//! the boxed trait object alone.

/// A feed that produces a continuous stream of frames
///
/// StreamFeeds use broadcast channels to send frames to multiple subscribers.
/// Each frame is delivered to all active subscribers. This is suitable for
/// high-throughput continuous data like terminal output.
///
/// The `#[async_trait]` macro is required because the feed router needs to store
/// feeds as `Box<dyn StreamFeed>`, which requires object safety. Native async fn
/// in traits is not object-safe in Rust.
