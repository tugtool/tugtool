# xcodebuild-quiet.sh — run xcodebuild and report only what a human needs.
#
# xcodebuild writes ~800 lines for a build that has nothing to say: a
# phase header plus the full indented invocation for every SwiftDriver /
# SwiftCompile / CompileC / Ld / CodeSign step. None of it is signal
# unless something failed, and all of it buries the warnings that are.
#
# So: capture the stream, and on success print only the lines that carry
# information — warnings, errors, linker complaints, and the BUILD
# banner. On failure, print the whole log, because that is exactly when
# every one of those 800 lines might matter.
#
# TUG_BUILD_STREAM=1 passes the raw stream through untouched, the same
# escape hatch TUG_APPTEST_STREAM gives the app-test harness.
#
# Usage:
#   xcodebuild-quiet.sh <label> <xcodebuild args...>
#
# <label> names the build in the summary line (e.g. "Tug-debug.app").
