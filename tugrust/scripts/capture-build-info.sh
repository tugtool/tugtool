# capture-build-info.sh — xcodebuild build-phase script
#
# Bakes build-time identity into the built bundle's Info.plist so the
# running app can read its own identity without any runtime git lookup
# or shared bootstrap state. See roadmap/tug-multi-instance.md [D01]
# [D02] [D03] for the design rationale.
#
# Writes (always):
#   BuildProfile      "debug" (Debug) or "release" (Release)
#   BuildBranch       git branch at build time, or "detached-<sha8>"
#                     if HEAD is detached
#   BuildCommit       full SHA-1 of HEAD at build time (diagnostic)
#
# Writes (debug builds only; release omits per [D03] [D19]):
#   BuildSourceTree   absolute path to the repo root the bundle was
#                     built from
#
# Required env (set by Xcode at build time):
#   CONFIGURATION             Debug | Release
#   SRCROOT                   path to tugapp/ (containing the .xcodeproj)
#   TARGET_BUILD_DIR          parent directory of the built bundle
#   CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH      e.g. "Tug.app/Contents"
#
# Marked alwaysOutOfDate in the Xcode build phase so it re-runs on
# every build — BUILD_BRANCH can change between builds with no other
# source-file changes, and a stale cache would lie about identity.
