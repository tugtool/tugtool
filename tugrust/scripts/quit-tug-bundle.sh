# Quit a running Tug.app by bundle ID and wait for it to actually
# exit, then send a final teardown to the matching tugcast in the
# registry as a safety net.
#
# Used by `just app-dev`, `just app-prod`, `just launch-dev`,
# `just launch-prod`, `just stop-dev`, `just stop-prod` so each
# (profile, branch) launch starts from a clean slate — no stale GUI
# process kept alive by macOS LaunchServices when `open` is called.
#
# Usage:
#   quit-tug-bundle.sh <bundle-id> <instance-id> [--timeout SECONDS]
#
# The Tug.app process responds to `osascript ... quit` by invoking
# its `applicationShouldTerminate` handler, which signals tugcast
# over the control socket and kills its process group. The registry
# `instance stop` call is the belt-and-suspenders for the case where
# the GUI process is unresponsive (panic, hung WebView, etc.).

# 1. Ask the GUI app to quit. AppleScript's `quit` sends a graceful
#    NSApp shutdown via Apple Events; the app's
#    `applicationShouldTerminate` runs and the bundle exits when
#    teardown completes. If the app isn't running, osascript returns
#    a non-zero error which we suppress.

# 2. Poll until no process for this bundle remains. `pgrep -f` looks
#    in each process's full command line; Tug.app processes carry
#    the bundle path there. We match the bundle ID inside the path
#    (e.g. "...Tug.app/Contents/MacOS/Tug" + the bundle id appears
#    in `lsappinfo`-style metadata that pgrep doesn't see, so we
#    use `lsappinfo find` which IS reliable per bundle id).
