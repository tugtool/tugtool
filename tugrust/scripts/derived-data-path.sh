# Resolve the per-variant Xcode DerivedData path for the current working
# directory's Tug build identity. Parallel to `product-name-from-cwd.sh`
# and `bundle-id-from-cwd.sh`.
#
# Xcode's *default* DerivedData location is keyed on the `.xcodeproj`
# path, so every build variant of the same project shares one build
# directory — and since they are all the same `Tug` target, building one
# `PRODUCT_NAME` (e.g. `Tug-apptest`) evicts the previously-built product
# of another (`Tug-debug.app`), and vice-versa. Giving each variant its
# own `-derivedDataPath` keeps their build outputs disjoint so an
# app-test build never clobbers a live `app-debug` bundle.
#
# The path is keyed on PRODUCT_NAME (which already encodes the variant
# and honors `TUG_FORCE_BUNDLE_ID`). Forced-identity builds (app-test)
# additionally key on the worktree's branch slug: every worktree builds
# `Tug-apptest.app` under the SAME bundle id (so the one AX/TCC grant —
# keyed on the path-independent designated requirement — covers them
# all), but each worktree gets its own build directory so a build or
# re-sign in one worktree can never clobber the bundle another
# worktree's app-test run is executing.

#                             (e.g. Tug-apptest-main, Tug-apptest-tugdash-foo)
