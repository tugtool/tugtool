# assign-bundle-id.sh — xcodebuild build-phase script
#
# Assigns the bundle's CFBundleIdentifier per (BuildProfile, BuildBranch)
# according to roadmap/tug-multi-instance.md [D10] (suffix scheme as
# amended by [D19]):
#
#   (release, main)       → dev.tugtool.app
#   (debug, main)         → dev.tugtool.app.debug
#   (debug, <other>)      → dev.tugtool.app.debug-<slug>
#   (release, <other>)    → dev.tugtool.app.release-<slug>
#
# Where <slug> is the BuildBranch normalized via
# `tugrust/scripts/branch-slug.sh` (the canonical bash implementation
# of the slug algorithm). Parity with the Swift `BranchSlug.compute`
# is verified by `tests/build-info/test-slug-parity.sh`.
#
# Per [D19]: the rename from production/development → release/debug
# invalidates the user's existing AX (Accessibility) TCC grant on the
# old `(development, main)` shorthand `dev.tugtool.app.dev`. The new
# `(debug, main)` bundle ID `dev.tugtool.app.debug` prompts for AX on
# first launch — one-time cost, accepted. The orphan TCC entry on
# `dev.tugtool.app.dev` is harmless and can be cleared manually via
# `tccutil reset Accessibility dev.tugtool.app.dev`. The
# `(release, main)` bundle ID `dev.tugtool.app` is unchanged, so its
# AX grant survives.
#
# Required env (set by Xcode at build time):
#   TARGET_BUILD_DIR          parent directory of the built bundle
#   CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH      e.g. "Tug.app/Contents"
#
# Preconditions: capture-build-info.sh has already run and populated
# BuildProfile + BuildBranch in the bundle's Info.plist.
#
# Postcondition: the bundle's CFBundleIdentifier reflects the
# (BuildProfile, BuildBranch) tuple per [D10]. Code-signing (which
# happens after this phase) reads CFBundleIdentifier from the bundle's
# Info.plist directly, so the dynamic value propagates to the signed
# binary's designated requirement automatically.
#
# Note on PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER: the xcconfig setting in
# project.pbxproj stays at the legacy `dev.tugtool.app` value. It is
# no longer the source of truth — this script is. Xcode IDE Build runs
# the same build phases as `xcodebuild`, so the dynamic override
# applies in both paths. The pbxproj value is the fallback that
# Xcode's `application-identifier` xcent generation uses; for our
# bundle (no sandbox, no app groups, no keychain access groups) a
# stale `application-identifier` in the xcent is cosmetic only.
