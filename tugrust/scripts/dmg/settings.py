# Tug.dmg: the app icon on the left, an /Applications symlink on the right,
# the arrow and "Drag Tug to Applications" caption painted into the retina
# background, all Finder chrome hidden. Coordinates follow the plan's DMG
# geometry (720x460 content area, origin top-left, icon centers).

#     "<Volume Name>" <output.dmg>
# The volume name and output path are dmgbuild's two positional arguments;
# everything else arrives through -D defines so a nightly build can reuse this
# file with a different staged app and volume name.
