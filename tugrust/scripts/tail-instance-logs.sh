# Tail one instance's newest logs — tugcast's and, when it exists, the app's.
#
# The newest file is picked by modification time rather than by computing
# today's date. Both writers name their files for the UTC day
# (`tracing_appender::rolling::daily` on the Rust side, `TugLog` on the Swift
# side), so an evening run west of Greenwich that computed a local date opened
# a name nothing was writing to and reported no log against a running instance.
# Sorting by mtime removes the timezone question entirely.
#
# The app log is optional: a bundle built before `TugLog` landed writes only
# the tugcast half, and that still tails.
