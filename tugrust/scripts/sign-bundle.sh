# sign-bundle.sh — inside-out signing for Tug.app with per-binary
# entitlements per [D16] of roadmap/tug-multi-instance.md.
#
# Replaces the `codesign --deep --force --sign` pattern that used to
# live in build-app.sh and Justfile recipes. `--deep` is FORBIDDEN
# for signing in this codebase because it applies the same
# entitlements file (or no entitlements) to every nested binary —
# wrong for our bundle shape, where the bun-compiled `tugcode`
# binary needs permissive JIT-related entitlements that the Rust
# helpers and the outer Swift binary explicitly should not have.
#
# `--deep` remains valid for *verification* commands (`codesign --verify
# --deep --strict ...`); it's only the signing form that's banned.
#
# Signing order is strictly inside-out, per Apple's guidance for any
# bundle with heterogeneous nested binaries (macOS 13+):
#
#   1. Rust helpers (tugcast, tug, tugexec, tugrelaunch, tugbank)
#      — default hardened runtime, no custom entitlements file.
#   2. Swift debug dylibs (`Tug.debug.dylib`, `__preview.dylib` —
#      Debug builds only). Hardened runtime requires nested dylibs
#      to share the Team ID of the loading binary, so we re-sign
#      Xcode's ad-hoc-signed dylibs with our Developer ID.
#   3. `tugcode` (bun-compiled) — permissive entitlements via
#      `tugapp/tugcode.entitlements`.
#   4. (Future: nested frameworks like Sparkle.framework would slot in
#      here, before the outer .app is sealed.)
#   5. The outer Tug binary + bundle wrapper — minimal entitlements
#      via `tugapp/Tug.entitlements`. This is the final seal; it
#      records the hashes of every signed item beneath it.
#
# Usage:
#   sign-bundle.sh <APP_PATH> [<IDENTITY>]
#
# IDENTITY defaults to the first "Developer ID Application" line
# returned by `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` — see
# #apple-prereqs in the plan for the one-time keychain setup that
# installs the certificate.
