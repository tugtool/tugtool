# Tugplug Plugin Guidelines

## Skills

The plugin ships **agentless, main-loop-driven** skills — there are no sub-agents.

**Plan lifecycle:**

- **`devise`** — author an implementation plan in-thread against the
  devise skeleton (`tuglaws/devise-skeleton.md`). Writes to an explicit path
  (no assumed directory).
- **`implement`** — drive a plan to a tested debug build on an isolated `tugutil dash`
  worktree, committing per step, stopping for review before merge. Walks a single step,
  a step range, or the whole plan, tracked via the plan's Step Status Ledger.
  *(was `bake`; before that the old multi-agent `implement`.)*
- **`dash`** — quick, plan-less worktree-isolated task, same agentless model as
  `implement` but without a plan.

**Assessment & commit:**

- **`vet`** — pre-implementation: assess a plan (or step range) against the tuglaws
  and the real code, then rule "fixups needed" or "clear to implement". Read-only.
- **`audit`** — post-implementation: audit the built code (or step range) against the
  tuglaws and the real diff, then rule "fixups needed" or "good shape". Read-only.
- **`commit`** — analyze the working changes, stage deliberately, and make a clean
  conventional commit immediately (no confirmation prompt).

The lifecycle skills run in the main conversation and ride the `tugutil dash` CLI
(`create` → `commit` per step/round → `join`). The flow is
`/tugplug:devise` → `/tugplug:vet` → `/tugplug:implement` (or just `/tugplug:dash`) →
`/tugplug:audit` → review → `tugutil dash join`.

**Location discipline (critical):** no skill assumes a plan directory — `roadmap/`,
`.tugtool/`, and any other home are never hardcoded. A plan is always an explicit
path; the working root is derived from that path and from `tugutil dash create`'s
worktree response. Once a worktree exists it is the **only** working root — every
operation uses an absolute path into it, and nothing (code, plan, ledger) is written
to the base checkout until `tugutil dash join`.

The old multi-agent orchestration — a swarm of clarifier/author/critic/conformance/
overviewer/architect/coder/committer/reviewer/auditor/dash agents — has been fully
retired: no sub-agents, no per-step tugstate database, no inter-agent JSON contracts.
Every agent is gone.

## Plan Mode Policy

**DO NOT automatically enter Plan mode.** Never use `EnterPlanMode` unless the user
explicitly asks for it. Just do the work directly.
