# Strip the filter off a piped `just app-test*` run, or deny it if it cannot be
# stripped cleanly.
#
# The recipe already renders a report: a per-file result table, a `Diagnostics:`
# section, a `Failures:` section carrying each failure's message and location,
# and a closing `VERDICT:` line. A green one-file run is about twenty lines.
# There is nothing to extract that the summary has not already extracted.
#
# The pipe is not merely redundant. It replaces the recipe's exit code with the
# filter's, so `just app-test X | grep -A 8 "Failures:"` on a passing run prints
# nothing and exits 1 — a green run reported as a silent failure. A fixed `-A N`
# also truncates the second failure and drops `Diagnostics:` entirely.
#
# The judgment is per command, not per command line. A shell line is split into
# top-level segments at `&&`, `||`, `;`, and newline, and only the segments that
# *are* an app-test invocation are judged. `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build | tail
# -3 && cd .. && just app-test X` is left alone: that pipe belongs to the build,
# and the app-test run is already bare. A segment whose own output is filtered
# has the filter removed in place and the rest of the chain is preserved.
#
# Denying costs a round trip every time the reflex fires, so the deny is the last
# resort: it is reached only when an app-test segment feeds something this cannot
# rewrite (a subshell, a command substitution, a redirect into a file).
#
# Machine-readable output has its own channel: TUG_APPTEST_JSON=<path> writes a
# document serialized from the same arrays the summary renders.
#
# Anything unexpected — no jq — exits 0 and falls through to the normal
# permission flow: a broken gate must never block work.
