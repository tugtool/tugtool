## What this is

`dash-join` is the **dash lane's landing gesture** — the twin of `/commit` on the main lane. A dash has been worked (by `/tugplug:dash-implement` or `/tugplug:dash-run`), the user has vetted the build, and this run lands it: preview the merge in memory, land the squash onto the base branch with the dash's join draft as the message, tear down the worktree + branch, clear the draft, and report.

**You do not decide whether to land.** The user invoked this skill; that invocation is the byline. Your job is to land it correctly, or to stop with a clear reading of why it cannot land yet.

Every git operation goes through **`tugutil dash join`**. Never `git merge`, never `git cherry-pick`, never a hand-rolled squash — the CLI owns the preflight, the in-memory preview, the journal, the trailers, and the teardown.

## Input grammar

`/tugplug:dash-join [name] [message…]`

- `/tugplug:dash-join <name>` — land the dash `<name>` with its maintained join draft.
- `/tugplug:dash-join` — bare. Resolve the dash (see below), then land it.
- `/tugplug:dash-join <name> <message…>` — land with `<message>` instead of the draft. Use only when the user typed a message; never invent one to pass here.

## Resolving the dash

```bash
tugutil dash list --json
```

- **Exactly one active dash** and no name given → that's the one.
- **Several** and no name given → `AskUserQuestion` with the candidates (name + description + rounds). Do not guess.
- **None** → report that there is nothing to join and stop.
- **A name that isn't in the list** → report it and show the list; do not fuzzy-match it onto a neighbor.

## Where you run from

`tugutil dash join` must run from the **base checkout's repo root** — it refuses from inside the dash worktree, and it refuses when the repo root is not on the dash's base branch. If the working directory is inside a dash worktree, run the join with an explicit `cd <repo-root> && tugutil dash join …` (absolute path). Never `cd` into the worktree for a join.

## The message it will land

The squash message is, in order: an explicit `--message`, else the dash's maintained **join draft**.

```bash
tugutil draft show --owner dash:<name>
```

- **A draft exists** → that is the message. Show it in your report before landing.
- **No draft** → **stop.** Report that the dash has no join draft, and print the command that writes one, on its own line and inside backticks so the Session card renders it as a clickable chip:

  `` `tugutil draft set --owner dash:<name> --message "<subject + rounds digest>"` ``

  Do **not** compose the message yourself, and do not let the join fall through to the bare dash description. Message authorship needs the working context — what the rounds did and why — which the working skill has and this gesture does not; a message invented from log lines is exactly the durable lie the draft machinery exists to prevent. Whoever worked the dash writes the draft; this gesture lands it.

## Beat 1 — preview

```bash
tugutil dash join <name> --preview --json
```

The preview runs the merge in memory (`git merge-tree`) and touches nothing. Read the result:

- **Clean** → go to beat 2.
- **Conflicts** → report every conflicted path plus the message that would have landed, and **stop**. Do not land, and do not run the resolution ladder on your own initiative. Offer the two real next steps: `--resolve` (the conflict-resolution ladder — replay probe, rerere, re-merge, structured-merge driver — which then lands the result), or resolving by hand on the dash worktree and re-running the join. Run `tugutil dash join <name> --resolve` only when the user says to.

Preflight refusals come back as errors from this same command — surface them verbatim and stop:

- *"Cannot join from inside the dash worktree"* → re-run from the repo root.
- *"repo root worktree is on branch 'X' but dash targets 'Y'"* → the user checks out the base branch; do not switch branches for them.
- *"the base worktree has uncommitted changes to files this dash also changed (…)"* → the preflight is intersection-aware, so only the named files block. Report them and let the user commit or stash. Never stash, reset, or check out on their behalf.
- *"Nothing to join: dash '<name>' has no commits past '<base>'. Release it to discard."* → the dash is empty. Report it and offer release as the user's call. **Never run `tugutil dash release` yourself** — release is the one irreversible act in the workflow, and it belongs to the user's own gesture.

## Beat 2 — land

```bash
tugutil dash join <name>
```

Squash-merges `tugdash/<name>` into its base and tears down the worktree + branch. Never pass `--strategy merge` or `--strategy rebase` — squash is the lane's one strategy; the others are expert CLI paths the user drives themselves.

- A join interrupted mid-teardown (the command reports the journal) resumes with `tugutil dash join <name> --continue`. Run that; it is the resume, not a retry.
- A non-preview join that hits conflicts exits non-zero with the working tree already restored. Report the paths; the options are the same two as beat 1.

## After a successful land

1. **Clear the join draft** — join drafts are keyed by reusable dash names, so an uncleaned draft haunts the *next* dash of the same name as a clobber-protected message describing work that already landed:
   ```bash
   tugutil draft clear --owner dash:<name>
   ```
2. **Read the receipt back** — `tugutil log --limit 1` on the base branch shows the squash commit that landed. Report its hash and subject.

## Report

- The dash, its base branch, and the number of rounds it carried.
- The message that landed, as landed.
- The squash commit hash + subject.
- Teardown: worktree and branch removed; draft cleared.
- Any warnings the CLI emitted (a worktree it could not remove, a branch it could not delete) — verbatim, not paraphrased.

On a stop instead of a land, report what blocked it, the exact CLI message, and the one next step that unblocks it.

## Guardrails

- **`tugutil dash join` does the git.** No `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`, `git checkout`, `git stash`, or `git reset` — not to prepare the join, not to recover from one.
- **Never compose the landing message.** No draft is a stop, not a prompt to write one.
- **Never release.** `tugutil dash release` discards work; it is the user's gesture and never yours, including on the "nothing to join" path.
- **Preview before landing, always** — even when the user names the dash and the message. Beat 1 shows exactly what beat 2 does.
- **Never resolve conflicts unasked.** `--resolve` rewrites the merge result; it runs on the user's word.
- **Squash only.**
- **Don't edit the tree.** This skill lands what exists; it does not fix a build, a test, or a lint on the way through. A dash that isn't ready goes back to `/tugplug:dash-run` or `/tugplug:dash-implement`.
- **No AI attribution in the landed message. Ever.**
