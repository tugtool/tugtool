description: Analyze recent work, stage relevant files, and create a git commit with a clear, informative commit message.

You are a precise git commit specialist. Your job is to analyze recent work, stage the relevant files, compose a clear commit message, and create the commit — immediately, without asking for confirmation.

**CRITICAL: DO NOT ask the user to confirm the commit message or approve the commit. DO NOT present the message and wait for approval. The user invoked `/tugplug:commit` specifically because they want a commit made NOW. Compose the message and run `tug commit` in a single flow. Any hesitation or confirmation prompt is a bug.**

## Scope of Changes (read first)

**Default: commit ONLY the files you changed in this session.** Other edits in the working tree are almost always inflight work the user has not finished — staging them would bundle unrelated changes into one commit. So unless told otherwise, commit only the files that *this conversation* created or modified, and leave everything else untouched. In your report, note that other working-tree changes were left as inflight on the current branch.

**Override — "commit everything":** if the arguments to the skill ask for all changes (e.g. "commit everything", "everything", "all changes", "stage all", "whole working tree"), then commit every relevant working-tree change instead — still excluding anything that looks like a secret, credential, or stray temp file. When committing everything, pass the full path set to `tug commit --paths …` and let your message reflect the full set of changes, not just this session's.

When the arguments are silent on scope, the default (session-only) applies — do not ask which one; just scope to this session's files.

### One command for context — `tug context`

Do not reconstruct "the files I changed this session" from conversation memory as the
primary source — that memory is reliable for `Write`/`Edit` but blind to `Bash`-mediated
edits (`sed`, `perl`, `git mv`, redirection). And do not hand-run raw git — `tug` owns
git changes & commits. Gather everything you need to compose the message in **one command**:

```
tug context --json
```

One clean command — no `cd`, no heredoc, no port discovery, no raw git. It reads the
file-event rows tugcast recorded at the moment of each change (exact for
Write/Edit/NotebookEdit, working-tree-bracketed for Bash) for `$TUG_SESSION_ID`, joins them
against the current `git status`, and returns the session's changed files (each **with its
diff**), the branch/head, and the recent commit subjects — everything the message needs:

```jsonc
{ "session": "…", "project": "…", "repo_root": "…", "branch": "main", "head": "abc1234",
  "files": [ { "path": "tugdeck/src/foo.ts", "op": "edit", "origin": "exact",
               "ambiguous": false, "git_status": " M", "diff": "…unified diff…" } ],
  "recent_commits": [ { "sha": "abc1234", "subject": "…" } ] }
```

- **`files`** is the authoritative "which files" list; each carries a **`diff`** (a created
  file gets a real add-diff), so you read *what* changed without a separate `git diff`.
- **`recent_commits`** is the message-style reference — follow the existing subject style.
- **`ambiguous: true`** means an overlapping session had a Bash bracket open on this repo at
  the same time, so the file's ownership is uncertain. `tug commit` **excludes**
  ambiguous files by default. Do not auto-include one — call it out in your report and
  include it (via `--paths`) only if the diff clearly shows it as this session's work.
- The `files` list already excludes files committed or reverted since (the `git status`
  join), so every listed path is a live change.
- **Fallback:** if `tug context` exits non-zero (older tugcast, or `$TUG_SESSION_ID`
  unset — it prints a hint on stderr), reconstruct the file list from this conversation's
  Write/Edit/Bash calls and inspect the working tree with `tug diff --json`, then commit
  with an explicit `tug commit --paths <files> --message "<m>"` (an explicit `--paths`
  set needs no session).

## Your Process

1. **Gather Context**
   - Run `tug context --json` — the single source for *which* files this session changed,
     *what* changed in each (the per-file `diff`), the branch/head, and the recent-commit
     style to follow. No raw `git status`/`git diff`/`git log` needed.
   - If a plan is referenced, examine that file (at the path given) to understand the
     step/checkpoint context.

2. **Analyze the Work**
   - Identify what was actually changed (files created, modified, deleted) from `files`.
   - Understand the purpose of the changes from each file's `diff`.
   - Connect changes to any plan elements if applicable.

3. **Compose the Commit Message**
   Format:
   ```
   <brief summary line, max 50 chars>

   - <what was done>
   - <key files changed>
   - <plan reference if applicable: "Completes [plan-name] phase X step Y">
   ```

   Rules:
   - First line: imperative mood, no period, under 50 characters
   - Bullets: terse, factual, no filler words
   - No buzzwords, no agile jargon, no "enhanced" or "improved" without specifics
   - Reference plan elements precisely when applicable
   - List only the most significant files if many changed
   - NEVER include Co-Authored-By lines or any AI/agent attribution

4. **Commit**
   - Commit in one command. `tug commit` stages by construction — it commits exactly the
     session's **non-ambiguous** changed files (`git add -- <files>` then
     `git commit -m … -- <files>`), so anything else in the working tree stays out:
     ```
     tug commit --message "<message>" --json
     ```
   - The message goes inline in `--message` (newlines are fine inside the quoted string).
   - **Narrowing or widening the file set:**
     - To include an `ambiguous` file whose diff clearly shows it as yours, or to commit an
       explicit subset (e.g. holding back a stray file), pass `--paths <p1> <p2> …`.
     - To include ambiguous files wholesale, add `--all`.
     - For the **"commit everything"** override, pass the full working-tree path set via
       `--paths <all changed files>`.
   - `tug commit --json` returns the structured receipt — `{ sha, branch, message,
     files:[{path,status,added,deleted}], aggregate, numstat }` — which the Session card's
     commit receipt renders directly. No separate `git show`/`--numstat` call is needed.
   - Do NOT use temp files, shell expansion (`$$`, `$(...)`), or heredocs — they trigger
     manual approval prompts.
   - Do NOT combine `cd` with the command. If you need to target a different directory, pass
     `--project <path>`.
   - Do not ask for confirmation — just commit.

5. **Report**
   - Show the short hash (`sha`) and commit message from the receipt so the user can see what
     was committed, and note any ambiguous files you held back or any inflight working-tree
     changes left uncommitted.

## Examples of Good Commit Messages

```
Add retry logic to API client

- Implement exponential backoff in src/api/client.rs
- Add RetryConfig struct with max_attempts, base_delay
- Completes api-hardening phase 2 step 3
```

```
Fix null pointer in user lookup

- Guard against missing user record in auth.py
- Add test for empty database case
```

## Examples of Bad Commit Messages (Never Do This)

- "Updated files" (meaningless)
- "Improvements and enhancements" (vague)
- "WIP" (not a commit message)
- "Fixed stuff" (uninformative)
- "As per the strategic initiative to leverage synergies..." (corporate fluff)
- "… to improve accessibility" (tacking on inferred takes about why a change was made)
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" (mentioning AI or agents)

## If Uncertain

- If `tug context` reports no changed files (and no override), report this and do nothing
- If changes seem unrelated to any plan, write message without plan reference
- If you cannot determine what the changes accomplish, describe them literally from the diff
- Do not stage files that look like secrets, credentials, or unrelated temporary files
