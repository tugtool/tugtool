## What this is

`plan-devise` turns an idea into a concrete, implementable **plan** — a plan document **written by you, the main conversation, directly**. No agent swarm, no clarifier/author/critic/conformance/overviewer hand-offs. You investigate the codebase, ask the few questions that genuinely change the design, write the plan, and validate it. The result is a plan document — written to a path **you specify** — that `/tugplug:dash-implement` can carry to a build.

(The skill is named `plan-devise`, not `plan`, to avoid colliding with Claude Code's built-in. The document it produces is a standard tugplan in the devise-skeleton format, so `/tugplug:dash-implement` consumes it unchanged.)

**You are the author.** Do not spawn sub-agents (`Task`). Do the research and the writing in-thread.

**The plan must stand alone.** Assume the session that implements the plan is **not** this one — a fresh session with none of your investigation context, file reads, or conversation history. Everything the implementer needs must be *in the document*: the file paths and symbol names you found, the behaviors and conventions you discovered, the reasoning behind each decision. Never write a plan that only works because the author is about to implement it.

## Input

`/tugplug:plan-devise <idea> [→ <output-path>]` — a free-text description of what to build, and **where to write the plan**.

## Where the plan goes (no assumed directory)

A plan is just a markdown file at an **explicit path**. There is **no default directory** — never assume `roadmap/`, `.tugtool/`, or any other home. If the invocation doesn't name an output path, **ask the user for it** (one question) before writing; propose a filename (from the slug) but let them supply the location. Write the plan exactly there and report the path you wrote. Whether and where it's committed to git is the user's call.

## The flow

### 1. Understand

Read the relevant code before designing. Use Glob/Grep/Read to map the territory: the components, the data flow, the existing conventions, the laws that apply (tuglaws for tugdeck work). Pull external references with WebFetch/WebSearch only when the idea needs them. The plan must be grounded in how the code actually works, not how you imagine it works.

### 2. Clarify (only what matters)

Ask clarifying questions **only when the answer changes the design** and you can't resolve it from the code or a sensible default. Use `AskUserQuestion` (≤4 options each). Don't interrogate — a couple of sharp questions beat a checklist. If the idea is already specific, skip straight to writing.

The boundary on what is worth asking is in the doctrine's [never-ask list](../../../tuglaws/dash-work-doctrine.md#what-never-gets-asked): design questions, never process ones, and nothing with a conventional default.

### 3. Write against the skeleton

Author the plan at the output path you were given (or asked for) following the **devise skeleton**, [`tuglaws/devise-skeleton.md`](../../../tuglaws/devise-skeleton.md) — this is the mandatory format. Conform to it exactly:

- The skeleton's section order: Purpose, Plan Metadata, Phase Overview (Context / Strategy / Success Criteria / Scope / Non-goals / Dependencies / Constraints / Assumptions), then Open Questions, Risks, Design Decisions, optional Deep Dives / Specification / Rollout / Symbol Inventory, Test Plan Concepts, **Execution Steps** (with a **Step Status Ledger**), Deliverables.
- Explicit `{#anchor}` headings; kebab-case; no phase numbers in anchors.
- Stable labels: plan-local Design Decisions `[P01]` (use `P`, **never** `D` — `[D##]` is reserved for the global `tuglaws/design-decisions.md`, which a plan may cite by reference), Open Questions `[Q01]`, Specs `S01`, Tables `T01`, Lists `L01`, Risks `R01`, Milestones `M01` — always two digits, never reused.
- **Execution Steps** each carry a `**Commit:**` message, `**References:**` (cite decisions/specs/anchors — never line numbers), `**Depends on:**` where applicable (anchor refs like `#step-1`), Tasks, Tests, and a falsifiable Checkpoint. This is the part `/tugplug:dash-implement` walks. Seed the **Step Status Ledger** with every step marked `pending`.
- For tugdeck/tugways work, fill the **State Zone Mapping** table — map each new piece of state to its tuglaws zone before writing steps.
- Resolve open questions where you can (spike them in-thread — read the code, check a fixture). **Ask the rest before you declare the plan ready** — a design question you cannot settle is an `AskUserQuestion` with the candidate answers as its options, raised while the user is still here, and the answer lands in the plan as a decided item. Only a question the user *declines to settle* stays `[Q##]`, with its rationale and its plan to resolve. That is what makes the notation mean something: **a `[Q##]` in a finished plan was asked and deferred, never never-asked.**

Prefer a tight, real plan over an exhaustive one. Every step should be executable with a clear commit boundary and a falsifiable checkpoint.

**Write for a cold reader.** Transcribe your investigation into the plan rather than alluding to it: name the exact files, functions, types, and messages a step touches; state the current behavior a change replaces; record non-obvious findings (gotchas, ordering constraints, existing conventions) in Deep Dives or the step itself. If a step's Tasks would make an implementer go re-derive something you already learned this session, the plan is incomplete — put the finding in the document.

### 4. Self-check

Run the checker over what you wrote:

```bash
tugutil plan lint <plan-path>
```

It answers the mechanical half — required sections, unique anchors, `[P##]` vs `[D##]`, per-step field presence, `**Depends on:**` resolution and direction, ledger integrity, banned test shapes. Fix every diagnostic it names, warnings included, and re-run until it is clean. Exit 0 is the bar before you hand off.

Then run the **cold-reader test**: could a fresh session, given only this document and the repository, implement every step without asking you anything? Hunt for references that lean on session context — "as discovered above", "the function we looked at", steps that name a change but not its location — and replace each with the concrete paths, symbols, and findings.

### 5. Ask for the review

The plan is not ready when you finish writing it; it is ready when it has been reviewed. Ask for that review from **inside this turn**, before you end it:

```bash
tugutil plan review-request --plan <absolute-plan-path>
```

This tells the running Tug instance that the plan is written. The card runs `/tugplug:plan-review <path>` as its next turn, on the review model, visibly — it borrows that model for the turn and gives it back afterward.

The signal goes through the server rather than through what the user typed, because only you know you finished. Fire it with an **absolute** path: the card does not share your cwd.

If the verb fails — no reachable Tug instance — do not declare the plan ready. Say the review could not be requested, and print the command for the user to run by hand, on its own line and inside backticks:

`` `/tugplug:plan-review roadmap/my-plan.md` ``

### 6. Hand off

Tell the user the plan is written, name the exact path, and say the review turn is coming next and on which model. Do not tell them to implement yet — the review may still change the plan.

The command after the review lands is `` `/tugplug:dash-implement <plan-path>` ``, and `plan-review` prints it. Write any command you do print on its own line **inside backticks**, command and path together in one span, with the real path substituted in — the Session card only turns a command line into a clickable chip when it arrives as its own inline code span; written as bare prose it is dead text.

Don't start reviewing or implementing from the devise skill — authoring, reviewing, and implementing are separate turns (as is committing the plan to git, which the user owns).

## Guardrails

- **No sub-agents.** Research and write in-thread.
- **Explicit path, no assumed directory.** The plan goes exactly where the user says. Never hardcode or default to `roadmap/`, `.tugtool/`, or any other location — ask if the path wasn't given.
- **Conform to the skeleton.** `tuglaws/devise-skeleton.md` is the format contract, upheld by authorship and review.
- **Ground the plan in the real code.** Read before you design.
- **Standalone always.** The plan must be implementable from any session with zero conversation context — bake every investigation finding into the document.
- **Don't over-ask.** Clarify only design-changing unknowns.
- **Lint before handing off.** `tugutil plan lint` exit 0 is the bar.
- **Ask for the review from inside your own turn**, with an absolute path, and never declare the plan ready when that request fails.
- **Don't auto-implement.** `plan-devise` produces the document; the review turn improves it; `dash-implement` runs it.
- **Don't auto-enter Plan mode** (`EnterPlanMode`) — just write the plan document.
