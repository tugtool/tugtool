# Claude Code Guidelines for Tugtool

## Project Overview

Tugtool is a developer tool suite. Its centerpiece is the **Session card** — a graphical surface where shell commands and AI interactions coexist in one UI, replacing the terminal. The suite includes tugcast (WebSocket multiplexer), tugcode (Claude Code bridge), tug (the unified developer CLI — changes & commits, dashes, host plumbing), tugdeck (browser frontend), tugplug (agentless skills), and Tug.app (macOS host).

## Git Policy

**ONLY THE USER CAN COMMIT TO GIT.** Do not run `git commit`, `git push`, or any git commands that modify the repository history unless explicitly instructed by the user. You may run read-only git commands like `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, etc.

**Exceptions:**
- Autonomous implementation: when the user explicitly authorizes autonomous sub-step execution (e.g., "go on your own"), commit after each sub-step using the `/tugplug:draft` skill's message style. Report each commit hash and message.
- The `implement` and `dash` skills commit on their **dash worktree** (never on `main`) via `tugutil dash commit`, as part of running a recipe / dash. `main` is only updated by the user's landing gestures.

The `/tugplug:draft` skill **never commits** — it authors the session's landing draft via `tugutil draft set`. Landing is the user's act: `/commit` (main lane) and `/join <name>` (dash lane) in the Session card are the landing gestures.

## Repository Structure

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `tugrust/` | Rust crates (tugcast, tug, tugexec, tugbank, tugcore, the `*-core` libraries — tugutil-core/tugdash-core/tugchanges-core — and supporting libraries) |
| `tugproto/` | Shared protocol / message types (TypeScript) |
| `tugcode/` | Claude Code bridge (stream-json IPC); bun-compiled binary |
| `tugdeck/` | Web frontend (the Session card lives here) |
| `tugapp/` | Swift macOS app (Tug.app host) |
| `tugplug/` | Claude Code plugin (agentless skills: devise/implement/dash/vet/audit/draft) |
| `tuglaws/` | Architecture laws + design decisions — the curated durable doc surface |
| `roadmap/` | Implementation plans (recipes) |
| `tests/` | App-test harness that drives the real Tug.app |

## Build Policy

**WARNINGS ARE ERRORS.** The Rust workspace enforces `-D warnings` via `tugrust/.cargo/config.toml`.

- `cargo build` will fail if there are any warnings
- `cargo nextest run` will fail if tests have any warnings
- Fix warnings immediately; do not leave them for later

## Testing

Run Rust tests with:
```bash
cd tugrust && cargo nextest run
```

### App-tests: run a selection, never a sweep

Every app-test launches its own `Tug.app` subprocess and the whole invocation is serialized behind a machine-wide gate, so running the corpus is expensive. **Selective runs are the default.**

```bash
just app-test-changed        # the everyday command — derived from your working diff
just app-test-select         # print that selection without running it
```

Selection is derived, not guessed: every `*.test.ts` declares the source it exercises with `@covers` lines in its header docblock, and `app-test-changed` resolves the changed files through those declarations. Any new test **must** carry `@covers` — `just app-test-covers-check` fails on a missing declaration or a path that no longer resolves.

Do **not** run `just app-test-all` on your own initiative. Run the full corpus only when:

- the user explicitly asks for it, or
- you changed the harness (`tests/app-test/_harness/`) or the app shell (`tugapp/Sources/`, `tugdeck/src/main.tsx`) — these sit underneath every test, so no `@covers` line can scope them and `app-test-changed` prints a **SWEEP ADVISED** advisory.

Bare `just app-test` (no arguments) is a curated **core tier** of ~20 tests — one per load-bearing surface — for a fast read on whether the app fundamentally works. It is deliberately not everything. `just app-test <files…>` runs exactly what you name.

The doctrine is in [tuglaws/app-test-harness.md](tuglaws/app-test-harness.md#selection-is-derived-not-remembered); the how-to is in [tests/app-test/README.md](tests/app-test/README.md#choosing-what-to-run).

## Tugdeck — Theme Token Files

Theme tokens live in `tugdeck/styles/themes/*.css` — `brio`/`nocturne`/`bravura` (dark) and `harmony`/`aria`/`vivace` (light). These are hand-authored CSS files — there is no generation script. Edit them directly when adding or tuning tokens. Each theme is one tint hue over a shared tone skeleton; see `tuglaws/theme-engine.md` for the authoring doctrine. Validate contrast with `bun run audit:theme-contrast` (no theme may exceed the `brio` accessibility budget). Register new themes in `SHIPPED_THEME_NAMES` (`tugdeck/src/action-dispatch.ts`).

## AskUserQuestion — shape and affordances

`AskUserQuestion`'s shape is fixed **upstream by Claude Code's own schema**, not by Tug: **1–4 questions per call, 2–4 options per question** (a hard minimum of 2 and maximum of 4 options). A call outside those bounds fails with an `InputValidationError` inside Claude Code *before* the request is ever forwarded to the Session card — so this is not a constraint Tug can relax by editing anything here.

When generating an `AskUserQuestion` call:
- Give each question **2–4 options**.
- If you have more candidate choices, split them across multiple questions (up to 4 questions per call) — the per-question cap is real, the per-call question count gives you room.

Two rows the terminal renders below the options — **`Type something`** (a free-text answer) and **`Chat about this`** (dismiss the questions and reply in prose) — are harness *affordances*, not options, and don't count against the 2–4 cap. On the answer side they come back as the free-text answer value and the optional top-level `response` field respectively. The Session card's `QuestionDialog` is where Tug renders these (see `chrome/session-question-dialog.tsx`).

Tug-side handling: the `QuestionDialog` renders **any** number of options with no cap of its own — the 2–4 limit lives only in Claude Code upstream. If a call somehow exceeds 4 (e.g. a drifted or hand-crafted payload), `AskUserQuestionToolBlock` detects the `InputValidationError` and mounts a salvage path so the user can still answer. Overflow is therefore graceful, but generate within 2–4 so the round-trip isn't wasted.

## Tugdeck — Tuglaws

Before implementing any tugways/tugdeck code, verify against the [Tuglaws](tuglaws/tuglaws.md) and [Design Decisions](tuglaws/design-decisions.md). Critical laws:

1. **One `root.render()`, at mount, ever.** [L01]
2. **External state enters React through `useSyncExternalStore` only.** [L02]
3. **Use `useLayoutEffect` for registrations that events depend on.** [L03]
4. **Appearance changes go through CSS and DOM, never React state.** [L06]
