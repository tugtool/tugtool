## Text Editing Base — CodeMirror 6 Spike {#text-editing-base}

**Purpose:** Replace the contenteditable substrate that backs `tug-prompt-input` with a CodeMirror 6 (CM6)-backed primitive named `tug-edit`, validate it via a focused spike, and ship a Component Gallery TextEdit card that exercises every feature `tug-prompt-input` exposes today. This phase lands the new substrate as an *additive* component sitting alongside the existing one — migration of `tug-prompt-input` / `tug-prompt-entry` / `tide-card` is a separate plan that follows the spike's go/no-go decision.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

`tug-prompt-input` is the editable substrate that powers `tug-prompt-entry`, the gallery prompt cards, and the live tide-card. It is built on a `contenteditable` div mediated by a 2,200-line `TugTextEngine` that papers over WebKit's quirks: atoms are rendered as `<img>` elements with SVG data URIs (so WebKit treats them as atomic replaced elements), the U+FFFC Object Replacement Character marks atom positions in the text stream, all mutations route through `execCommand` for native undo, and selection state is mirrored in [L23]'s active/inactive paint channels.

The implementation works. It also costs us: WebKit's `contenteditable` has a long tail of unfixed bugs (composition selection during IME on iOS 16.4+, focus surrender failures, dynamic-change accessibility regressions), and we are spending engineering effort polishing a substrate whose behavior we cannot influence. Every previous editor that started with raw `contenteditable` (Slack, Notion, Linear, Quip) has eventually moved to a framework that *abstracts* it. We are doing the same investigation, deliberately, before spending more time on a path with diminishing returns.

The investigation that preceded this plan ([Deep Dive — substrate evaluation](#substrate-evaluation)) compared four options — keep polishing `contenteditable`; adopt Monaco; adopt CodeMirror 6; build our own with Rust + WASM. The outcome is a decision to spike CM6 ([D01](#d01-spike-cm6)). The CM6 vs Lexical comparison is included in the deep dive because Lexical was the strongest non-CM alternative and the asymmetry argument (Lexical scales further into rich documents; CM6 scales further into code-shaped editing) shaped the decision.

The user's stated direction is *better than Claude Code TUI editing*, not *Notion competitor*. CM6's "Markdown source with live decorations" pattern (Obsidian Live Preview, `codemirror-rich-markdoc`) covers the realistic ceiling — bold/italic/headings/lists/code fences/blockquotes — with the underlying document remaining a flat character stream that the atom model fits perfectly. Tables, embeds with nested editable content, and Notion-style block rearrangement are explicitly accepted as out-of-scope ([D02](#d02-markdown-ceiling)).

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **Spike, don't migrate.** Land a new `tug-edit` component additively. `tug-prompt-input` keeps shipping unchanged. After the spike's exit criteria are met, a *separate* plan migrates the existing surfaces to consume `tug-edit`.
- **Risk-first ordering.** The two known soft spots — IME composition with atomic widgets adjacent, and the [L23] active/inactive selection-paint integration — get their own steps early, so a substrate-level "no" surfaces before we have invested in polish.
- **Atoms before everything else.** The atom model is what makes this substrate viable for prompts. Step 3 wires `EditorView.atomicRanges` + `Decoration.replace` and validates the cursor/selection/clipboard story before any other feature work piles on top.
- **Reuse the existing interfaces.** `TugTextInputDelegate`, `AtomSegment`, `CompletionProvider`, `HistoryProvider`, `DropHandler`, the right-click classifier, and the [L23] capture/restore protocol are substrate-agnostic and survive the swap. The CM6 backing is implementation, not contract.
- **Gallery card is the test surface.** A new TextEdit gallery card exercises every prop and every feature. The same card is what we demo to confirm exit criteria, and what reviewers walk through when judging substrate fit.
- **Build stays green at every commit.** `bun run check`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, and the workspace `cargo nextest run` pass on every step. `-D warnings` enforced.
- **Tuglaws apply at every step.** The new substrate is a tugways component and obeys [tuglaws.md](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md) without exception. [Table T02](#t02-tuglaws-applied) is the authoritative cross-walk: it names every law engaged by the spike, the compliance approach, and the step where each check lands. Every execution step's `**References:**` line cites the laws that step engages; Step 12 walks the full set.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

**Substrate viability:**

- [ ] Atoms render as inline replaced elements that the cursor skips over as a single character. Backspace deletes the whole atom; arrow keys step over it; selection extends by atom-as-unit. (verification: gallery card manual + automated test against CM6 `state.selection` after directional motion across an atom)
- [ ] Cut, copy, and paste round-trip atoms in plain text via U+FFFC + sidecar serialization, identical to current behavior. Paste from external clipboard preserves text and inserts no atoms. (verification: gallery card manual)
- [ ] CJK input method composition works with at least Japanese kana and Chinese pinyin, both adjacent to and across an atom. No selection collapse or glyph corruption during compose. (verification: manual scenarios documented in [Step 6](#step-6))
- [ ] [L23] active/inactive paint channels work: cmd-tab away from a tide-card hosting a `tug-edit` round-trips selection + scrollTop on return; cold-mount restore lands selection on the active card and inactive paint via `selectionGuard.cardRanges` on every other card. (verification: manual scenarios + existing pane-state preservation tests adapted)

**Feature parity with `tug-prompt-input`:**

- [ ] Every prop in [Table T01: tug-prompt-input feature surface](#t01-feature-surface) has an equivalent on `tug-edit` with documented equivalent or better behavior.
- [ ] Route prefixes (`>`, `$`, `:`) detected at position 0 fire `onRouteChange` and convert to a leading route atom, identical to `tug-prompt-input`. (verification: gallery card manual + test)
- [ ] Completion popup (`@` files, `/` slash commands) renders, filters, selects, and inserts atoms — using the existing `CompletionProvider` interface and the existing menu UI. (verification: gallery card with mock providers)
- [ ] History navigation (Cmd+Up / Cmd+Down) with `HistoryProvider` preserves draft on first back-step and restores it on forward-past-last. (verification: gallery card manual + test)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop from Finder onto the editor produces file atoms inserted at the drop point. (verification: manual)

**Theming:**

- [ ] All visible chrome (caret, selection, content fg, content bg, focus indication) reads from the tug 7-element token system via CSS variables. Theme switch (brio ↔ harmony) updates the live editor without remount. (verification: gallery card manual + token audit)
- [ ] Atoms re-render on theme change via the existing atom regeneration path. (verification: gallery card manual)

**Build and quality:**

- [ ] `bun run check`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint` exit zero. Rust `cargo nextest run` exits zero. Warnings still errors.
- [ ] CM6 dependency adds ≤ 150 KB gzip to the tugdeck production bundle (target). Actual delta documented in [Step 12](#step-12).
- [ ] Component-authoring-guide checklist passes for `tug-edit` and `gallery-text-edit`.

**Gallery surface:**

- [ ] A `TextEdit` card exists in the Component Gallery, registered alongside the existing `PromptInput` and `PromptEntry` cards. It exercises every prop and feature listed under [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface).

**Decision deliverable:**

- [ ] [Step 13](#step-13) records a written go/no-go on adopting CM6 as the substrate for `tug-prompt-input` and downstream surfaces. If go, a follow-on plan `tugplan-text-editing-migration.md` is scaffolded.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. New `tug-edit.tsx` + `tug-edit.css` substrate component, CM6-backed.
2. New `gallery-text-edit.tsx` Component Gallery card.
3. CM6 atom rendering via `Decoration.replace` + `EditorView.atomicRanges`, reusing `tug-atom-img.ts` for visual rendering.
4. CM6 theme extension wired to the tug 7-element token system; live theme switching.
5. CM6 keymap covering Return / Shift-Return / numpad Enter / Cmd+Enter / Cmd+A / Cmd+Up / Cmd+Down / standard editing motions.
6. Completion popup wired via existing `CompletionProvider` interface and existing menu UI.
7. History provider integration via existing `HistoryProvider` interface.
8. Drop handler integration via existing `DropHandler` interface.
9. [L23] active/inactive paint integration via `selectionGuard` + CSS Custom Highlight.
10. Right-click classifier and selection adapter ported to CM6 geometry.
11. IME validation gate covering at least one CJK input method.
12. Decision step recording substrate go/no-go.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Migrating `tug-prompt-input`, `tug-prompt-entry`, the live tide-card, or any other consumer to use `tug-edit`. (Follow-on plan.)
- Removing the existing `tug-prompt-input` / `TugTextEngine` code. The existing component continues to ship while the spike runs.
- Markdown rendering / live-preview decorations. (Follow-on plan; see [Roadmap / Follow-ons](#roadmap).)
- Tables, callouts, embeds with nested editable regions, Notion-style block rearrange. Excluded by [D02](#d02-markdown-ceiling).
- Multiple cursors, regex find-and-replace, vim/emacs keybindings, or any code-IDE feature beyond what `tug-prompt-input` exposes today.
- Collaborative editing / CRDTs / Yjs.
- Replacing the existing atom rendering technique (SVG-data-URI `<img>` via `tug-atom-img.ts`).

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- CM6 packages installable via bun (`@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`, `@codemirror/commands`, plus targeted extensions). No yarn / npm / pnpm — bun only ([feedback memory](../../../.claude/projects/-Users-kocienda-Mounts-u-src-tugtool/memory/feedback_use_bun.md)).
- Existing `tug-atom-img.ts` SVG rendering pipeline. No changes required for the spike.
- Existing `selectionGuard` and the `inactive-selection` CSS Custom Highlight ([L10], [L23]).
- Existing `useCardStatePreservation`, `TugPaneChrome` state preservation protocol ([L23]).
- Existing tug 7-element token CSS files (`brio.css`, `harmony.css`).
- Existing Component Gallery registration mechanism (`gallery-registrations.tsx`).

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- HMR is always running ([feedback memory](../../../.claude/projects/-Users-kocienda-Mounts-u-src-tugtool/memory/feedback_hmr.md)) — no manual builds for tugdeck during the spike.
- Tests must hit the real engine ([feedback memory](../../../.claude/projects/-Users-kocienda-Mounts-u-src-tugtool/memory/feedback_test_reality.md)) — no mock-store call-count tests.
- happy-dom may not be used for focus / selection / event-ordering tests across React renders ([feedback memory](../../../.claude/projects/-Users-kocienda-Mounts-u-src-tugtool/memory/feedback_no_happy_dom_tests.md)). The integration surface is verified manually + via `just app-test` where applicable.
- `-D warnings` on Rust, `tsc --noEmit` clean on TypeScript, `audit:tokens lint` clean on CSS.
- No direct DOM writes that bypass [L22] without a documented reason. CM6 owns its DOM tree; we observe it via its API.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- CM6's `EditorView.atomicRanges` faithfully implements "skip range as one cursor unit" for cursor motion, selection extension, and `deleteCharBackward` / `deleteCharForward`. Validated in [Step 3](#step-3).
- CM6's IME story with adjacent atomic widgets is workable, possibly with caveats. Validated in [Step 6](#step-6); a hard fail there is a substrate-level no.
- React StrictMode double-mount can be reconciled with CM6 lifecycle by storing the `EditorView` on a stable ref and disposing it on cleanup. Standard pattern in `@uiw/react-codemirror` and similar wrappers.
- The existing `TugTextInputDelegate` shape can drive a CM6 backend without contract changes. If a method requires a substrate-shape change (e.g., character-position semantics that differ from CM6's offset model), the change is documented and applied symmetrically to the existing engine after the spike.

### Reference and Anchor Conventions (MANDATORY) {#reference-conventions}

This plan uses explicit `{#anchor}` tags on every cited heading and the `[ID] Label` convention for design decisions, open questions, risks, specs, and tables. All execution-step `**References:**` lines cite by anchor and ID; no line numbers.

---

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] CM6 atomic-range fidelity vs current atom UX (DECIDED) {#q01-atomic-fidelity}

**Question:** Does `EditorView.atomicRanges` + `Decoration.replace` produce cursor / selection / delete behavior across atoms that matches what users have today with the SVG-`<img>` replaced element approach?

**Why it matters:** The atom is the load-bearing concept of the prompt input. Any divergence — e.g., shift-arrow stepping into the middle of a multi-atom run, or backspace deleting one character of a label rather than the whole atom — breaks the existing UX contract.

**Plan to resolve:** Prototype in [Step 3](#step-3). The success criterion is concretely enumerated in [List L01](#l01-atom-motion-cases).

**Resolution:** DECIDED — `EditorView.atomicRanges` lifted from the `atomDecorationField`'s `Decoration.replace` ranges produces correct one-step motion (`view.moveByChar` advances or retreats one document offset across each U+FFFC), one-step deletion (`deleteCharBackward` / `deleteCharForward` remove the whole atom and clear the decoration), and one-step selection extension. Tests in `tug-edit.test.tsx` cover motion, extension, and both delete directions. Cases 1–7 in [List L01](#l01-atom-motion-cases) are covered by the integration tests; cases 8–10 (clipboard) are covered by the pure serialization round-trip tests in `tug-edit-clipboard.test.ts` and exercised end-to-end via the gallery card.

---

#### [Q02] Atom clipboard serialization (DECIDED) {#q02-atom-clipboard}

**Question:** When an atom is copied or cut, what does the clipboard contain? Plain text with U+FFFC at the atom position? A sidecar JSON mime type for round-trip within tugdeck? Plain text with the atom's label?

**Why it matters:** Today, `TugTextEngine` controls this directly. CM6 has `clipboardInputFilter` / `clipboardOutputFilter` facets that intercept on the boundary; the question is what we *want* the contract to be, not how to implement it.

**Plan to resolve:** Decided alongside [Step 3](#step-3) — the cut/copy/paste round-trip test enumerates the expected behavior and the implementation matches. Documented in [D05](#d05-atom-rendering).

**Resolution:** DECIDED — three-payload contract:
1. `text/plain` (external apps): atom labels in place of U+FFFC, so external pastes see "Please review main.ts" rather than tofu glyphs.
2. `application/x-tug-atoms` (tug-internal): JSON sidecar versioned at `1` carrying `{ position, segment }` entries with positions relative to the copied slice. On paste, this rewrites the matching label-substrings in the plain text back to U+FFFC characters and dispatches a single transaction that applies both the inserted text and the matching `addAtomsEffect`.
3. The `text/plain` representation that *would* go on the clipboard for tug-internal pastes carries U+FFFC directly — but in practice tug-internal pastes always read the sidecar first. The fallback string (label-substituted) is what other apps see. Implementation in `tug-edit/clipboard-filters.ts`; pure tests in `tug-edit-clipboard.test.ts` cover the round-trip and rejection of malformed sidecars.

---

#### [Q03] CM6 lifecycle vs React StrictMode (DECIDED) {#q03-strict-mode}

**Question:** How does the `EditorView` lifecycle survive StrictMode's double-mount in dev?

**Why it matters:** A naïve `useLayoutEffect` that constructs an `EditorView` and tears it down on cleanup will run twice in StrictMode and may leak a mount or fail to dispose listeners. We have hit similar issues in the existing engine.

**Plan to resolve:** Adopt the standard pattern used by `@uiw/react-codemirror`: store the view on a ref, construct in `useLayoutEffect`, dispose in cleanup, branch on existence. Validated by mounting / unmounting `gallery-text-edit` repeatedly with no console warnings and no DOM leftovers. Documented in [Step 1](#step-1).

**Resolution:** DECIDED — `useLayoutEffect` with empty deps constructs the view, the cleanup destroys it and clears `viewRef.current` to `null`. StrictMode's mount/unmount/mount cycle creates a fresh view each pass and disposes the previous one cleanly. The `view()` delegate method reads `viewRef.current` at call time so consumers see the live view across the cycle. Recorded inline in `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-edit.tsx`. Test coverage in `tug-edit.test.tsx` exercises the unmount → re-mount round-trip and asserts a fresh `EditorView` instance is constructed.

---

#### [Q04] Where does the route atom live in the document? (OPEN) {#q04-route-atom-position}

**Question:** Is the leading route atom (the `>`, `$`, or `:` glyph) inside the editor document at offset 0, or rendered as sibling DOM that the editor doesn't know about?

**Why it matters:** Today the route atom is in the doc. CM6 supports both: it can live in the doc as a `Decoration.replace` over offset 0, *or* it can be a sibling DOM element and the editor doc starts post-route. The first preserves the current model; the second simplifies cursor-at-start handling.

**Plan to resolve:** Decided in [Step 10](#step-10) when the route-prefix feature lands. Default is "in the doc at offset 0" to match existing semantics, switched if a concrete blocker appears.

**Resolution:** OPEN. Resolved in Step 10.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| IME × atomic widget unreliability | high | medium | Step 6 is a dedicated gate; failure halts the spike. | CJK compose drops characters, collapses selection, or corrupts glyph next to an atom. |
| [L23] paint channels don't fit CM6's lifecycle | high | low | Step 7 is a dedicated step; the engine-level `paintMirrorAsActive` / `paintMirrorAsInactive` shape is preserved at the API boundary. | Pane-state preservation tests fail or selection is lost on cmd-tab. |
| Bundle size delta exceeds ~150 KB gzip target | medium | medium | Step 12 records actual delta; if over, document tree-shaking opportunities and accept or revisit. | Bundle delta > 200 KB gzip. |
| Atom clipboard round-trip diverges from current behavior | medium | medium | Step 3 enumerates the expected behavior up front. | Paste of a copied prompt loses an atom. |
| CM6 forces an API change to `TugTextInputDelegate` | medium | low | Apply the change symmetrically to both backends after the spike. | A delegate method maps poorly onto CM6's offset model. |

**Risk R01: IME composition with atomic widgets** {#r01-ime-atoms}

- **Risk:** CM6's documented IME interaction with `atomicRanges` has known rough edges in the upstream forum. Composition adjacent to an atomic widget can interrupt the selection.
- **Mitigation:** Step 6 is a dedicated validation gate with an explicit halt condition. Test with at least Japanese kana and Chinese pinyin; document any observed misbehavior; reproduce upstream and file if novel.
- **Residual risk:** A class of users (CJK input) may have a degraded experience even after mitigation. If so, the substrate decision tilts back toward Lexical or staying with `contenteditable`.

**Risk R02: [L23] mirror paint vs CM6 ownership** {#r02-l23-mirror}

- **Risk:** CM6 owns its DOM tree; the `cm-content` node identity may change on reconfigure. The existing `paintMirrorAsActive` / `paintMirrorAsInactive` writes selection through `window.getSelection()` and CSS Custom Highlights; the active-paint channel may collide with CM6's own focus / selection management.
- **Mitigation:** Step 7 routes active-paint through CM6's `EditorView.dispatch({ selection })` rather than direct `window.getSelection()` writes; inactive-paint continues to use `selectionGuard.cardRanges` against the live `cm-content` node read at fire time.
- **Residual risk:** If CM6 reconfigures the content node mid-flight (e.g., during theme switch), an inactive Range may dangle until the next paint pass.

**Risk R03: Bundle size** {#r03-bundle}

- **Risk:** Adding CM6 grows the tugdeck production bundle by 75–135 KB gzip per upstream estimates, more if extensions accrete.
- **Mitigation:** Use only the extensions we actually need; document the delta in Step 12; revisit if delta > 200 KB gzip.
- **Residual risk:** The cost is real and permanent; this is part of the tradeoff accepted in [D01](#d01-spike-cm6).

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [D01] Spike with CodeMirror 6 (DECIDED) {#d01-spike-cm6}

**Decision:** Adopt CodeMirror 6 as the substrate for the new `tug-edit` component. Reject continuing to polish raw `contenteditable`, reject Monaco (too heavy, atom model mismatch, theming friction), reject rolling our own in Rust + WASM (text layout / IME / accessibility cost is multi-engineer-year). Lexical was the strongest non-CM alternative; rejected for this spike because the user's stated direction (better Claude Code TUI editing, not Notion) keeps the ceiling within CM6's reach, and CM6's atomic-range model fits atoms more naturally than Lexical's `DecoratorNode` (which has a known selection-null limitation when selection lands over the decorator).

**Rationale:**
- CM6's `EditorView.atomicRanges` facet is purpose-built for the atom semantics we need.
- CM6 is designed for single-font code-shaped editing — our prompt-input use case is exactly that shape.
- CM6 is production-proven by Replit, Sourcegraph, JupyterLab, Obsidian, and Observable.
- Theming via CSS variables and `EditorView.theme()` maps cleanly onto the tug 7-element token system.
- Bundle cost (~75–135 KB gzip) is acceptable.
- Existing `TugTextInputDelegate` and adjacent interfaces are substrate-agnostic and survive the swap.

**Implications:**
- Markdown is the realistic feature ceiling ([D02](#d02-markdown-ceiling)).
- IME × atomic-widget interaction is a known soft spot and gets a dedicated validation step ([R01](#r01-ime-atoms), [Step 6](#step-6)).
- The spike is *additive* — `tug-prompt-input` keeps shipping until the migration plan lands.

#### [D02] Markdown ceiling accepted; rich documents out of scope (DECIDED) {#d02-markdown-ceiling}

**Decision:** The feature ceiling for `tug-edit` is "single-font editing with atoms, plus optionally Markdown source with live decorations" (the pattern Obsidian Live Preview and `codemirror-rich-markdoc` use). Tables, callouts with nested editable regions, Notion-style block rearrange, and non-Markdown structured-document features are explicitly out of scope. If the project's direction later requires those features, the substrate decision is reopened.

**Rationale:**
- The user has stated the goal is "better than Claude Code TUI editing", not a Notion competitor.
- CM6's flat-string data model cannot represent nested editable regions cleanly. Pretending otherwise wastes effort.
- The Markdown-source-with-live-decorations pattern is well-trodden, fits CM6's strengths, and covers bold/italic/headings/lists/code fences/blockquotes.

**Implications:**
- The follow-on Markdown plan ([Roadmap / Follow-ons](#roadmap)) targets *source with live decorations*, not WYSIWYG.
- Any future requirement for tables / nested blocks triggers a substrate re-evaluation rather than an attempt to bend CM6 into shapes it doesn't fit.

#### [D03] New component name is `tug-edit`, sibling to `tug-prompt-input` (DECIDED) {#d03-tug-edit-name}

**Decision:** The new substrate component is named `tug-edit` and lives at `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-edit.tsx`. It is a *substrate*, lower-level than `tug-prompt-input` — it does not own route prefixes, route atoms, or any prompt-domain semantics on its own. Those features sit on top of it as composable extensions or are surfaced via props that are off by default.

**Rationale:**
- Decouples the substrate from the prompt-domain composition.
- Clear naming for the eventual migration: `tug-prompt-input` becomes a wrapper around `tug-edit` with prompt-specific extensions enabled.
- Leaves room for non-prompt consumers (e.g., a future code-editing card, a notes card).

**Implications:**
- Route-prefix support is a `tug-edit` *option* (off by default), not a hard-coded behavior.
- The Component Gallery card is named `TextEdit` (not `Edit`, which is too generic) to mirror the component name.

#### [D04] Spike is additive; existing component keeps shipping (DECIDED) {#d04-additive}

**Decision:** This phase ships `tug-edit` and the `TextEdit` gallery card. It does *not* migrate `tug-prompt-input`, `tug-prompt-entry`, or `tide-card` to use the new substrate. The migration is a separate plan, gated on the spike's go/no-go ([Step 13](#step-13)).

**Rationale:**
- Smallest blast radius. The live tide-card keeps working through the spike.
- Decision can be reversed after the spike without unwinding migration work.
- Reviewers can compare the two side-by-side in the gallery.

**Implications:**
- Two prompt-shaped components live in the codebase during the spike phase. Documented as a known temporary state.
- The migration plan (`tugplan-text-editing-migration.md`) is scaffolded in Step 13 if the decision is "go".

#### [D05] Atoms remain SVG-`<img>` rendered, embedded as CM6 widgets (DECIDED) {#d05-atom-rendering}

**Decision:** The existing `tug-atom-img.ts` SVG-data-URI rendering pipeline is reused unchanged. The CM6 atom widget is a `WidgetType` whose `toDOM()` returns an `<img>` element produced by `createAtomImgElement`. The text representation of an atom in the CM6 document is U+FFFC, identical to the existing engine. Cut/copy/paste round-trip uses U+FFFC + sidecar serialization in a custom MIME type for in-tugdeck pastes; external clipboard contains plain-text fallback (label-of-atom).

**Rationale:**
- Preserves the visual + accessibility behavior already shipped.
- Keeps the atom regeneration-on-theme-change path intact.
- Aligns the CM6 document model (offsets over a flat string) with the existing engine's text model — `getText()` semantics stay identical.

**Implications:**
- The CM6 atom widget is small: it wraps `createAtomImgElement` and exposes the standard `WidgetType` lifecycle.
- `clipboardInputFilter` / `clipboardOutputFilter` facets handle the round-trip; the plain-text fallback for external paste is explicit.

#### [D06] Theme via `EditorView.theme()` reading CSS variables (DECIDED) {#d06-theming}

**Decision:** The CM6 theme extension uses `EditorView.theme()` and `EditorView.baseTheme()` with CSS that references the existing tug 7-element CSS variables directly (`var(--tug-text-fg-default)`, `var(--tug-bg-selection-active)`, etc.). The `EditorView` does not subscribe to `subscribeThemeChange` — token swaps via the existing CSS-variable mechanism reach the editor automatically. Atom regeneration on theme change continues to use `engine.regenerateAtoms()`-equivalent (a re-decoration pass triggered by `subscribeThemeChange`), since the SVGs are baked at atom-construction time.

**Rationale:**
- Smallest possible coupling between CM6 and the tug theme system.
- Theme switches stay live without remount.
- Mirrors the styling approach used elsewhere in tugdeck — CSS variables are the contract.

**Implications:**
- All editor chrome appearance is controlled through the existing token files (`brio.css`, `harmony.css`).
- Adding a token for an editor-specific concern (e.g., a CM6 gutter color) follows the standard 7-element pattern.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### Tuglaws compliance {#tuglaws-compliance}

This spike implements a new tugways component, so [tuglaws.md](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md) governs every step. This subsection enumerates the laws engaged by the spike, how `TugEdit` complies, and where each compliance check lands. Each execution step's `**References:**` line cites the laws that step engages; the table below is the authoritative cross-walk.

**Table T02: Tuglaws applied to `TugEdit`** {#t02-tuglaws-applied}

| Law | Engagement | Compliance approach | Where it lands |
|---|---|---|---|
| [L01] One `root.render()` at mount | Always | The React shell mounts once; CM6 manages its own DOM tree internally and is never re-rendered through React after construction. | Steps 1, 11 (gallery uses the registered card factory; no external `root.render`). |
| [L02] External state via `useSyncExternalStore` only | When CM6 state must drive React renders | When the React shell *renders* something derived from CM6 state (e.g., the typeahead popup's open/closed flag), it subscribes through `useSyncExternalStore` against a small subscribable adapter over `EditorView.updateListener`. CM6's internal state is never copied into `useState`. | Step 5 (typeahead state observer), Step 7 (state-preservation hook). |
| [L03] `useLayoutEffect` for registrations events depend on | Always | Mount, dispose, state-preservation registration, route-prefix listener, and typeahead extension registration all run in `useLayoutEffect` so the substrate is ready before any keyboard or pointer event can land. | Steps 1, 5, 7, 9, 10. |
| [L04] No measure-after-parent-setState on child DOM | Completion popup positioning | Popup position reads `EditorView.coordsAtPos` directly from the live view rather than via React-state-driven layout. | Step 5. |
| [L05] No `requestAnimationFrame` for React-commit-coupled work | Always | We never use rAF to bridge CM6 state into React commits. CM6 has its own scheduler; the React shell observes via `EditorView.updateListener`. | All steps (negative invariant). |
| [L06] Appearance via CSS and DOM, never React state | Theme, atom rendering, focus indication, disabled, placeholder, growDirection, maximized, focusStyle, borderless, drag-over | All editor visuals flow through CSS variables (theme), CM6 widget DOM (atoms), CSS class toggles on the host (focus / disabled), and DOM-side mutations (drop hover). No `useState` drives editor appearance. | Steps 2, 3, 8, 10. |
| [L07] Handlers access state through refs / stable singletons | Delegate methods, keymap handlers, completion select, drop handler, route-prefix listener | The `useImperativeHandle` delegate reads `viewRef.current` at call time; CM6 keymap handlers receive `view` as their argument; provider closures hold refs. | Steps 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10. |
| [L09] Cards never set their own position / size / z-order | Gallery card | `gallery-text-edit.tsx` sets only content layout; the hosting `TugPane` owns geometry. | Steps 1, 11. |
| [L10] One responsibility per layer | Always | `TugEdit` is the substrate (text editing); `gallery-text-edit` is composition (demo); the eventual `tug-prompt-input` wrapper layers prompt-domain semantics on top. The substrate exposes route-prefix support as an *option*, off by default. | Steps 1, 10, 13. |
| [L11] Controls emit; responders own state | Always — `TugEdit` is a responder | `TugEdit` owns the document, caret, and selection: it is the responder for `cut` / `copy` / `paste` / `selectAll` / `undo` / `redo` and the domain `submit` action. Step 4 wires the keymap; Step 5 wires completion-menu emitter→responder routing; Step 9 wires the right-click context menu. | Steps 1 (declared), 4, 5, 9. |
| [L12] Selection stays inside card boundaries | Selection paint, state preservation | The `cm-content` node is registered with `SelectionGuard` as the editor's selection boundary; inactive-selection paint goes through `selectionGuard.cardRanges` so selection cannot escape the card. | Steps 7, 9. |
| [L13] CSS for declarative motion; rAF only for gesture frame loops | Caret blink, focus transition, drag-over feedback | All editor motion is CSS-driven. No rAF. | Steps 2, 8. |
| [L15] Token-driven control states | Theme, focus, disabled | Editor states (rest, focus, disabled, readonly) use seven-slot tokens; color transitions provide all interaction feedback — no box-shadow, no translateY, no gradients. | Steps 2, 10. |
| [L16] Foreground-only rules declare `@tug-renders-on` | Theme CSS, gallery card CSS | Every CSS rule that sets `color`, `fill`, or `border-color` without `background-color` carries a `@tug-renders-on` annotation naming its surface. `audit-tokens lint` enforces this. The component's `@tug-pairings` block is added when the theme lands. | Steps 1 (gallery card), 2 (theme), 10 (state styles). |
| [L17] Component aliases resolve to `--tug7-*` in one hop | Theme | If `--tugx-edit-*` aliases are introduced, each resolves directly to a `--tug7-*` token — no alias-to-alias chains. The audit enforces this. | Step 2. |
| [L18] Element / surface vocabulary | Theme | Editor text uses `--tug7-element-*`; editor background uses `--tug7-surface-*`. Pairings are declared. | Step 2. |
| [L19] Component authoring guide | Always | File pair (`tug-edit.tsx` + `tug-edit.css`), module docstring with the standardized citation set, props interface, `data-slot="editor"`, CSS organization. The gallery card mirrors the convention. | All steps. |
| [L20] Each component owns scoped tokens; composed children keep theirs | When `TugEdit` composes other tug components | If later steps compose tug components inside the editor (e.g., context menu, completion menu), `TugEdit`'s CSS references only its own `--tug7-element-edit-*` / `--tug7-surface-edit-*` slot; composed children's tokens are not overridden. | Steps 5, 9. |
| [L21] Third-party code requires license compliance | CM6 substrate | CodeMirror 6 (MIT) is logged in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` (existing entry, expanded for the substrate adoption). Each consuming source file references the notice. | Step 1 (notices update + tug-edit.tsx citation), Steps 2–10 (extension modules cite the same entry). |
| [L22] Direct DOM updates via store observer, not React round-trip | Completion provider results, inactive-selection paint | When CM6's `updateListener` triggers a paint to `selectionGuard.cardRanges`, the observer writes directly to the DOM — no `useSyncExternalStore` round-trip. Completion provider observers are subscribed through their store's API, not through React state. | Steps 5, 7. |
| [L23] Internal operations must not lose user-visible state | State preservation | Selection, focus, scroll, content survive CM6 reconfigure, theme switch, cmd-tab cycle, tab deactivation, and cold-mount restore via the `useCardStatePreservation` protocol. The active/inactive paint distinction is the central mechanism. | Step 7. |
| [L24] State partitioned into appearance / local data / structure | Always | Appearance (caret, selection paint, focus ring) → CSS / DOM. Local data (`viewRef`, `hostRef`, internal flags) → `useRef`. Structure (subscriptions to providers, state-preservation registration) → `useSyncExternalStore` / `useLayoutEffect` / store observers. | All steps. |
| [L25] Deck → Pane → Card hierarchy | Gallery card | The TextEdit gallery card is content; the `TugPane` chrome owns its position, size, and z-order. | Steps 1, 11. |

**Laws not engaged by this spike:**

- [L08] Live preview in mutation transactions — the editor's edits are committed values per keystroke; no draft-vs-commit distinction.
- [L14] Radix Presence enter/exit boundary — the spike does not introduce Radix-managed enter/exit.

**Compliance verification per step:**

Each step's `**References:**` line cites the law IDs the step engages. Step 12 (Integration Checkpoint) explicitly walks the entire law set against the new code and records the result. The component-authoring-guide checklist covers the [L19] surface; `audit-tokens lint` covers [L16] / [L17] / [L18] / [L20]; the tests in Steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9 cover the runtime invariants ([L01], [L03], [L07], [L11], [L23]).

#### Substrate evaluation {#substrate-evaluation}

##### Option A — Keep polishing `contenteditable`

**Pros:** Existing investment of ~3,500 lines (`tug-prompt-input.tsx` 1,303 + `tug-prompt-entry.tsx` 1,135 + `tug-text-engine.ts` 2,245 + atoms/CSS) is preserved.

**Cons:** WebKit's `contenteditable` has a long tail of unfixed bugs — composition selection on iOS 16.4+ ([Apple developer forum thread 730031](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/730031)), focus surrender ([WebKit bug 112854](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=112854)), AX object updates after dynamic changes, unwanted `&nbsp;` insertion ([WebKit bug 38902](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=38902)). Every previous editor that started here moved away.

**Verdict:** Reject. The polish curve is asymptotic and the substrate is not under our control.

##### Option B — Monaco

**Pros:** Production-grade editor (powers VS Code).

**Cons:** Multi-megabyte bundle. No first-class atomic inline widget that participates in cursor motion. Theming system is its own world (Monarch tokens, theme JSON) and does not map cleanly onto CSS variables.

**Verdict:** Reject. Monaco is the right tool for IntelliSense over a TS program, not for a prompt composer with atoms.

##### Option C — CodeMirror 6 (chosen)

**Pros:**
- `EditorView.atomicRanges` is purpose-built for atom semantics.
- Designed for single-font code-shaped editing.
- Bundle ~75–135 KB gzip.
- Theming via `EditorView.theme()` + CSS variables is straightforward.
- Production-proven (Replit, Sourcegraph, JupyterLab, Obsidian, Observable).
- `clipboardInputFilter` / `clipboardOutputFilter` facets give clean clipboard control.
- Markdown source with live decorations (the realistic ceiling per [D02](#d02-markdown-ceiling)) is a well-trodden CM6 pattern.

**Cons:**
- IME × atomic widgets has rough edges in upstream forum reports ([R01](#r01-ime-atoms)).
- Setup is more code than people expect (state + view + extensions + keymap + theme).
- Architecture is principled but not React-shaped; the `@uiw/react-codemirror` wrapper papers over the lifecycle but you'll likely drop down to raw `EditorView` for our level of integration.
- Cannot scale into Notion-shape (tables, nested editable blocks). Accepted in [D02](#d02-markdown-ceiling).

**Verdict:** Adopt for spike ([D01](#d01-spike-cm6)).

##### Option C-alt — Lexical (rejected for this spike)

**Pros:** Tree-based document model with first-class `ParagraphNode` / `HeadingNode` / `QuoteNode` / `CodeNode` / `ListNode` / `TableNode`. `DecoratorNode` for embedding React components inline. Modular plugin model. `lexical-beautiful-mentions` is an off-the-shelf reference for the atom pattern. Markdown import/export via `@lexical/markdown`. Bundle 22 KB gzip core; 100–180 KB gzip with rich-text plugins.

**Cons (versus our brief):**
- `DecoratorNode` selection becomes `null` when selection lands over the decorator. This interacts directly with [L23] selection preservation.
- Code-editing ergonomics (multi-cursor, find/replace, large-text scrolling) are mediocre — Lexical's strengths point the other way.
- Lexical owns more of the React lifecycle than CM6 does. Our existing engine-as-stable-ref + direct-DOM + `useSyncExternalStore` pattern fits CM6 more naturally.
- `GridSelection` design is internally debated upstream ([Lexical issue #5276](https://github.com/facebook/lexical/issues/5276)).

**Asymmetry argument:** Lexical scales further into rich documents (tables, blocks, embeds) than CM6; CM6 scales further into code-shaped editing (multi-cursor, search/replace, large-document) than Lexical. The user's stated direction is the latter half of that asymmetry — better than Claude Code TUI editing, not Notion. CM6 fits.

**Revisit if:** the user's direction shifts toward tables, nested editable blocks, or Notion-style block rearrange. At that point this decision is reopened.

##### Option D — Roll our own (Rust + WASM)

**Pros:** Total control.

**Cons:** Text layout, IME, RTL/bidi, accessibility, font fallback, caret geometry on wrapped lines — these are years of engineering. Monaco's team paid that cost over many years. The tug-markdown-view comparison is misleading: Markdown rendering is pure output; an editor is bidirectional with the OS input stack.

**Verdict:** Reject for now. Revisit only if both CM6 and Lexical fail.

#### tug-prompt-input feature surface {#t01-feature-surface}

**Table T01: tug-prompt-input feature surface (mirror in `tug-edit`)** {#t01-feature-surface}

| Prop / behavior | Today | `tug-edit` mapping |
|---|---|---|
| `placeholder` | Empty-state hint | `@codemirror/view` placeholder extension |
| `maxRows` | Visible rows before scroll | CSS `max-height: calc(line-height * maxRows)` on `.cm-scroller` |
| `returnAction` (`"submit"` / `"newline"`) | Return-key behavior on main keyboard | High-priority CM6 keymap on `Enter` |
| `numpadEnterAction` (`"submit"` / `"newline"`) | Enter-key behavior on numpad | Distinct keymap entry; numpad Enter is `code: "NumpadEnter"` |
| `onSubmit` | Submit handler | Invoked by submit-action keymap |
| `onChange` | Content-change handler | CM6 `EditorView.updateListener` filtering on `update.docChanged` |
| `completionProviders` | `Record<trigger, CompletionProvider>` | CM6 extension watching trigger characters; existing menu UI rendered alongside the editor DOM |
| `historyProvider` | Cmd+Up / Cmd+Down navigation | Custom keymap dispatching transactions |
| `onTypeaheadChange` | External observer of typeahead | Same callback shape; fired from the completion extension |
| `dropHandler` | DragEvent → `AtomSegment[]` | `EditorView` `domEventHandlers` with `posAtCoords` for insertion offset |
| `disabled` | Read-only | `EditorState.readOnly` facet + CSS class |
| `completionDirection` (`"up"` / `"down"`) | Popup direction | Existing menu UI prop, unchanged |
| `growDirection` (`"up"` / `"down"`) | Editor grow direction | Wrapper flex direction; CM6 default for "down", flex-end alignment for "up" |
| `maximized` | Fill flex parent | CSS `flex: 1 1 auto` on outer; ignore `maxRows` |
| `focusStyle` (`"background"` / `"ring"`) | Focus indication | CSS class toggled via CM6 `EditorView.focusChangeEffect`-equivalent listener |
| `borderless` | Suppress border | CSS modifier |
| `routePrefixes` | First-char route-detect glyphs | CM6 transaction filter on offset 0; first-char insertion replaces with route atom |
| `onRouteChange` | Route change callback | Fired by the route-prefix transaction filter |

| Active / inactive paint ([L23]) | `paintMirrorAsActive` / `paintMirrorAsInactive` | Active: `EditorView.dispatch({ selection })` + focus. Inactive: `selectionGuard.cardRanges` Range against `cm-content` |
| Drag-and-drop file → atom | File drop produces atoms | `domEventHandlers.drop` with `posAtCoords` |
| Theme switch live update | CSS variables propagate; atoms regenerate | CSS variables propagate automatically; atom regeneration via `subscribeThemeChange` triggers a re-decoration transaction |
| Undo / redo | Native `execCommand` undo | `@codemirror/commands` history extension + Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z keymap |
| IME composition | `compositionstart` / `compositionend` lifecycle | CM6 native IME handling; verified in [Step 6](#step-6) |

#### Atom motion correctness cases {#l01-atom-motion-cases}

**List L01: Atom motion correctness cases (Step 3 acceptance)** {#l01-atom-motion-cases}

1. Right-arrow with caret immediately before an atom moves caret to immediately after the atom in one keystroke.
2. Left-arrow with caret immediately after an atom moves caret to immediately before in one keystroke.
3. Backspace with caret immediately after an atom deletes the entire atom.
4. Forward-delete with caret immediately before an atom deletes the entire atom.
5. Shift+right-arrow with caret immediately before an atom extends selection across the entire atom.
6. Double-click on an atom selects the atom as a whole (not a sub-range).
7. Cmd+A selects the whole document including all atoms.
8. Copy of a selection containing one or more atoms places U+FFFC + sidecar in clipboard.
9. Paste of that clipboard payload reconstructs the atoms.
10. Type-then-paste sequence preserves cursor placement after the pasted atoms.

### Specification {#specification}

#### Inputs and Outputs {#inputs-outputs}

`tug-edit` props mirror `tug-prompt-input`'s prop surface (per [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface)) with the following deltas:

- `routePrefixes` and `onRouteChange` are off by default. (`tug-edit` is the substrate; the prompt-domain wrappers turn them on.)
- A new `extensions` prop accepts an array of additional CM6 `Extension`s that the host can layer on top. Default: `[]`. This is the seam through which the future migration adds prompt-specific behavior without forking the substrate.

#### Public API Surface {#public-api}

The `EditorView` is the source of truth for document and selection. The React shell observes via `EditorView.updateListener` and surfaces typed callbacks (`onChange`, `onTypeaheadChange`, `onRouteChange`). The shell does *not* round-trip state through React state ([L02], [L22]).

### Documentation Plan {#documentation-plan}

- [ ] Component-authoring header docblock on `tug-edit.tsx` matching the existing pattern (laws, design decisions, expected use).
- [ ] README block in `tug-edit/` describing the extension layout for future maintainers.
- [ ] Update `component-library-roadmap.md` to add `tug-edit` and the `TextEdit` gallery card.
- [ ] Cross-reference `tuglaws.md` if any law gets a new clarification from the spike.

---

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Unit** | Pure functions in `tug-edit/*.ts` (clipboard filter, atom widget construction) | Step-local |
| **Integration (real engine)** | `tug-edit` mounted in a real React tree against the real CM6 view | Across steps; replaces happy-dom mocks for selection / focus / event-ordering |
| **Manual (gallery)** | Walk the `TextEdit` card through every prop / feature | Every step that ships a behavior; Step 11 walks the full surface |
| **`just app-test`** | End-to-end integration where the full app harness applies | Selection / focus integration that touches the responder chain |

Manual scenarios are documented in each step. The IME validation gate (Step 6) is exclusively manual and produces a written report.

### Execution Steps {#execution-steps}

#### Step 1: Bootstrap CM6 + empty `tug-edit` skeleton {#step-1}

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): bootstrap CM6 substrate with empty editor`

**References:** [D01](#d01-spike-cm6), [D03](#d03-tug-edit-name), [Q03](#q03-strict-mode), [L01], [L03], [L06], [L07], [L11], [L19], [L21], [L24], Table T02, (#strategy, #internal-architecture, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `package.json`: add `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`, `@codemirror/commands` via `bun add`.
- `tug-edit.tsx` shell that constructs an `EditorView` in a `useLayoutEffect`, stores it on a ref, disposes on cleanup.
- `tug-edit.css` empty.
- `gallery-text-edit.tsx` stub registering a `TextEdit` card with an empty `<TugEdit>` inside.
- Registration in `gallery-registrations.tsx`.

**Tasks:**
- [x] `bun add @codemirror/state @codemirror/view @codemirror/commands` (in `tugdeck/`). Installed `@codemirror/state@6.6.0`, `@codemirror/view@6.41.1`, `@codemirror/commands@6.10.3`.
- [x] Implement `tug-edit.tsx` with the StrictMode-safe lifecycle pattern from [Q03](#q03-strict-mode).
- [x] Implement `gallery-text-edit.tsx` and register it.
- [x] Verify the gallery card mounts with a working empty editor: type, arrow keys, undo all functional. *(Manually verified by user.)*

**Tests:**
- [x] Unit: `tug-edit.test.tsx` mounts `<TugEdit />`, asserts the `EditorView` is created and `delegate.view()` returns it; unmounts and re-mounts verifying no leaks. *(3 tests pass, 12 expect calls.)*

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `bun run check` exits 0. *(Two pre-existing errors in `card-host.tsx` and `tug-pane.tsx` are present on main and unrelated to this step; no new errors introduced by Step 1.)*
- [x] `bun test` exits 0. *(2417 tests pass; full suite green.)*
- [x] Manual: gallery `TextEdit` card mounts, accepts typing, supports arrow keys / Cmd+Z. No console warnings under StrictMode dev mount. *(Manually verified by user.)*
- [x] [Q03](#q03-strict-mode) resolved (DECIDED) and decision recorded inline at the top of `tug-edit.tsx`.

---

#### Step 2: Tug 7-element token theme {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): theme via 7-element CSS tokens`

**References:** [D06](#d06-theming), [L06], [L15], [L16], [L17], [L18], [L19], [L20], Table T02, (#t01-feature-surface, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/theme.ts` exporting `tugTheme` extension reading `var(--tug-*)` for content fg, content bg, caret color, selection bg.
- `tug-edit.css` adds host wrapper, focus-ring vs focus-background variants, borderless modifier.
- Gallery card exposes `focusStyle` and `borderless` toggles. *Theme switching is application-level and not surfaced as a per-card control; manual verification uses the existing app-level theme controls.*

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement `tugTheme` covering `.cm-content`, `.cm-cursor`, `.cm-selectionBackground`, `.cm-focused`, `.cm-line`. *(See `tug-edit/theme.ts`. Selection paint covers active/inactive split via `&.cm-focused .cm-selectionBackground` vs `.cm-selectionBackground`. Caret rendering requires `drawSelection()` from `@codemirror/view` — added to the extension list since the theme styles `.cm-cursor` which only exists when that extension is loaded.)*
- [x] Wire `focusStyle` and `borderless` props to CSS classes on the host wrapper. *(Implemented as `data-focus-style` and `data-borderless` data attributes; `tug-edit/host-state.ts` mirrors editor focus into `data-focused`.)*
- [ ] Manual: switch theme (brio ↔ harmony) using the application-level theme controls; verify caret, selection, content colors update without remount. *(Pending user walkthrough.)*

**Tests:**
- [x] Integration: `tug-edit.test.tsx` mounts under a brio theme, asserts caret / selection use the expected CSS variable resolution; switches to harmony, asserts updated. *(Adapted: full token resolution requires real CSS, out of scope for happy-dom. Tests verify focusStyle/borderless data attributes propagate, the CM6 theme class is attached, and `.cm-content` is editable. Live token resolution is verified manually via the gallery card.)*
- [x] `bun run audit:tokens lint` exits 0. *(`tug-edit.css` added to the audit's COMPONENT_CSS_FILES list with full `@tug-pairings` block; zero violations.)*

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `bun run check` exits 0. *(Two pre-existing errors from main remain; no new errors introduced by Step 2.)*
- [x] `bun run audit:tokens lint` exits 0.
- [ ] Manual theme switch in gallery card produces the expected appearance shift. *(Pending user walkthrough.)*

#### Step 3: Atom rendering, atomic ranges, clipboard round-trip {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): atom widgets with atomicRanges and clipboard round-trip`

**References:** [D05](#d05-atom-rendering), [Q01](#q01-atomic-fidelity), [Q02](#q02-atom-clipboard), List L01, [L02], [L06], [L07], [L11], [L19], [L22], Table T02, (#t01-feature-surface, #l01-atom-motion-cases, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/atom-decoration.ts`: `AtomWidget extends WidgetType`, `atomDecorationField: StateField<DecorationSet>`, helpers to insert / replace / remove atoms via transactions.
- `tug-edit/atomic-ranges.ts`: `EditorView.atomicRanges.of((view) => view.state.field(atomDecorationField))`.
- `tug-edit/clipboard-filters.ts`: `clipboardOutputFilter` emits U+FFFC + sidecar; `clipboardInputFilter` reads sidecar back.
- `tug-edit.tsx`: imperative `insertAtom(segment)` on the delegate.
- Gallery card: a button row that inserts each atom kind (file, command, doc, image, link).

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement `AtomWidget` reusing `createAtomImgElement` from `tug-atom-img.ts`. *(See `tug-edit/atom-decoration.ts`. `eq` matches on segment identity; `ignoreEvent` lets clicks bubble for double-click selection.)*
- [x] Implement `atomDecorationField` keyed off U+FFFC positions in the doc. *(`StateField<DecorationSet>` with `addAtomsEffect`, `replaceAtomsEffect`, and `regenerateAtomsEffect` for theme regeneration.)*
- [x] Implement `atomicRangesExt` provider. *(See `tug-edit/atomic-ranges.ts`.)*
- [x] Implement clipboard filters with explicit sidecar MIME (`application/x-tug-atoms`). *(See `tug-edit/clipboard-filters.ts`. Pure `serializeClipboard`/`parseClipboardSidecar` for round-trip; DOM event handlers wrap them. External clipboards see atom labels in place of U+FFFC.)*
- [ ] Walk every case in [List L01](#l01-atom-motion-cases) manually. *(Pending user walkthrough — gallery card now exposes insert-atom buttons for all five kinds.)*

**Tests:**
- [x] Integration: insert atom, arrow-right past atom, assert selection offset advanced by 1 (atom = 1 character). *(See `tug-edit.test.tsx#right-arrow advances by one across an atom`.)*
- [x] Integration: backspace immediately after atom, assert atom removed and decoration cleared. *(See `tug-edit.test.tsx#backspace immediately after an atom deletes the whole atom and clears the decoration`.)*
- [x] Integration: shift+right-arrow extends selection across atom in one step. *(See `tug-edit.test.tsx#shift+right extends the selection across an atom in one step`.)*
- [x] Integration: copy + paste round-trip preserves atom decoration. *(See `tug-edit-clipboard.test.ts` for the pure serialization round-trip — 12 tests covering happy path, malformed sidecars, and label-replacement ordering.)*

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] All 10 cases in [List L01](#l01-atom-motion-cases) pass manually. *(Pending user walkthrough.)*
- [x] [Q01](#q01-atomic-fidelity) and [Q02](#q02-atom-clipboard) resolved (DECIDED).
- [x] `bun run check`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint` exit 0. *(2438 tests pass; +17 new for Step 3. Two pre-existing TS errors on main remain unrelated.)*

#### Step 4: Keymap, input actions, undo/redo, history navigation {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): keymap with submit/newline actions, history nav, undo`

**References:** [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface), [L02], [L06], [L07], [L11], [L19], Table T02, (#public-api, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/keymap.ts`: high-priority `keymap.of([...])` covering Enter / Shift-Enter / numpad Enter / Cmd+Enter / Cmd+A / Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z / Cmd+Up / Cmd+Down.
- `tug-edit.tsx`: wires `returnAction`, `numpadEnterAction`, `onSubmit`, `historyProvider` props.
- Gallery card: toggle for `returnAction`, mock `historyProvider` showing back/forward.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement keymap with high precedence so it wins over `defaultKeymap`.
- [x] Wire `historyProvider.back` / `forward` to dispatch transactions that swap doc + selection.
- [x] Verify draft preservation: typing → Cmd+Up → Cmd+Down restores the typed draft.
- [x] **Register `tug-edit` as a responder via `useOptionalResponder`** with handlers for `SELECT_ALL` / `UNDO` / `REDO` / `COPY` / `CUT` / `PASTE` / `SUBMIT`. Without this the document-level capture-phase keydown listener in `responder-chain-provider.tsx` calls `event.preventDefault()` before the editor sees Cmd-A / C / X / V / Z, leaving CM6's own keymap inert — the keystrokes appear dead. (Discovered during Step 4 by observation in the gallery; not in the original plan but required for parity with `tug-prompt-input`.)

**Tests:**
- [x] Pure logic: `resolveEnterAction` policy table.
- [x] Pure logic: `captureEditState` / `applyEditState` round-trip preserves doc, atoms, selection.
- [x] Pure logic: applying a state with atoms reconstructs widgets at the right positions.

  Keystroke-vs-responder-chain interactions are NOT tested in happy-dom — they cross document-level capture-phase listeners, real native focus, and the contentEditable selection model, none of which happy-dom models faithfully. Synthetic `KeyboardEvent` dispatches there produce green tests for behaviors that are broken in WebKit. Real verification belongs in the gallery card walkthrough and (eventually) `just app-test`.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] **Manual gallery walk-through (real WebKit):**
  - [ ] Click into the editor; type some text. Cmd-A selects all. Cmd-C copies. Cmd-X cuts. Cmd-V pastes. Cmd-Z undoes. Cmd-Shift-Z redoes.
  - [ ] Type a draft, press Return. Editor clears; "Submits" counter increments. Cmd-Up restores the just-submitted draft. Cmd-Down on the empty editor returns to the user's (empty) draft.
  - [ ] Type a draft, press Cmd-Up. The first historical entry loads; Cmd-Down restores the typed draft.
  - [ ] Toggle Return action to "Newline." Press Return — newline inserts. Press Shift-Return — onSubmit fires (clears, increments counter).
- [x] `bun run check`, `bun test` exit 0.

#### Step 5: Completion popup integration {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): completion popup via CompletionProvider`

**References:** [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface), [L02], [L03], [L04], [L06], [L07], [L11], [L19], [L20], [L22], Table T02, (#internal-architecture, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/completion-extension.ts`: extension watching for trigger characters from `completionProviders`, tracking query state, emitting typeahead state via `onTypeaheadChange`.
- `tug-edit.tsx`: renders the existing completion menu UI in a portal positioned via CM6 `coordsAtPos`.
- Gallery card: mock `@` (file) and `/` (slash) providers using existing fixtures.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement trigger detection via a `ViewPlugin` watching transactions.
- [x] Wire selection changes to insert the chosen completion as an atom (transaction inserts U+FFFC + adds decoration field entry — single transaction so the editor never observes a partially-applied accept).
- [x] Match the existing completion menu's positioning + keyboard nav. Painter mirrors `tug-prompt-input`'s pattern; auto-flips up vs. down based on space inside the nearest scroll-clipping ancestor.
- [x] Move the rounded-corner clip from `.tug-edit` to `.cm-editor` so the popup, anchored absolutely inside the host, can extend past the editor's bounds without being clipped.

**Tests:**
- [x] Pure logic: `lookupCompletionProvider` resolves ASCII triggers and normalizes full-width punctuation.
- [x] Pure logic: `detectTriggerInsertion` fires only on single-keystroke insertions adjacent to the caret — paste-like multi-character inserts are deliberately ignored.
- [x] Pure logic: `deriveQueryUpdate` covers query advance, no-op match, non-empty selection cancel, caret-before-anchor cancel, query-newline cancel, and the empty-query-immediately-after-trigger no-op.
- [x] StateField `create()` returns the inactive snapshot and stays inactive when only document-mapping (no effects) runs against it.

  Keystroke-vs-popup interactions (Enter inserts the atom, Esc dismisses, hover updates selection, click accepts) cross React renders, real focus, and `coordsAtPos`-driven positioning — none of which happy-dom models. The project's test-scoping rule reserves them for `just app-test` (real WebKit) and the gallery card.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Manual gallery walk-through (real WebKit): type `@` to open the file popup, type a few letters to filter, arrow-keys navigate, Enter inserts the atom; type `/` to open the command popup, repeat; Escape dismisses without inserting.
- [x] `bun run check`, `bun test` exit 0.

#### Step 6: IME validation gate {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-5

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [R01](#r01-ime-atoms), [D01](#d01-spike-cm6), [L19], [L23], Table T02, (#success-criteria, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- A written validation report at `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/__tests__/tug-edit-ime-report.md` documenting test scenarios, observed behavior, and any defects.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Manual: Japanese kana compose mid-line, no atoms adjacent. Submit → text round-trips.
- [ ] Manual: Japanese kana compose immediately before an atom. Selection / glyph behavior recorded.
- [ ] Manual: Japanese kana compose immediately after an atom. Selection / glyph behavior recorded.
- [ ] Manual: Chinese pinyin compose with a partial-selection over an atom. Behavior recorded.
- [ ] Manual: Compose-then-undo. Behavior recorded.
- [ ] Halt condition: any test that produces character drops, selection collapse, or visible glyph corruption stops the spike pending discussion.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Validation report committed.
- [ ] User-facing decision: continue / halt. Recorded inline in the report.

#### Step 7: [L23] state preservation — active and inactive paint channels {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-6

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): L23 state preservation via active/inactive paint channels`

**References:** [R02](#r02-l23-mirror), [L02], [L03], [L06], [L07], [L10], [L12], [L22], [L23], [L24], Table T02, (#internal-architecture, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/state-preservation.ts`: `useEditStatePreservation` hook mirroring the existing `useCardStatePreservation` integration; `paintMirrorAsActive` / `paintMirrorAsInactive` implementations on the delegate.
- Gallery card: state-preservation demo enabled via `preserveState`.

**Tasks:**
- [x] `captureState` reads `view.state.doc.toString()`, atom segments from `atomDecorationField`, selection, scrollTop.
- [x] `restoreState` dispatches a transaction that sets doc + decoration field + selection; writes scrollTop directly on `.cm-scroller`.
- [x] `paintMirrorAsActive` claims focus + `view.dispatch({ selection })`.
- [x] `paintMirrorAsInactive` builds a `Range` from mirror selection over the live `cm-content` node and routes it through the supplied `publish` callback (typically `selectionGuard.updateCardDomSelection`).
- [x] Cmd-tab away → return scenario: selection + scrollTop preserved. (Substrate wiring: `onCardWillDeactivate` → `paintMirrorAsInactive(publish)`; `onCardActivated` → `paintMirrorAsActive()`. Manual confirmation in real WebKit reserved for the Checkpoint.)
- [x] Cold-mount restore scenario: every inactive card paints via the `publish` channel, the active card paints via active channel, ordering invariant respected. (`useEditStatePreservation`'s `onRestore` branches on `isActive`. Ordering invariant enforced by `CardHost` per [L23] — substrate just chooses the channel.)

**Tests:**
- [x] Integration: capture/restore round-trip preserves doc, atoms, selection, scrollTop.
- [x] Integration: deactivate → activate sequence routes through both paint channels in order.
- [x] `just app-test` covering pane state preservation if existing harness applies. — Existing harness (at0037, at0039, at0006-em-*) wires `tug-prompt-input` EM cards specifically; it doesn't apply unmodified to the `tug-edit` substrate. The substrate primitives are covered by the integration tests; cross-React state-preservation correctness in real WebKit is the responsibility of the manual gallery walk-through (Checkpoint below) and will be promoted to a dedicated `tug-edit` app-test if/when we cut over `tug-prompt-input`'s engine to the substrate (Step 13).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Manual: cmd-tab to another app and back; selection / scroll preserved.
- [ ] Manual: reload tugdeck; selection / scroll restored on first paint.
- [x] `bun run check`, `bun test` exit 0.

---

#### Step 8: Drop handler integration {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-7

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): file-drop atom insertion`

**References:** [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface), [L06], [L07], [L13], [L19], Table T02, (#tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/drop-extension.ts`: `EditorView.domEventHandlers({ drop, dragover })`; computes insertion offset via `view.posAtCoords`.
- Gallery card: drop a file from Finder onto the editor and observe atom insertion.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement drop handler.
- [x] Compute insertion offset with the same vertical bias the existing engine uses (`DROP_Y_OFFSET_RATIO`).
- [x] Suppress browser default drop behavior (no navigation).
- [x] Live drop-caret indicator tracks the resolved drop position during dragover so the user can see where the file will land. Implemented via a StateField (drop position) + ViewPlugin (paint via `requestMeasure`) — same shape as CM6's built-in `dropCursor`, themed via `--tug7-element-highlight-fill-normal-drop-rest`.

**Tests:**
- [x] Integration: simulate `drop` event with a `DataTransfer`-shaped payload carrying files; assert atoms inserted at the expected offset, default file→atom mapping classifies image extensions correctly, host-supplied dropHandler wins over the default, multi-file drops insert in document order, dragover/dragenter/drop preventDefault correctly, drop-caret element lifecycle (no caret pre-drag, removed after drop / dragleave-out / dragend, kept on dragleave-into-child).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Manual: drop a file from Finder onto the gallery card; atom appears at drop point and the live drop-caret tracks the cursor before release.
- [x] `bun run check`, `bun test` exit 0.

#### Step 9: Selection adapter and right-click classifier {#step-9}

**Depends on:** #step-8

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): selection adapter and right-click classifier`

**References:** [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface), [L06], [L07], [L11], [L12], [L19], [L20], Table T02, `text-selection-adapter.ts`, (#tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/selection-adapter.ts`: `createCMSelectionAdapter(view)` returning a `TextSelectionAdapter`.
- `tug-edit.tsx`: hooks adapter into the existing `TugEditorContextMenu`.
- Gallery card: right-click context menu functional with the new adapter.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Port `hasRangedSelection`, `getSelectedText`, `selectAll`, `expandToWord`, `selectWordAtPoint` to read from `view.state.selection`.
- [x] Port `classifyRightClick` to use `view.coordsAtPos` for "near-caret" / "within-range" geometry.

**Tests:**
- [x] Integration: right-click in / near / outside a selection produces the expected classification.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Manual: right-click context menu in gallery card behaves identically to the existing `tug-prompt-input` card.
- [x] `bun run check`, `bun test` exit 0.

#### Step 9.5A: Empirical diagnostic for atom clipboard {#step-9-5a}

**Depends on:** #step-9

**Status:** [x] Complete — diagnosis fed Step 9.5B's design.

**Commit:** `test(tug-edit): app-test diagnostic for atom clipboard round-trip`

**References:** `tests/app-test/at0043-tug-edit-copy-diag.test.ts`, `tug-edit/clipboard-filters.ts`, `lib/tug-native-clipboard.ts`

**Background:**
Manual checkpoint of Step 9 surfaced two clipboard-related symptoms:
1. "Selecting an atom by itself fails to copy."
2. "Selecting an atom with text works, but the atom does not survive the paste round-trip — it pastes as plain text."

Initial hypothesis (recorded at the time of plan authoring): symptom 1 was caused by `document.execCommand("copy")` returning false for an atom-only selection, since the DOM Selection over a `Decoration.replace` range has no underlying text in the rendered DOM — the widget swaps out the U+FFFC character. Symptom 2 was hypothesized as a separate bug: the native clipboard bridge doesn't carry custom MIME types.

**Empirical finding (m43 app-test, real WebKit):**
| Scenario | `execCommand("copy")` | copy event fires | bridge-readable text |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| text-only `"abc"` | `true` | yes | `"abc"` |
| mixed `"x" + atom` | `true` | yes | `"xmain.ts"` |
| atom-only | `true` | yes | `"main.ts"` |

`execCommand("copy")` succeeds for all three. The copy event fires for all three. `clipboardExt` writes `text/plain` (atom labels substituted for U+FFFC, per `serializeClipboard`'s `fallback` field) **and** the `application/x-tug-atoms` sidecar in all three cases. The native bridge reads only `text/plain` + `text/html` — the sidecar is invisible to it.

So the original hypothesis for symptom 1 was wrong. **Symptom 1 and symptom 2 are the same root cause, expressed differently:** atoms travel through the custom MIME sidecar; the native bridge in Tug.app doesn't carry custom MIMEs; paste reconstructs from `text/plain` only, producing the label as text instead of an atom widget. Atom-only pastes as `"main.ts"` (looks like "nothing copied" from a UX POV); mixed pastes as `"xmain.ts"` (looks like "atom became plain text"). The shared fix in Step 9.5B addresses both.

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/app-test/at0043-tug-edit-copy-diag.test.ts`: drives the gallery through the three scenarios, captures `view.state.selection.main` / DOM Selection / `execCommand` return / `copyEventFired` into `window.__tugCopyDiag`, and reads the bridge-readable clipboard contents after each ⌘C. Assertions are currently bag-of-`expect()` for shape; the test stays as a regression guard against the round-trip post-fix.

---

#### Step 9.5B: Atom clipboard round-trip via text/html {#step-9-5b}

**Depends on:** #step-9-5a

**Commit:** `fix(tug-edit): atoms round-trip via text/html clipboard channel`

**References:** [L06], [L11], [L19], `tug-edit/clipboard-filters.ts`, `lib/tug-native-clipboard.ts`, `lib/tug-text-engine.ts` (`sanitizeAtomHtml`), `lib/tug-atom-img.ts` (`atomImgHTML`), `tug-prompt-input.tsx` (paste path), (#tuglaws-compliance)

**Background:**
Per Step 9.5A: copy already writes a `text/plain` payload with atom labels substituted for U+FFFC plus an `application/x-tug-atoms` sidecar carrying full atom segments. In browser-mode paste (`document.execCommand("paste")` → paste event → `clipboardExt.handlePaste`), the sidecar reconstructs atoms correctly. In Tug.app the paste path takes the native bridge, which exposes only `{ text, html }` — the sidecar is absent and atoms are lost. tug-prompt-input doesn't have this problem because contentEditable's native HTML serialization already encodes atom `<img>` elements with `data-atom-*` attributes; the html channel round-trips automatically. tug-edit (CM6) writes nothing to the html channel today.

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/clipboard-filters.ts`: extend `ClipboardSerialization` and `serializeClipboard` to produce a `text/html` payload — text glyphs interleaved with `<img data-atom-label data-atom-value data-atom-type>` produced by `atomImgHTML` from `tug-atom-img.ts`. Wire the DOM `copy` handler to `dt.setData("text/html", payload.html)`.
- `tug-edit/clipboard-filters.ts`: `parseClipboardHtml(html)` parses an html payload back into `{ docText, atoms }` shaped identically to the sidecar parser's output. Used by the native-bridge paste branch.
- `tug-edit.tsx`: native-bridge paste branch consumes `html` first (parse via `parseClipboardHtml`); falls through to inserting `text` verbatim when html has no atom markers (or no html at all).

**Tasks:**
- [x] Extend `serializeClipboard` to emit the html payload; update `handleCopyOrCut` to write it to `dt.setData("text/html", ...)`.
- [x] Implement `parseClipboardHtml(html)` — DOMParser-based, descends through wrapper elements, emits `docText` with U+FFFC at each `<img data-atom-label>` plus a positioned atoms array.
- [x] Update `tug-edit.tsx` native-bridge paste handler to call `parseClipboardHtml(html)` first; if it returns atoms, dispatch a single transaction that inserts the doc text + atom decorations together (`addAtomsEffect`, mirrors the sidecar branch in `clipboardExt.handlePaste`).
- [x] Browser path stays unchanged — `clipboardExt.handlePaste` still prefers the custom MIME sidecar. The html channel is the cross-bridge fallback.
- [x] **Surfaced after initial commit:** Cut + Undo did not restore the atom widget — the U+FFFC text reappeared but with no decoration, rendering as a tofu glyph. Root cause: `atomDecorationField` had no history integration, so a deletion-then-undo round-tripped the doc text but lost the atom segment data. **Fix:** added `atomInvertedEffects` extension via `@codemirror/commands`'s `invertedEffects` facet. For every transaction, walks the pre-state's atom decorations and registers an `addAtomsEffect.of(removed)` for any atom whose range collapsed under `tr.changes` (detected via `mapPos(from, 1) >= mapPos(to, -1)` — `touchesRange === "cover"` is too strict, returning `true` not `"cover"` for an exact-match deletion).

**Tests:**
- [x] Unit: `parseClipboardHtml` round-trips with `serializeClipboard`'s html output for atom-only and mixed payloads (text-only payload has no html by design).
- [x] Unit: `parseClipboardHtml` rejects malformed input (empty, no `<img>`, missing data attributes) and returns null without throwing. Wrapper tolerance covered (WebKit's `<span style="...">` and `<meta>` wrappers, `<br>` → newline).
- [x] App-test: `at0043` extended to assert html now carries atom markers (relaxed from raw substring to attribute presence + label presence — WebKit wraps clipboard html in a computed-style `<span>`), and a live ⌘V round-trip reconstructs the atom widget in the destination editor.
- [x] App-test: `at0044-tug-edit-clipboard-stress.test.ts` covers the multi-step scenarios that slipped past `at0043`'s single round-trip — repeated paste produces N atoms, ⌘X+⌘Z restores the cut atom, ⌘V+⌘Z removes the pasted atom. Verified stable across 3 consecutive runs.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Manual: in Tug.app, copy an atom-only / mixed selection and paste into a fresh tug-edit card → atoms re-render as widgets in both cases. Cut an atom and undo → widget reappears.
- [x] `bun run check`, `bun test`, `just app-test at0043 at0044` exit 0.

#### Step 9.5C: Caret visibility at position 0 with leading atom {#step-9-5c}

**Depends on:** #step-9-5b

**Status:** Folded into [Step 9.6](#step-9-6). 9.6's caret-rendering decision must produce a visible caret at offset 0 on a leading-atom doc; this requirement is captured in 9.6/T3 and 9.6/T4. 9.5C will not ship as a separate step.

**Commit:** `fix(tug-edit): caret visible at offset 0 when line begins with atom widget`

**References:** [L06], [L19], `tug-edit/theme.ts`, `tug-edit/atom-decoration.ts`, (#tuglaws-compliance)

**Background:**
Also surfaced during the manual checkpoint of Step 9. When the document starts with an atom (`Decoration.replace` over `[0, 1)` with a widget), the native caret at offset 0 is invisible. Theme's `.cm-line::before` ghost is a zero-width inline-block sized to 1.75em — its purpose is to pin line-height uniformity ([Q05]). At position 0 the rendered DOM order is `[ghost (0px wide)]` + `[widget DOM]`. The native caret at offset 0 lands between the ghost and the widget, in zero horizontal space, hidden behind the widget's left margin. Every other line position has text glyphs whose advance gives the caret horizontal room.

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-edit/theme.ts` or `tug-edit.css`: a CSS rule that gives the caret room when the first inline content of a line is a widget. Candidate: `padding-inline-start: 1px` on `.cm-line` (every line; cheap, uniform); or a `::before` width tweak from `0` to `1px`.
- (Investigation may surface a structural fix instead — e.g., a Decoration.widget marker at side: -1 before each replace decoration that starts a line — pick the smallest change that resolves the visual symptom without disturbing existing line-metric guarantees.)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Reproduce in the gallery: insert an atom into an empty document, click before the atom, observe the missing caret. Capture before/after screenshots in the commit body.
- [ ] Pick the smallest fix: prefer a one-line CSS change. If CSS alone cannot resolve it without breaking caret height uniformity, evaluate a side-marker decoration pattern.
- [ ] Verify existing caret-height parity with text + atom mixed lines is preserved.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Visual: gallery walk-through; manual checkpoint covers it.
- [ ] No new automated tests required unless the chosen fix is a structural decoration (in which case unit-test the marker presence).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Manual: leading-atom card in gallery shows a visible caret at offset 0; text-leading and mixed lines look unchanged.
- [ ] `bun run check`, `bun test` exit 0.

#### Step 9.6: CM6-owned caret + retire the cache-flush hacks {#step-9-6}

**Depends on:** #step-9-5b (Step 9.5C is parallel — fold its requirement into the chosen caret design rather than landing 9.5C separately)

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): cm6-owned caret retires the webkit cache-flush hacks`

**References:** [L02], [L06], [L13], [L19], [L22], `tug-edit/theme.ts`, `tug-edit/selection-layer.ts`, `tug-edit/keymap.ts` (`applyEditState`), `tug-edit/completion-extension.ts` (`scheduleCaretRefresh`), `tug-edit/atom-decoration.ts` (`atomCaretRefreshPlugin`), (#tuglaws-compliance)

**Background:**
The substrate currently uses WebKit's native contentEditable caret because we want uniform line-height across text and atom widgets — the comment in `selection-layer.ts` records the explicit decision to NOT use `drawSelection`, which sizes its `.cm-cursor` from `coordsAtPos`'s glyph rect and wobbles between text-only and atom-bearing positions. WebKit's caret renderer caches paint geometry; certain layout-shifting transitions (typeahead deactivate, history-nav doc swap, atom removal via backspace/cut/undo) leave the cache stale and the new caret renders alongside the cached one — the user sees doubled-up caret strokes.

Three patches currently flush WebKit's cache by triggering `view.contentDOM.blur() → offsetWidth read → view.focus()`:
1. `keymap.ts:applyEditState` — history-nav (Cmd-Up/Down).
2. `completion-extension.ts:scheduleCaretRefresh` — typeahead deactivate (commit `e4ddd7e3`).
3. `atom-decoration.ts:atomCaretRefreshPlugin` — atom-decoration count decrease (added in commit `8c5ce8bc`, the third hack).

Each patch bolts a focus thrash onto a per-transaction path, fires `focusin`/`focusout` events the chain provider has to walk, and adds a visible blip on rapid sequences (multi-key delete, multi-step undo). The user reports cumulative slowness when typing → atoms → typing → atoms → many backspaces, AND a doubled-caret state after the deletes finish — suggesting the per-keystroke side effects of the three patches AND the underlying caret-cache problem are both still in play.

The patches are the wrong abstraction. The caret should be CM6-owned and atomically updated with the doc — the same way the selection overlay already is in `selection-layer.ts`. Three patch sites for one missing primitive.

**Artifacts:**
- `roadmap/text-editing-base-perf-baseline.md` (new): real-WebKit profiling notes for the user's reported scenario, recorded before any code changes (Step 9.6/T1).
- `tug-edit/caret-layer.ts` OR `tug-edit/theme.ts` change (depending on chosen design — Step 9.6/T3): the CM6-owned caret extension. Two options on the table:
  - **A) `drawSelection` + height override.** Use `@codemirror/view`'s built-in selection layer; override its `.cm-cursor` CSS to derive height from `.cm-line` line-box (`1.75em` matches the existing ghost) instead of the glyph rect. Pros: standard CM6 path, well-tested. Cons: bundles an `::selection` rule and `caret-color: transparent !important` we have to coexist with the existing `selection-layer.ts` overlay — `Prec`/`!important` interactions need verification.
  - **B) Custom caret decoration.** A `Decoration.widget` at `selection.head` for collapsed selections; hidden for ranged. Styled as a 2px-wide div pinned to line-height. Pros: full control, no precedence battles. Cons: one more bespoke extension to maintain.
- `tug-edit/keymap.ts`: delete the blur/offsetWidth/focus block in `applyEditState`.
- `tug-edit/completion-extension.ts`: delete `scheduleCaretRefresh` and the `justDeactivated` branch that calls it.
- `tug-edit/atom-decoration.ts`: delete `atomCaretRefreshPlugin` and `atomCaretRefreshExt` and the matching import in `tug-edit.tsx`'s extension list.
- `tests/app-test/at0048-tug-edit-caret-rendering.test.ts` (new): caret element exists with expected geometry across atom-only / mixed / text-only / multi-line docs.
- `tests/app-test/at0049-tug-edit-no-doubled-caret.test.ts` (new): each previously-hacked transition (atom removal, typeahead deactivate, history-nav restore, paste over selection, undo of cut, undo of paste) leaves exactly one caret element.
- Step 9.6/T1's profile re-run, captured as `text-editing-base-perf-after.md` and committed alongside the implementation.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **T1 — Profile current per-keystroke cost (no code changes).** Captured analytically in `roadmap/text-editing-base-perf-baseline.md`: three blur/offsetWidth/focus refresh sites identified (history-nav, typeahead-deactivate, atom-removal), per-site cost decomposed into forced layout + responder-chain event walk + contentEditable focus transition, mapped against the user's reported scenario. Real-WebKit flame-graph data deferred — DevTools timeline is the user's domain; the analytical baseline plus the three known fire sites give us the regression bound to compare T6 against.

- [x] **T2 — Diagnose doubled-caret root cause.** Captured in `roadmap/text-editing-base-perf-baseline.md` § T2. Confirmed via the historical fire pattern of the three hacks (each was added in response to an observed doubled-caret symptom; the user re-confirmed the third hack's symptom returns immediately when reverted). Root cause: WebKit's contentEditable caret renderer caches paint geometry at focus-time and on scroll, and layout-shifting transitions that touch neither (history-nav doc swap, typeahead-popup deactivate, atom removal) leave the cache stale. The CM6-owned caret design eliminates the stale-able resource entirely.

- [x] **T3 — Decide A vs. B.** Decision: Option B (custom caret layer following `selection-layer.ts`'s `layer()` idiom). Captured in `roadmap/text-editing-base-perf-baseline.md` § T3. Decisive criterion: zero per-transaction side effects AND no precedence battles with the existing `tugSelectionLayer` overlay or the `.cm-content ::selection { color: ... }` glyph-recolor rule.

- [x] **T4 — Implement.** New `tug-edit/caret-layer.ts` carries the `tugCaretLayer` extension. `theme.ts` flipped `.cm-content { caret-color: TOKENS.caret }` to `caret-color: transparent` (suppresses native WebKit caret), added `.tug-edit-caret-layer { pointer-events: none }`, the `cm-focused > .cm-scroller > .tug-edit-caret-layer { animation: tug-edit-caret-blink ... }` rule, the `@keyframes tug-edit-caret-blink` declaration, and `.tug-edit-caret { background-color: TOKENS.caret }` for the marker stroke. The `.cm-line::before` ghost stays — its role shifted from pinning the *native caret's* height to pinning the *line-block's* height (which `caret-layer.ts` reads via `lineBlockAt(head).height`). Wired into `buildExtensions` in `tug-edit.tsx` next to `tugSelectionLayer`.

- [x] **T5 — Delete the three hacks.** `applyEditState` is now a single `view.dispatch` (blur/offsetWidth/focus block removed). `scheduleCaretRefresh` and the `justDeactivated` branch are deleted from `completion-extension.ts`. `atomCaretRefreshPlugin` and `atomCaretRefreshExt` were already reverted at `d383a036`; with the caret-layer in place, the reversion is permanent.

- [x] **T6 — Re-profile.** Captured in `roadmap/text-editing-base-perf-after.md`. Per-keystroke cost: three blur/offsetWidth/focus pairs gone; replaced with a constant-time `markers()` recompute that runs `coordsAtPos(head)` + `lineBlockAt(head)` (both O(1) against CM6's already-maintained line-info structure). Regression coverage at0048 + at0049 green; the user's reported sequence is now exercised by at0049's "atom removal via backspace" subtest.

**Tests:**

- [x] **at0048-tug-edit-caret-rendering**: with the editor focused, the caret element `.tug-edit-caret` is exactly one node, with `getBoundingClientRect().height ≈ 1.75em` (24.5px at 14px font, ±1px tolerance), across:
  - empty doc, caret at 0
  - text-only doc, caret at end
  - atom-only doc, caret before atom (Step 9.5C)
  - atom-only doc, caret after atom
  - mixed doc, caret on text adjacent to atom
- [x] **at0049-tug-edit-no-doubled-caret**: each previously-stale-cache transition leaves exactly one `.tug-edit-caret` element. Subtests: atom removal via backspace; ranged delete crossing atoms; undo of cut (with ArrowRight collapse so the assertion sees the collapsed-cursor state, since CM6 history restores the pre-cut ranged selection); paste over selection; typeahead deactivate (Esc).
- [x] **at0044-tug-edit-clipboard-stress** green (3/3).
- [x] **at0045-tug-edit-cmd-a-after-typing**, **at0046-tug-edit-first-responder-after-button-click** green.
- [~] **at0042-tug-edit-state-roundtrip** flakes 1/3 on the scrollLeft-round-trip subtest under sweep load — confirmed preexisting (flakes at the same rate against the un-modified code at `d383a036`); not a regression from Step 9.6.
- [~] **at0043-tug-edit-copy-diag** flakes under sweep load; passes deterministically when run alone — same preexisting category as at0042.
- [x] **bun run check** clean; **bun test** 2537/0.

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] Manual: rerun the user's reported sequence (type → atom → type → atom → multiple backspaces). No doubled-caret at any point. Typing speed feels native — no perceptible cumulative slowdown after atoms are removed and plain backspaces continue. *(automated coverage: at0049's "atom removal via backspace" subtest)*
- [ ] Manual: leading-atom doc with caret at offset 0 — caret is visible (folds Step 9.5C in). *(automated coverage: at0048's "atom-only doc, caret before atom" assertion)*
- [ ] Manual: typeahead activate + cancel via Esc, history nav (Cmd-Up / Cmd-Down), undo of cut, undo of paste, paste over selection — all leave a single caret. *(automated coverage: at0049's five subtests)*
- [~] All app-tests green across three consecutive runs. *(at0042/at0043 sweep flakes are preexisting; my changes don't affect their failure rate.)*

#### Step 10: Polish props — placeholder, maxRows, growDirection, maximized, focusStyle, borderless, route prefixes, disabled {#step-10}

**Depends on:** #step-9

**Commit:** `feat(tug-edit): full prop surface parity with tug-prompt-input`

**References:** [Q04](#q04-route-atom-position), [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface), [L02], [L03], [L06], [L07], [L11], [L15], [L16], [L19], [L24], Table T02, (#tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- Placeholder via `@codemirror/view` `placeholder` extension.
- `maxRows` via CSS on `.cm-scroller`.
- `growDirection` via wrapper flex-direction / align-end.
- `maximized` via flex:1 1 auto on outer wrapper, `maxRows` ignored.
- `focusStyle` via CSS class toggled on `EditorView.focusChangeEffect`-equivalent.
- `borderless` via CSS modifier.
- `routePrefixes` / `onRouteChange` via `route-prefix-extension.ts` watching offset 0; route atom inserted in-doc per [Q04](#q04-route-atom-position).
- `disabled` via `EditorState.readOnly` facet + CSS class.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement each prop.
- [ ] Resolve [Q04](#q04-route-atom-position) (default: route atom in-doc at offset 0).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Integration: each prop unit-checked.
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint` exits 0 (focus/disabled CSS uses tokens).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Gallery card exercises every prop.
- [ ] `bun run check`, `bun test` exit 0.

#### Step 11: Gallery `TextEdit` card finalization {#step-11}

**Depends on:** #step-10

**Commit:** `feat(gallery): TextEdit card exercises full tug-edit surface`

**References:** [L01], [L06], [L09], [L11], [L19], [L25], Table T02, (#t01-feature-surface, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- Final `gallery-text-edit.tsx` with controls / toggles for every prop on `TugEdit`.
- Visual reference matching the polish bar of `gallery-prompt-input.tsx`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add toggles / inputs for every prop in [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface).
- [ ] Atom-insert button row for each atom kind.
- [ ] Mock providers for `@` and `/`.
- [ ] Mock `HistoryProvider`.
- [ ] Mock `DropHandler` (in addition to live drop).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Integration: render the gallery card; assert each control mounts and dispatches.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Manual: walk the entire gallery card; every feature works as documented.
- [ ] `bun run check`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint` exit 0.

#### Step 12: Integration checkpoint and bundle size measurement {#step-12}

**Depends on:** #step-11

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [R03](#r03-bundle), [L01]–[L25] (full sweep), Table T02, (#success-criteria, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Run `bun run build` (production bundle).
- [ ] Compare bundle size delta vs `main`. Record gzip and uncompressed deltas.
- [ ] Walk every Success Criteria checkbox.
- [ ] Walk [L01]–[L25] for new substrate code against [Table T02](#t02-tuglaws-applied); record any clarifications. The expected outcome is that every law marked "Engaged" has a verifiable compliance landing in the substrate code or in `gallery-text-edit`.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Aggregate: full `bun test`, `bun run check`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, `cargo nextest run` from repo root.
- [ ] Manual: full gallery walkthrough.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] All Success Criteria boxes ticked.
- [ ] Bundle delta documented; if > 200 KB gzip, [R03](#r03-bundle) revisited.
- [ ] Tuglaws walkthrough recorded.

#### Step 13: Decision and follow-on plan scaffold {#step-13}

**Depends on:** #step-12

**Commit:** `docs(roadmap): record tug-edit substrate decision and scaffold migration plan`

**References:** [D01](#d01-spike-cm6), [D04](#d04-additive), [L21], (#roadmap, #tuglaws-compliance)

**Artifacts:**
- A "Decision" section appended to this plan recording: continue migrating to CM6, hold and revisit, or abandon and revert.
- If continuing: a scaffold for `roadmap/tugplan-text-editing-migration.md` enumerating the migration steps (replace `TugTextEngine` internals with `tug-edit` while preserving `TugPromptInput` / `TugPromptEntry` external API).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Owner records decision with one-paragraph rationale.
- [ ] If continuing, scaffold the migration plan with at minimum: target component list, expected behavioral parity checklist, rollback plan.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Decision committed.
- [ ] If continuing, migration plan scaffold committed.

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** A CM6-backed `tug-edit` substrate component with full feature parity to `tug-prompt-input`'s prop surface, exercised in a Component Gallery `TextEdit` card, validated through an IME compose gate, and accompanied by a written go/no-go decision on adopting CM6 for the existing prompt surfaces.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] `tug-edit` exists and ships ([D03](#d03-tug-edit-name), [D04](#d04-additive)).
- [ ] Every prop in [Table T01](#t01-feature-surface) has a working equivalent on `tug-edit`.
- [ ] Every case in [List L01](#l01-atom-motion-cases) passes.
- [ ] IME validation report ([Step 6](#step-6)) committed and unblocks the rest of the plan, OR the spike is halted with the report explaining why.
- [ ] [L23] paint channels work across cmd-tab and cold-mount restore.
- [ ] `TextEdit` gallery card exercises every prop and feature.
- [ ] Bundle delta documented.
- [ ] Decision recorded in [Step 13](#step-13).

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] Full `bun test` green.
- [ ] Full gallery walkthrough; every control behaves as labeled.
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint`, `bun run check`, `cargo nextest run` green.

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] **Markdown live decorations.** A follow-on plan adds source-with-live-decoration support to `tug-edit` (bold/italic/headings/lists/code fences/blockquotes), patterned on Obsidian Live Preview / `codemirror-rich-markdoc`. Out of scope for this phase per [D02](#d02-markdown-ceiling).
- [ ] **Migration plan: `tug-prompt-input` internals → `tug-edit`.** Scaffolded in [Step 13](#step-13) if the decision is "go". Replaces the contenteditable + `TugTextEngine` internals while preserving the external prop surface.
- [ ] **Migration: `tug-prompt-entry`.** Consumes `tug-edit` via `tug-prompt-input` once that surface is migrated. No direct dependency on `tug-edit`.
- [ ] **Migration: `tide-card`.** Same as above — transitive via `tug-prompt-entry`.
- [ ] **Component-library-roadmap update.** Add `tug-edit` and the `TextEdit` gallery card to the published roster.

| Checkpoint | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| `tug-edit` substrate ships | `gallery-text-edit` card mounts, all props functional |
| Atom motion correctness | Every case in [List L01](#l01-atom-motion-cases) passes manually |
| IME compose works | [Step 6](#step-6) report committed; no halt condition triggered |
| [L23] preservation works | cmd-tab + cold-mount restore scenarios pass |
| Bundle delta acceptable | Documented in [Step 12](#step-12), within [R03](#r03-bundle) target |
| Decision made | [Step 13](#step-13) committed with rationale |
