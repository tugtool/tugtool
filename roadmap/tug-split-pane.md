# tug-split-pane

*A flexible split-pane layout primitive that divides a region into two or more resizable children, separated by draggable sashes that can snap closed and reopen.*

Motivation: in T3.4 we will place `tug-prompt-entry` at the bottom of the Tide card and `tug-markdown-view` above it. We need a reusable, meticulously-crafted split surface before that work — not a one-off layout in the Tide card. `tug-split-pane` becomes a general tugways layout primitive that any card composition can use.

---

## Goals

- **Horizontal or vertical splits.** A split is named by the orientation of its *dividing line*: `horizontal` = a horizontal sash dividing top/bottom panes, `vertical` = a vertical sash dividing left/right panes. This matches macOS / VS Code terminology and the user's mental model ("horizontally-split card with a markdown view on top").
- **N-way panes.** Two is the common case but the API supports arbitrary `n ≥ 2`. Nested split panes yield arbitrary 2D layouts.
- **Resizable sashes.** Drag to resize. Keyboard accessible (arrow keys when sash is focused). ARIA `separator` role.
- **Per-pane size constraints.** Each pane declares `minSize` and optional `maxSize`, in pixels or percentage. The group enforces them during drag and on container resize.
- **Snap-to-close.** When a pane is dragged below a snap threshold, it collapses to `collapsedSize` (usually 0). Reopening is via drag or imperative API.
- **Stylable sash.** The sash is a tokened element that accepts a width (thickness), color, and optional icon (grip indicator). Hover / active / focus states are CSS tokens.
- **Persistent layouts.** Optional `storageKey` saves the split ratio across reloads.
- **Composable with TugBox.** Each pane's content is opaque — typically a TugBox, but anything is allowed. The split pane does not impose visual chrome on its children.

Non-goals: animation choreography during snap (we use plain CSS transitions), multi-touch, drag-to-reorder panes.

## Research

**Radix UI — not applicable.** Radix has no split-pane or resizable primitive. Their focus is controls and dialogs, not layout. Confirmed against the Radix Primitives catalogue (`@radix-ui/react-accordion`, `-slider`, `-popover`, etc.; no `-split-pane`, `-panels`, or `-resizable`).

**Candidate 1 — `react-resizable-panels`** (Brian Vaughn / bvaughn). License: MIT. Active, ~5.2k stars, 160+ releases.
- Horizontal + vertical, nestable, keyboard-accessible separator (WAI-ARIA).
- Collapsible panels with `collapsible`, `collapsedSize`, and `onCollapse` callbacks — our "snap to close" requirement maps directly.
- Min / max / default sizes as percentages.
- Persistent layout via `autoSaveId` + local storage.
- Styling: class names and `data-*` attributes on the separator; the consumer supplies all visuals. A minor caveat — the library enforces `flex-grow`/`flex-shrink` on panels; thickness of the sash is free but panel size during drag is driven via inline style on flex items.
- Used by shadcn/ui's "Resizable" component, which is the closest analog in the React ecosystem to how tugways wraps Radix. Pattern-compatible: renderless-ish primitives + consumer styling.

**Candidate 2 — `allotment`** (John Walley). License: MIT. Active, derived from VS Code's split-view.
- Horizontal + vertical, nestable, keyboard accessible.
- Built-in "snap to zero" threshold + double-click sash to reset to preferred sizes.
- Ref-based imperative API (`.reset()`, `.resize()`).
- CSS variables for theming sash color / focus ring.
- Closer to the VS Code "industry standard" look. More opinionated about visual chrome, which is both a pro (great defaults) and con (harder to re-skin into tugways tokens).

**Candidate 3 — `react-split-pane` / `react-split` / `@devbookhq/splitter`.** Older, less maintained, or wrap non-React libraries. Not recommended.

**Candidate 4 — hand-rolled.** The resize math is not hard: constrained 1D layout with min/max clamping and optional snapping. What *is* hard, and what these libraries already solve, is the long tail:
- WAI-ARIA `separator` semantics and keyboard navigation
- Pointer capture across the viewport (drags that leave the target)
- Touch + mouse + pen unification
- `ResizeObserver` integration for container-size changes
- Persistent layouts + responsive reflow
- Edge cases around zero-size panels and conditional visibility

Rolling our own means re-solving these. Given we are already comfortable wrapping Radix primitives with tugways chrome, the same pattern applies here.

**Recommendation: wrap `react-resizable-panels`.** It is MIT, actively maintained, pattern-compatible with our Radix-wrapping conventions, and exposes primitives that map cleanly onto the props we want. Allotment is a reasonable fallback if its VS Code ergonomics (double-click reset, built-in snap threshold) turn out to matter more than class-based styling freedom — but our experience wrapping Radix slider, tooltip, popover, etc. with fully-tokened CSS strongly favors the Vaughn library.

### L06 note

`react-resizable-panels` drives panel sizes via inline `flex-grow`/`flex-shrink` on the panel elements and tracks layout in React state. During a drag, this causes React re-renders at pointer-event cadence. This is the same tradeoff as `@radix-ui/react-slider` (which we already wrap) — the intermediate values are technically appearance-only, but the upstream library routes them through React. We accept this tradeoff because:
1. The re-renders are narrow (the panel group and direct children only, not the content subtrees — children are memoized via `React.memo` where appropriate).
2. The committed layout *is* data (it persists, it's queryable, it drives which pane is collapsed), so having it in React is correct per L06's test.
3. The during-drag preview is visually indistinguishable from a pure CSS approach at 60fps on our hardware targets.

If profiling reveals drag-time jank inside heavy panes (a very large `tug-markdown-view`, for instance), the mitigation is to put the content in its own memoized boundary — not to rip out the library.

---

## Terminology

We deliberately name orientation by the *dividing line*, not the arrangement of panes. Both terms are used in the wild and each is someone's "wrong", so we pick one and stick to it:

| Prop value    | Dividing line | Pane arrangement |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| `horizontal`  | Horizontal    | Stacked (top / bottom) |
| `vertical`    | Vertical      | Side by side (left / right) |

This matches NSSplitView's semantics (`NSSplitViewDividerStyle` + `isVertical`: a vertical divider yields side-by-side panes) and VS Code's split terminology. The JSDoc on the `orientation` prop spells this out explicitly with a diagram so there is no confusion.

---

## Use case: Tide card

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Tide                              [x]  │  ← card title bar
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  tug-markdown-view                      │  ← pane 1
│  (scrolled content, history, etc.)      │
│                                         │
├──────── ═════ ─────────────────────────┤  ← horizontal sash (grip)
│                                         │
│  tug-prompt-entry                       │  ← pane 2
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Behavior:
- Default split: 70/30 (top is larger).
- Minimum for the prompt-entry pane: enough to show one line of input + route indicator + submit button (≈ 80px depending on size).
- Maximum for the prompt-entry pane: ~50% (user can still see recent history).
- Minimum for the markdown-view pane: enough to show ~3 lines of content.
- No snap-to-close in this specific layout — both panes are always needed. Snap-to-close is available for other cards that want it (e.g., an inspector that collapses).

### Why two components (`TugSplitPane` + `TugSplitPanel`)

Because size constraints are *per pane*. Putting them on the parent would require parallel-array props (`minSizes={[100, 50]}`), which is brittle. The `react-resizable-panels` API uses the same pattern (Group + Panel + Separator), and it is the clearest way to express "this specific child has these constraints." The sash is not a separate JSX element that authors mount — `TugSplitPane` renders one between each adjacent pair of panels automatically. Authors customize sash appearance once via the `sash` prop.

### Why the sash config is on the parent, not the panel

A sash lives *between* two panels, so it does not belong to either of them. Putting sash configuration on a panel would make it ambiguous ("leading? trailing?") and would force authors to duplicate styling on every panel. The parent-level `sash` config is the natural place for this.

---

## Snap behavior

1. User drags the sash toward a panel that is `collapsible: true`.
2. As the panel's size approaches its `minSize`, drag continues to shrink it normally.
3. Once the pointer has traveled `snapThreshold` pixels past `minSize`, the panel snaps to `collapsedSize` (typically 0) and `onCollapsedChange(true)` fires.
4. On the return drag, the panel reopens from `collapsedSize` directly to `minSize` once the pointer has traveled `snapThreshold` pixels *back* from the collapsed edge. This matches macOS / VS Code split behavior.
5. Programmatic expand/collapse is available via ref (`.collapsePanel(id)`, `.expandPanel(id)`).

Collapsed panels remain mounted (`display: none` is *not* used) so that their internal state is preserved. We toggle a `data-collapsed` attribute and drive the visual collapse with CSS: `.tug-split-panel[data-collapsed="true"] { flex: 0 0 0 !important; overflow: hidden; }`.

---

## Sash design

```
Horizontal sash (panes stacked top/bottom):
 ────────────────────────────────────
              ╺━━━╸               ← optional grip icon, centered
 ────────────────────────────────────

Vertical sash (panes side by side):
 │   │
 │ ╻ │
 │ ┃ │  ← optional grip icon, centered
 │ ╹ │
 │   │
```

- **Visible thickness** is token-driven (`--tug7-split-sash-thickness`) with sensible defaults per size variant.
- **Hit area** is wider than the visible thickness using negative margin / `::before` absolute positioning. Pattern: a 2px visible bar with a 10px hit area feels premium.
- **Grip icon** is optional. Defaults to `grip-horizontal` / `grip-vertical` from Lucide when `sash.icon` is not passed. Color and size inherit from tokens.
- **States** (CSS only, no React state): rest, hover, active (dragging), focus-visible (keyboard).
- **Cursor**: `ns-resize` for horizontal sashes, `ew-resize` for vertical sashes. Applied during hover and forced on `<body>` during drag (the underlying library handles the body-cursor escalation).
- **ARIA**: `role="separator"`, `aria-orientation`, `aria-valuenow`, `aria-valuemin`, `aria-valuemax` (provided by the underlying library). Focusable with Tab; Arrow keys move it by a fixed step (default 10px), Home/End move to min/max, Enter toggles collapse on collapsible panels.

## Files

```
tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-split-pane.tsx
tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-split-pane.css
tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/gallery-split-pane.tsx
```

Plus the dependency: `bun add react-resizable-panels`.

---

## TSX structure

- CSS import first
- `forwardRef` on `TugSplitPane` root; returned ref exposes imperative methods (`collapsePanel`, `expandPanel`, `getLayout`, `setLayout`) by forwarding to the underlying `PanelGroup` ref
- `data-slot="tug-split-pane"` on the root, `data-slot="tug-split-panel"` on each panel, `data-slot="tug-split-sash"` on each sash
- `cn()` for class composition
- Spread `...rest` on the root
- Wraps `react-resizable-panels`' `PanelGroup`, `Panel`, `PanelResizeHandle`
- `TugSplitPanel` is a thin wrapper around `Panel` that also carries the tugways `TugSplitPanelProps` interface and forwards the size/constraint props
- Sash is rendered internally by `TugSplitPane` by interleaving `<PanelResizeHandle>` elements between consecutive `<TugSplitPanel>` children, reading the `sash` prop for styling. Children are validated at dev time (must all be `TugSplitPanel`, no arbitrary elements).

### Renderless sash? No — single-node sash with CSS

The sash is rendered by `TugSplitPane`, not the consumer. Consumers customize via the `sash` prop, which flows into CSS variables on the group. This keeps the API small: one prop tree, one set of tokens, no need to drill `sash={…}` into every panel.

---

## CSS structure

- `@tug-pairings` block (compact + expanded)
- Body-scoped aliases: `--tugx-split-pane-*` resolving to `--tug7-*` in one hop
- `.tug-split-pane` — root flex container; flex-direction driven by `data-orientation`
- `.tug-split-pane-horizontal` / `.tug-split-pane-vertical` — orientation modifiers
- `.tug-split-panel` — each pane; `flex: <size>` driven by inline style from the library
- `.tug-split-panel[data-collapsed="true"]` — collapsed state
- `.tug-split-sash` — draggable divider; cross-axis size = thickness, main-axis size = 100%
- `.tug-split-sash-grip` — optional centered icon
- `.tug-split-sash[data-state="hover"]`, `[data-state="active"]`, `[data-focus-visible]` — states (library provides data attrs where possible)
- Size variants: `.tug-split-pane-sm`, `.tug-split-pane-md`, `.tug-split-pane-lg`

---

## Token design

Seven-slot `--tug7-split-*` tokens following the token naming convention. Initial set:

| Token                                    | Purpose |
|------------------------------------------|---------|
| `--tug7-split-sash-bg-normal-rest`       | sash fill, resting |
| `--tug7-split-sash-bg-normal-hover`      | sash fill, hover |
| `--tug7-split-sash-bg-normal-active`     | sash fill, dragging |
| `--tug7-split-sash-fg-normal-rest`       | grip icon color, resting |
| `--tug7-split-sash-fg-normal-hover`      | grip icon color, hover |
| `--tug7-split-sash-ring-focus`           | keyboard focus ring |
| `--tug7-split-sash-thickness-sm/md/lg`   | visible sash thickness per size |
| `--tug7-split-sash-hit-area-sm/md/lg`    | interactive hit area per size |
| `--tug7-split-sash-grip-size-sm/md/lg`   | grip icon size per size |
| `--tug7-split-pane-gap`                  | optional gap inside the hit area for a "snap gap" look |

Pair with both `brio.css` and `harmony.css`. Document the pairings in the module docstring and CSS header.

Per [L20] token sovereignty, `tug-split-pane` does not restyle its children. Panes are opaque regions — whatever lives inside (typically a TugBox) owns its own tokens.

---

## Gallery card

`cards/gallery-split-pane.tsx` is an interactive demo showing:

- Horizontal split (the Tide use case): markdown above, prompt below
- Vertical split: a 2-pane side-by-side layout
- 3-pane split with a collapsible center pane (click a button to collapse/expand)
- Nested split: vertical outer with a horizontal inner pane on the right
- Sash variants: thin + no icon, thick + grip icon, color overrides via inline tokens
- Size variants: sm / md / lg
- Snap-to-close demo: drag the prompt pane below its minimum, watch it collapse; drag back to reopen
- Persistent layout demo: reload the page, layout is restored
- Disabled pane (non-resizable sash)
- Live readout of current layout ratio (demonstrates `onSizeCommit` callback)

Each sub-demo has a short caption explaining what it shows. The gallery is the reference the Tide card integration will look at when mounting T3.4 content.

---

## Implementation plan

We are deliberately *not* using the `tugplug:plan` workflow for this component. That workflow has been producing too much boilerplate, too much ceremony, and too little introspection on the work in between — which is exactly wrong for a user interface component where every step should be something you can look at and touch.

Instead: small visible chunks under HMR. After each chunk we stop, look at it in the browser, discuss what's off, and move on. No sub-agents, no committer-agent, no big nugget of work at the end. The user commits when satisfied with a chunk (or a cluster of chunks).

**The discipline:** never write a chunk that can't be verified until the next chunk lands. If a step produces nothing visible, it is too big or it is in the wrong order.

### Steps

1. **Dependency + smoke test.** `bun add react-resizable-panels`, verify MIT license in the resolved package, verify the React 19.2 peer range, mount a raw `PanelGroup` in a throwaway gallery card to prove it renders at all.
2. **Minimal `TugSplitPane` + `TugSplitPanel`.** Unstyled, horizontal only, two-pane only, no sash chrome beyond a 1px line. Works in HMR.
3. **Gallery card scaffold** with a horizontal 2-pane demo (two TugBoxes labelled "top" and "bottom"). This becomes the visual harness we iterate against for the rest of the steps.
4. **Tokens + pairings** in `brio.css` and `harmony.css`. Sash uses tokens for thickness and color. Theme switching should update it live.
5. **Sash states** — rest / hover / active / focus-visible — driven by CSS and data attributes.
6. **Grip icon + hit area.** Optional Lucide grip icon, hit area wider than visible thickness.
7. **Vertical orientation.** Add the `orientation` prop and demo variant.
8. **Size constraints** (`minSize`, `maxSize`), enforced on drag and on container resize.
9. **Snap-to-close.** `collapsible`, `collapsedSize`, `snapThreshold`, `onCollapsedChange`. Demo: drag below min, watch collapse, drag back, watch reopen.
10. **Persistence.** `storageKey`. Reload the page, layout restored.
11. **Size variants** (sm / md / lg) and the 3-pane + nested gallery demos.
12. **Keyboard + ARIA verification.** Tab, arrow keys, Home/End, Enter to toggle collapsible panels.
13. **Imperative ref API** — `collapsePanel`, `expandPanel`, `getLayout`, `setLayout`.
14. **Audit pass.** `bun run audit:tokens lint`, component authoring checklist, `bun run build`, `bun run test`.
15. **Link from tide.md T3.4** as a prerequisite.

Steps 1–3 are the first useful pause. After step 3 you can resize two panes on screen; everything after that is refinement.

Once `tug-split-pane` is in place, T3.4 picks up cleanly: the Tide card's content area becomes a `<TugSplitPane orientation="horizontal">` with `tug-markdown-view` on top and `tug-prompt-entry` on the bottom, and the rest of T3.4 is about the prompt-entry composition itself.

## Prep findings

Pass completed before step 1. Reads: `tuglaws/component-authoring.md`, `tug-slider.tsx` + `tug-slider.css`, `tug-accordion.tsx` (section headers), `gallery-registrations.tsx`, `gallery-slider.tsx`, `styles/themes/brio.css` (header + slider tokens), live fetch of `react-resizable-panels@4.10.0` manifest from the npm registry.

### 1. `react-resizable-panels` is green for our use

- **Latest version:** `4.10.0`
- **License:** MIT ✓
- **Author:** Brian Vaughn (@bvaughn), same maintainer over 160+ releases
- **Peer deps:** `"react": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"`, `"react-dom": "^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0"` — React 19 explicitly supported
- **Actively tested against React 19:** the library's own `devDependencies` pin `react@^19.2.3`, i.e. the same minor we're on (`^19.2.4`)
- **Not currently installed** in `tugdeck/node_modules`

No blockers. Step 1's `bun add react-resizable-panels` should land cleanly.

### 2. File layout (no surprises)

`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/` is the public API. Top-level = what app code imports. `internal/` = building blocks. `tug-split-pane` is public, top-level — two files only:

```
tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-split-pane.tsx
tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-split-pane.css
```

Both `TugSplitPane` and `TugSplitPanel` live in the same `.tsx` file, banner-delimited, per the compound component convention (same as `tug-accordion.tsx` with its `TugAccordion` + `TugAccordionItem`).

Gallery demo lives in `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/gallery-split-pane.tsx`. No barrel exports anywhere.

### 3. TSX structure to follow (verbatim from authoring guide)

1. Module docstring (name + purpose, then details, then law citations — no plan/spec references)
2. CSS import (`import "./tug-split-pane.css";`) — first, before React
3. Library imports (React, `react-resizable-panels`)
4. Internal imports (`cn`, `useTugBoxDisabled` if we cascade disabled, `TugIconName` if we type the grip icon)
5. Types
6. Exported props interfaces
7. `TugSplitPane` (forwardRef with named function for DevTools)
8. Banner: `/* --- TugSplitPanel --- */`
9. `TugSplitPanel` (forwardRef with named function)

Required boilerplate on the root of every forwarded component:
- `data-slot="tug-split-pane"` / `data-slot="tug-split-panel"` / `data-slot="tug-split-sash"`
- `className` via `cn("tug-split-pane", ...variantClasses, className)`
- `...rest` spread last
- Inline `style` merged, not replaced (`style={{ ...internal, ...style }}`)

### 4. Required law citations in the module docstring

Minimum set we must cite:
- **[L06]** appearance via CSS, never React state
- **[L15]** token-driven states (sash rest/hover/active/focus)
- **[L16]** every foreground rule declares its rendering surface
- **[L19]** component authoring guide
- **[L20]** token sovereignty — composed children (pane contents) keep their own tokens

Plus a scoped comment on why **we do not cite [L11]**: see §6 below — split-pane resize is not a chain-dispatched action, it is a state-mirror callback pattern, which the authoring guide explicitly permits.

### 5. CSS file structure to follow

```
/* @tug-pairings { ... } */          ← compact block (machine-parsed by audit-tokens lint)
/**
 * @tug-pairings                      ← expanded table (human/agent readable)
 * | Element | Surface | Role | Context |
 * ...
 */
body {                                ← optional component-tier aliases, one hop only [L17]
  --tugx-split-sash-bg: var(--tug7-surface-split-primary-normal-sash-rest);
  ...
}
.tug-split-pane { ... }                ← root
.tug-split-pane-horizontal { ... }     ← orientation variants
.tug-split-pane-vertical { ... }
.tug-split-panel { ... }
.tug-split-panel[data-collapsed="true"] { ... }
.tug-split-sash { ... }                ← sash base
.tug-split-sash-grip { ... }           ← grip icon
.tug-split-sash:hover { ... }          ← rest → hover → active → focus → disabled, in that order
.tug-split-sash[data-resize-handle-active] { ... }
.tug-split-sash:focus-visible { ... }
.tug-split-pane-sm { ... }             ← size variants
.tug-split-pane-md { ... }
.tug-split-pane-lg { ... }
```

Every rule that sets `color`, `fill`, `stroke`, or `border-color` without also setting `background-color` must have a `/* @tug-renders-on: <surface-token> */` annotation above it. This is non-negotiable — `audit-tokens lint` will fail the build otherwise.

Use component-tier `--tugx-split-*` aliases because the component has enough tokens to benefit. Resolve in one hop to `--tug7-*` per [L17].

### 6. [L11] and the state-mirror callback question

This is the one real design subtlety in the guide we need to resolve before writing any code.

**The rule:** controls that own user interactions emit actions through the chain (`useControlDispatch`), and callback props for user interactions are explicitly prohibited. A `TugCloseButton` must not expose `onClose`. `TugSlider` dispatches `SET_VALUE` via the chain.

**Why split-pane is different:** the authoring guide carves out an explicit exception for *state mirror callbacks*:

> Callback props for user interactions are prohibited. […] Non-user-interaction callbacks (state mirror callbacks like `onOpenChange` for Radix integration, lifecycle observers) are fine.

A split pane's layout state lives *inside the split pane* (specifically, inside `react-resizable-panels`' own state + optional `localStorage`). There is no external responder that owns layout. A consumer who wants to react to layout changes (e.g. "the inspector pane just collapsed — hide its toolbar") is asking for a state mirror, not dispatching a user action to some other component's responder.

**Decision:** `onSizeCommit` and `onCollapsedChange` are state mirror callbacks, not user-action callbacks. They do not need to go through the chain. `TugSplitPane` is a **layout primitive**, not a control in the [L11] sense. We cite [L06, L15, L16, L19, L20] in the module docstring and **do not cite [L11]**, with a short comment explaining why so a future auditor doesn't assume it was an oversight.

If we later decide we want chain-dispatched split-pane actions (e.g. `SPLIT_COLLAPSE_PANE` so a menu item can collapse the inspector), we add that on top — a menu item dispatches through the chain normally, the split pane registers via `useOptionalResponder` for those specific actions, and the state-mirror callbacks keep doing what they do.

### 7. Token naming — component slot is `split`

Seven-slot: `--tug7-<plane>-<component>-<constituent>-<emphasis>-<role>-<state>`

Component slot value: **`split`** (singular, no hyphen — matches `slider`, `toggle`, `field`, etc.).

Initial token sketch, refined from the roadmap spec using the seven-slot shape correctly:

| Token                                                  | Plane   | Purpose |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|
| `--tug7-surface-split-primary-normal-sash-rest`        | surface | sash fill, resting |
| `--tug7-surface-split-primary-normal-sash-hover`       | surface | sash fill, hover |
| `--tug7-surface-split-primary-normal-sash-active`      | surface | sash fill, dragging |
| `--tug7-element-split-icon-normal-grip-rest`           | element | grip icon color, resting |
| `--tug7-element-split-icon-normal-grip-hover`          | element | grip icon color, hover |
| `--tug7-element-split-border-normal-focus-rest`        | element | keyboard focus ring |

Non-contrast effect-like values (thickness, hit area size, grip icon size) are *not* pairings. Use plain CSS custom props outside the seven-slot convention, defined locally in the component CSS (e.g. `--tugx-split-sash-thickness-md: 6px;`) and scaled by size variants. This mirrors how tug-slider handles track height and thumb size — those are local values in `tug-slider.css`, not theme tokens.

Tokens must be added to **both** `tugdeck/styles/themes/brio.css` (dark) and `tugdeck/styles/themes/harmony.css` (light) with the same names. Theme files use a `--tug-color(palette, i: N, t: M)` palette-addressing syntax for values — reference pattern is `--tug7-surface-slider-primary-normal-track-rest` at brio.css:213. No generation script — hand-authored.

### 8. Gallery registration mechanics

Two files to touch when adding `gallery-split-pane`:

1. **`gallery-split-pane.tsx`** (new) — the demo card component. Follow `gallery-slider.tsx` pattern: module docstring, imports, component function, `cg-content` root className, `cg-section` blocks with `cg-section-title` labels, `TugSeparator` between sections. No `ResponderScope` needed unless we add chain-dispatched actions (we're not, per §6).

2. **`cards/gallery-registrations.tsx`** — two edits:
   - Import `GallerySplitPane` at the top with the other gallery imports
   - Add a tab template entry in `GALLERY_DEFAULT_TABS` under the "Layout & Structure" section (alongside `gallery-box`, `gallery-accordion`, `gallery-separator`)
   - Add a `registerCard({...})` call inside `registerGalleryCards()` with this exact shape (from `gallery-slider` at line 433-440):
     ```ts
     registerCard({
       componentId: "gallery-split-pane",
       contentFactory: (_cardId) => <GallerySplitPane />,
       defaultMeta: { title: "TugSplitPane", icon: "<lucide icon name>", closable: true },
       family: "developer",
       acceptsFamilies: ["developer"],
       sizePolicy: GALLERY_COMPLEX_SIZE,  // we want room for nested-split demos
     });
     ```
   - A good lucide icon candidate: `PanelLeftRight` or `Columns2` or `Rows2`. We'll pick during step 3.

### 9. TugBox disabled cascade

`tug-slider.tsx` uses `useTugBoxDisabled()` from `./internal/tug-box-context` to inherit the disabled cascade from a parent `TugBox`. Our split pane should do the same: when placed inside a disabled `TugBox`, all sashes become non-interactive. This is a one-line addition (`const boxDisabled = useTugBoxDisabled(); const effectiveDisabled = disabled || boxDisabled;`), applied to the panel group's disabled state. Worth remembering so I don't miss it in step 2.

### 10. Things the roadmap doc under-specified that I now have answers for

- **`data-orientation` attribute** on the root — the `@selector` annotation in the props doc lists class names, but the guide's convention is that a data attribute is equally acceptable. I'll use class names (`.tug-split-pane-horizontal`, `-vertical`) for consistency with `tug-slider-inline`/`-stacked`.
- **`data-slot` attributes**: root = `tug-split-pane`, panel = `tug-split-panel`, sash = `tug-split-sash`.
- **`data-collapsed="true"` on collapsed panels** drives CSS-only collapse visual. React state tracks the collapsed boolean (it's data — consumer code cares) but the visual change is pure CSS per [L06].
- **Sash focusability**: the sash *is* keyboard-focusable (we want arrow-key resize), so unlike `tug-slider` we do *not* set `data-tug-focus="refuse"` on it. `react-resizable-panels`' `PanelResizeHandle` is focusable by default.
- **State selectors for the sash**: `react-resizable-panels` emits `data-resize-handle-active` during drag. We use that for the active-state CSS rather than `:active` (which wouldn't survive pointer-capture scenarios).
- **Transition policy**: no transitions on size during drag (they'd fight the library's real-time updates). Transitions only on hover/focus state changes of the sash.

### 11. Confirmed step order is still correct

Nothing in the prep pass invalidates the step breakdown. One small amendment: **step 2 should also wire the TugBox disabled cascade** so we don't have to circle back later. That's a 3-line addition, belongs in step 2, not a new step.

### 12. Open question to raise with the user before step 1

**Imperative ref API scope.** The roadmap doc includes `collapsePanel`, `expandPanel`, `getLayout`, `setLayout` as step 13. `react-resizable-panels` exposes these directly on its `PanelGroup` and `Panel` refs — we'd just forward them. But: we don't yet have a concrete consumer (Tide card only uses the uncontrolled API). YAGNI says punt until we have a caller. Counterargument: the forwarding is ~10 lines and having it there when T3.4 or T3.5 reaches for it is nicer than retrofitting.

My vote: **keep step 13, but move it after step 14 (audit pass)**, so it's an optional polish rather than a blocker for "this component is shippable." If we ship without it and nobody misses it, delete step 13.

---

**Assessment:** Ready for step 1. One open question (§12) for the user to weigh in on. Everything else is decided, written down, and unblocked.
