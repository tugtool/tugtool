## Jul29B Perf — Idle Silence, Recalc Zero, the Typing Gate, and the Other 15 Cores {#jul29b-perf}

**Purpose:** Attribute every remaining renderer cost named in `roadmap/jul29B-perf-brief.md` and eliminate or gate it: idle rendering updates to zero, style recalculations to zero at idle, typing latency under a committed budget test, and the committed multicore work (brief items M1/M2/M3) landed — with the M4 out-of-process-iframe spike verdict delivered before anything else.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

The jul29 perf program (`roadmap/archive/jul29-perf-tuneup.md`) cut release idle renderer busy from 13.8% to 8.3% by shrinking composited breadth: 438 pulsing-dot stacking contexts to 0, retained finished transitions to 0. What remains is measured but unattributed, and `roadmap/jul29B-perf-brief.md` charges this phase with four things: name what *schedules* the ~8% of idle rendering updates (86% of remaining busy is `Page::updateRendering` on a deck that should be asleep), make style recalculation an attributed and gated quantity (~23 `Style::TreeResolver::resolve` samples per 5s idle window, initiator unknown), turn "typing won't lag" into an enforced number (typing busy measured 65.9% with the dominant term — the after-layout compositing walk at 241+61 samples — surviving both A/B suspects), and use the machine's other cores where that is honestly possible (brief `#multicore`, calls made 2026-07-29: M1/M2/M3 IN, M4 spike-first, M5 OUT).

The controlling model, from the brief's `#mechanism`: **renderer busy = wakes per second × cost per wake**. The prior phase attacked cost-per-wake; this phase attacks the wake side at idle, the walked-tree size under typing, and adds the gates that keep both down.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- The M4 spike runs first and alone ([P01]); its verdict completes the committed work list before any other step starts.
- Instruments before verdicts, verdicts before fixes, fixes before gates, release re-profile last ([P02]). No fix ships before its cost is attributed, and no attribution counts until it predicts the profile numerically.
- All new instruments live in `tugdeck/src/lib/perf-monitor.ts` beside `animationCensus`/`layerTreeProbe`, dev/test-gated and windowed so the monitor never violates the budgets it guards ([P03]).
- Idle fixes follow one doctrine: a write that changes nothing is a defect; a timer that can sleep must sleep; a waker that legitimately survives is named with its measured cost ([P04]).
- The typing charge is pursued on two fronts: attribute the after-layout walk (the RenderLayer-breadth hypothesis, brief `#typing-hypothesis`), and land a keystroke-latency gate that fails CI regardless of which mechanism regresses ([P08]).
- Multicore work is scoped to what the code actually is: the sparkline is SVG today, so brief item M2 is a *conversion* to worker-drawn `OffscreenCanvas` ([P05]); Tug.app is single-window today, so brief item M3 is the process-isolation groundwork verified by process count ([P06]); brief item M1 lands one worker offload against the top hotspot the attribution session names ([Q04]).

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- The M4 spike has a written yes/no verdict in `roadmap/jul29B-perf-brief.md#record` backed by a WebContent process count and a cross-stall observation (Step 1 checkpoint).
- Idle attribution closes arithmetically: measured wakes/s × measured per-wake cost predicts the `sample` busy total within ±25%, with every waker named (Step 3 checkpoint).
- A settled heavy deck reads **0 DOM writes/s** on the mutation census, enforced by a committed app-test (Step 5).
- Release idle busy ≤ **1.5%** on `scripts/perf-resize-profile.sh dev.tugtool.app idle 5`, three consecutive samples (Step 12; brief target ≤1%, tolerance for gauge readouts justified in the record if used).
- Typing keystroke→paint latency on the heavy fixture deck: **p50 < 9ms, p95 < 17ms**, enforced by a committed app-test (Step 11).
- The after-layout compositing walk under typing is attributed with a measured experiment (containment A/B), verdict recorded (Step 8).
- Brief items M1, M2, M3 landed; M5 untouched.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. The M4 out-of-process-iframe spike and its verdict.
2. Three new instruments in `perf-monitor.ts`: waker census, mutation census, RenderLayer-candidate probe.
3. The idle attribution session and the fixes it convicts (pulse readout change-gating first).
4. The idle-silence gate and the typing-latency gate as app-tests.
5. Typing attribution: layer ground truth + containment experiment, and productization if convicted.
6. Multicore: sparkline worker conversion (M2), per-window process pool (M3), one data-plane worker offload (M1).
7. Release re-profile and brief record updates.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Brief item M5 (separate WKWebView per heavy surface) — OUT by user call until further notice.
- `tuglaws/motion-residency.md` authorship — tracked in `roadmap/archive/animation-tuneup.md` step-19; the census remains the contract.
- The other five progress-indicator variants' settled-state costs ([Q06] of the archived animation-tuneup brief) — separate follow-on.
- Any windowing/virtualization of the transcript; estimated cell heights remain banned.
- Speculative worker offloads beyond the one Step 3 names ([P07] discipline: no threading without a named hotspot).

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- A debug build with the app-test harness (`just app-debug`, `just app-test <files…>`) and a user-built release bundle for re-profiles (`just app-release`, `just launch-release`).
- `scripts/perf-resize-profile.sh` (exists; note its `applyKeyframeEffects` verdict-line false positive on finite transitions, brief `#method`).
- The corpus fixture `session-transcript-basic` (reference-seeded; session content never enters the repo) for heavy-deck tests, as used by `tests/app-test/at0289-transcript-motion-hygiene.test.ts`.
- Safari with the Develop menu for Web Inspector attribution sessions (the WKWebView is already inspectable: `tugapp/Sources/MainWindow.swift` sets `webView.isInspectable = true` unconditionally on macOS 13.3+).

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- bun, never npm; `bunx vite build` must pass before any tugdeck step is declared done (debug app loads the production rollup bundle).
- Rust warnings are errors; Swift changes must build via `just app-debug` / `just app-release`.
- App-tests: selective runs only (`just app-test-changed`, explicit files); every new test carries `@covers`; `just app-test-covers-check` enforces declarations and per-source fan-out budgets (`ACCEPTED_FANOUT` may need a new entry for `perf-monitor.ts`, which at0288/at0289 already cover).
- The perf monitor and all new instruments run only under `import.meta.env.DEV || window.__tugTestMode` (the existing gate in `tugdeck/src/main.tsx`); production carries zero instrument wakeups.
- Persistent state through tugbank `/api/defaults/...` only; no localStorage/IndexedDB anywhere in this plan.
- Only the user commits on `main`; the implement skill commits on a dash worktree via `tugutil dash commit` when run as a dash.
- **No private SPI, anywhere, for any reason** (call of 2026-07-29, from the M4 spike). Underscore-prefixed WebKit/AppKit selectors and `_WKFeature` toggles are off-limits even behind an env gate with a fallback — Apple can rename or remove them in any OS update and the failure is silent. Everything this plan lands is public API: Workers, `OffscreenCanvas`, `WKProcessPool`, CSS containment.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The heavy-deck profiles in the brief (8.3% idle, 65.9% typing) remain reproducible on the same machine; if the user's live deck changed materially, Step 3 re-baselines before attributing.
- `Date.now()` clocking in instruments is acceptable (they are dev/test-only measurement code, not product state).
- WebKit's `MutationObserver` sees `textContent` replacement as a `childList` mutation (it does — the old text node is removed, a new one added), so the mutation census catches the pulse readout's write pattern.

### Reference and Anchor Conventions (MANDATORY) {#reference-conventions}

This plan follows the devise-skeleton conventions: explicit `{#anchor}` on every heading cited later, `[P##]` for plan-local decisions, `[Q##]` open questions, `S##` specs, `T##` tables, `R##` risks, `**Depends on:**` lines with `#step-N` anchors, and `**References:**` lines citing labels and anchors, never line numbers. Brief items M1–M5 are *brief-local* labels from `roadmap/jul29B-perf-brief.md#multicore-options`; this plan cites them as "brief M1" etc. to keep them distinct from any plan milestone.

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Does WKWebView give a cross-origin iframe its own WebContent process on this macOS? (RESOLVED — yes on the engine, OUT on policy) {#q01-site-isolation}

**Question:** With a stock `WKWebViewConfiguration` (no experimental-feature toggles — we ship stock), does navigating an iframe to a different origin create a second WebContent process, and does main-thread load in one fail to stall the other?

**Why it matters:** This is the only honest path to "a session card on its own thread" (brief M4). If yes, per-card isolation becomes a real design option and graduates to IN with its own design pass; if no, the typing charge leans entirely on breadth/containment levers and the question closes permanently.

**Options (if known):** Origin trick — the deck is served at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (tugcast; vite in dev — see `AppDelegate.swift` `loadURL` call sites), and `http://localhost:<port>` is the *same server on a different origin*, so the spike needs no second server.

**Plan to resolve:** Step 1 spike, before all other work.

**Resolution:** **Yes on the engine; OUT on policy.** (2026-07-29, macOS 15.6 / WebKit 18.6.) Stock config gives no isolation. WebKit's `SiteIsolationEnabled` feature — default off, status *unstable*, reachable only through the `_WKFeature` private SPI — does deliver it: a cross-origin iframe gets its own WebContent process and a 200ms-per-250ms spin inside it leaves the deck at 300 frames / 5s, p95 17ms, versus 108 frames and p95 211ms with the flag off. **Tug does not ship private SPI**, so brief M4 is closed regardless of the capability. All spike scaffolding was removed; `MainWindow.swift` is byte-identical to `main`. Reopens only if the feature graduates to stable status with public, non-underscored API. Evidence and the full call in brief `#record-m4`.

#### [Q02] Can off-viewport transcript entries carry `content-visibility: auto` without breaking transcript features? (OPEN) {#q02-containment-features}

**Question:** Does skipping rendering for off-screen transcript entries break find-in-transcript (which measures/reveals matches), the share gesture, reveal-scrolling under the sticky header (`reference: sticky-header reveal gotcha`), or CSS Custom Highlight painting?

**Why it matters:** If the containment experiment (Step 8) convicts tree breadth, `content-visibility` is the productization lever — but only if the features survive. The no-height-estimates doctrine also constrains the mechanism ([P09]).

**Plan to resolve:** Step 8 measures the perf effect with a style-injection experiment; Step 9 (conditional) does the feature-correctness pass before any productization.

**Resolution:** MOOT. #step-8 refuted the hypothesis containment was the productization of — 35× the stacking contexts costs 2ms per keystroke and stretches no frame — so the feature-compatibility question never has to be answered. Recorded as refuted rather than deferred (brief `#record-typing`).

#### [Q03] After change-gating, how much legitimate churn remains in the pulse gauge readouts? (OPEN) {#q03-gauge-churn}

**Question:** Once the readout paint writes only on actual formatted-string change, do live cpu/memory gauges still flip digits often enough at idle to keep waking the page?

**Why it matters:** [P04] allows named, justified live readouts — but if the last digit strobes at 4Hz, the fix is display quantization or a slower gauge cadence, which is a product-feel decision.

**Plan to resolve:** Step 4 measures the residual with the mutation census after change-gating lands; if residual writes exceed ~1/s per visible card, quantize the formatted precision (e.g. whole-percent cpu) in the same step and note it in the brief record.

**Resolution:** Pre-fix input measured (brief `#record-idle`): six mounted rows write **48/s** — every row writes `textContent` AND `dataset.idle` on every one of its four ticks a second, with nothing changing. The eased value settles to a fixed formatted string within a second of the session going quiet, so change-gating should take the residual to zero rather than to "less"; the post-fix residual is measured in #step-4 and decides whether quantization is needed at all.

#### [Q04] Which data-plane hotspot does the brief-M1 worker offload target? (OPEN) {#q04-m1-target}

**Question:** Which JS hotspot on the restore/ingestion path is worth the first worker: markdown parsing (`tugdeck/src/lib/markdown/parse-cache.ts` `ensureParsed`, already counted by `lib/markdown/parse-counters.ts`), transcript find indexing (`tugdeck/src/lib/transcript-find-engine.ts`), or diff computation (`components/tugways/body-kinds/diff-block.tsx`)?

**Why it matters:** [P07]: no speculative threading. Today's profiles show style/layout/compositing dominating, not JS — the offload must chase a *named* JS hotspot or it is busywork.

**Plan to resolve:** Step 3's attribution session profiles a cold restore of the heavy fixture (Web Inspector JavaScript & Events timeline) and names the top JS self-time entry; Step 10 implements that one.

**Resolution:** **NO TARGET** (brief `#record-m1`). Measured on a cold restore: the whole replay ingest is `dispatchMs` **2** across 148 frames, markdown parses **9** times with the cache and memoization already carrying the rest, and find indexing and diff computation do not run on the path at all. JS is the largest term of real work on the restore (351 leaf samples against layout's ~280), but the ingest split places it in React rendering — DOM-touching work no Worker can take. Under [P07] that means #step-10 does not run.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Site isolation unusable (R01) | med | **realized, by policy not engine** | Capability exists but only via private SPI, which Tug does not ship; plan proceeds on breadth levers as designed | The feature graduating to public API |
| Change-gating starves a live readout (R02) | med | low | Gate on formatted-output equality only, never on raw value deltas | Q03 residual measurement |
| Canvas sparkline visual regression (R03) | med | med | Parity checklist + user gallery eyeball; staircase geometry ported 1:1 | Step 6 checkpoint |
| Containment breaks find/reveal/share (R04) | high | med | Experiment is style-injection only; productization gated on feature pass (Q02) | Step 9 tests |
| Typing gate flaky on machine variance (R05) | med | med | p50/p95 over ≥60 keystrokes, budgets with headroom, one retry, assert after settle | First CI failures |

**Risk R01: M4 spike answers "no"** (did not materialize — see [Q01]) {#r01-site-isolation-dead}

- **Risk:** WKWebView hosts cross-origin iframes in-process on this macOS; per-card isolation is dead on our engine.
- **Mitigation:** That outcome is a *successful* spike — the verdict is recorded in the brief and the question never burns another hour; the typing work (Steps 8–9, 11) does not depend on it.
- **Residual risk:** None material; the plan's other levers are independent.

**Risk R03: sparkline conversion changes the pixels** {#r03-sparkline-pixels}

- **Risk:** The worker-drawn canvas tape differs visibly from the SVG tape (stroke rendering, device-pixel snapping, area fill alpha, theme tint).
- **Mitigation:** Port the exact staircase geometry (`redraw()`'s sample-and-hold point construction), draw at `devicePixelRatio`, resolve stroke/fill colors from the same CSS custom properties on the main thread and re-post on theme change; keep the WAAPI scroll on the same `.tug-sparkline-track` element so motion is untouched.
- **Residual risk:** Sub-pixel stroke differences only the user's eyes can judge — the Step 6 checkpoint includes that eyeball explicitly.

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] The M4 spike runs first, before any other step (DECIDED) {#p01-spike-first}

**Decision:** Step 1 is the out-of-process-iframe spike; no other step starts until its verdict is written.

**Rationale:**
- User call, 2026-07-29 (brief `#multicore-options`): the verdict completes the IN list before execution order is locked.
- If per-card isolation is alive, it changes how hard later steps lean on containment.

**Implications:** Step 1 has no dependencies; every other step transitively depends on it.

#### [P02] Attribution before fixes; arithmetic must close (DECIDED) {#p02-attribution-first}

**Decision:** No fix ships before its cost is attributed, and an attribution is accepted only when measured wakes × measured per-wake cost predicts the sampled busy total within ±25%.

**Rationale:**
- The prior phase's lesson (brief `#top`): fixes aimed at categories left an unexplained 8%.
- A closure criterion makes "attributed" falsifiable instead of rhetorical.

**Implications:** Step 3 (idle) and Step 8 (typing) are measurement steps with docs-only commits; they gate the fix steps behind them.

#### [P03] Instruments live in `perf-monitor.ts`, dev/test-gated, windowed (DECIDED) {#p03-instruments-windowed}

**Decision:** The waker census, mutation census, and RenderLayer-candidate probe are implemented in `tugdeck/src/lib/perf-monitor.ts`, exposed on `window.tugPerfMonitor` inside the existing `import.meta.env.DEV || window.__tugTestMode` gate in `tugdeck/src/main.tsx`, and every observation window is explicitly started and stopped — no standing observers, no standing counters that tick at idle.

**Rationale:**
- The monitor "must never violate the thing it guards" (module docstring); a standing `MutationObserver` would be its own waker.
- One home, one exposure point, one graduation path — the same as `animationCensus` (instrument → convict → fix → gate).

**Implications:** Production builds carry zero instrument code paths at runtime; app-tests and the DevPanel are the only consumers.

#### [P04] The idle contract: change-gated writes, dormancy-gated timers, named survivors (DECIDED) {#p04-idle-contract}

**Decision:** An idle deck schedules zero rendering updates. Concretely: no DOM write may occur when its output is unchanged (compare the formatted string, write only on difference); every periodic timer must be dormancy-gated or subscriber-gated; any waker judged legitimately alive at idle is named in the brief record with its measured cost.

**Rationale:**
- `el.textContent = same string` still replaces the text node and dirties style — the pulse readout defect (brief H1) is exactly this.
- Zero-at-idle is the only budget that composes: any nonzero allowance grows silently.

**Implications:** The Step 5 gate asserts mutation-census zero on a settled test deck; product code adopts write-on-change as a standing convention.

#### [P05] Brief M2 is a conversion: the sparkline tape becomes a worker-drawn OffscreenCanvas, keeping the tape architecture (DECIDED) {#p05-sparkline-worker}

**Decision:** `TugSparkline` (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-sparkline.tsx`) replaces its `<svg>`/`<polyline>`/`<polygon>` tape with a `<canvas>` whose rendering context is transferred to a shared render worker (`transferControlToOffscreen`); the tape data model, staircase geometry, epoch-rebased WAAPI `translateX` scroll on `.tug-sparkline-track`, dormancy protocol, `IntersectionObserver` visibility gate, and `data-activity-channel` tinting attribute all stay exactly as they are; sampling stays on the main thread (it reads main-thread stores) and per-sample work becomes one `postMessage`.

**Rationale:**
- The brief said "OffscreenCanvas sparklines" but the component is SVG today — the 4Hz live-mode cost is `setAttribute("points", …)` style invalidation on the main thread, and that is what the conversion removes (a worker's canvas commit composites without waking the page's main thread).
- The tape/dormancy design survived careful review and A/Bs; rewriting it would be waste and risk. Only the *painting* moves.
- The in-repo precedent is `tugdeck/src/lib/workers/image-downsample-worker.ts` (Worker + OffscreenCanvas, `OffscreenCanvas` only goes off-thread when owned by a Worker).

**Implications:** Colors must be resolved on the main thread (`getComputedStyle` of the container's stroke/fill custom properties) and posted at init and on theme/`data-activity-channel` change; the worker draws at `devicePixelRatio`; Spec S05 is the protocol; laws [L06]/[L13] retained (appearance via DOM/compositor, motion stays WAAPI).

#### [P06] Brief M3 is per-window process-pool groundwork, verified by process count (DECIDED) {#p06-process-pool}

**Decision:** `MainWindow` (`tugapp/Sources/MainWindow.swift`) gives its `WKWebViewConfiguration` an explicitly non-shared `WKProcessPool` owned by the window instance, so any future second deck window gets its own WebContent process by construction; the checkpoint verifies one WebContent process per window via `pgrep`.

**Rationale:**
- Tug.app is single-window today (one `MainWindow` construction in `AppDelegate.swift`); the user-visible payoff of M3 arrives with multi-window support, but the isolation property should be structural now so it cannot regress silently later.
- Cost is a few lines of Swift; no behavior change for one window.

**Implications:** Documented in the brief record as "groundwork landed, payoff at multi-window"; no UI work in this plan.

#### [P07] No speculative threading (DECIDED) {#p07-no-speculative-threading}

**Decision:** Worker offloads land only against a hotspot named by a profile (Step 3 for brief M1); brief M5 gets zero work.

**Rationale:** User call, and brief `#multicore-exit` [E4]: today's bills are wake-rate and breadth, not JS compute.

**Implications:** Step 10 implements exactly one offload; further candidates go to the roadmap section, not to code.

#### [P08] The typing gate: FRAME GAP, p50 < 20ms / p95 < 26ms over 240 keystrokes (AMENDED 2026-07-29) {#p08-typing-gate}

**Decision:** The gate drives 240 keystrokes into the session composer on the restored heavy fixture via `nativeType` while a `requestAnimationFrame` loop records inter-frame gaps, and asserts **frame gap p50 < 20ms and p95 < 26ms**. The keystroke→post-paint distribution is printed alongside but not asserted.

**Amended from:** keystroke→post-paint latency, p50 < 9ms / p95 < 17ms. That probe measures vsync phase. `requestAnimationFrame` fires at the next display refresh, so every sample carries a uniform 0–16.7ms wait that depends on where in the cycle the key landed and not on what the keystroke cost. Measured on a deck comfortably at frame rate (#step-8), it reads p50 11ms / p95 17ms — **p50 < 9ms is unreachable in principle at 60Hz**, so the original budget could never have been met by any implementation.

**Rationale:**
- "Won't lag" must be a number that fails CI (brief `#typing-gate`), and frame gap is that number without a floor artifact: a rendering update that fits the budget leaves the gap at the display period, one that overruns stretches a frame, and there is nowhere else for the cost to hide.
- It also states the guarantee in the words the guarantee is about — typing must not drop a frame.
- 60Hz is 16.7ms; p50 at 20 allows measurement jitter but not a systematically late frame, p95 at 26 allows roughly one stretched frame in twenty.

**Implications:** Calibrated against the #step-8 reference readings (p50 17ms, p95 18–19ms, stable even with 4,000 extra stacking contexts injected) and frozen; loosening them requires a recorded decision, not a test edit in passing. Measured p50 17 / p95 18 on three consecutive runs.

#### [P09] Containment must honor the no-height-estimates doctrine (DECIDED) {#p09-containment-heights}

**Decision:** If containment productizes (Step 9), off-screen transcript entries use `content-visibility: auto` with `contain-intrinsic-size: auto <last>` semantics only — the engine's *remembered real size* — never a hand-authored estimated height; if remembered-size semantics prove unavailable or unstable in our WebKit, productization stops and the verdict is recorded instead.

**Rationale:**
- Estimated cell heights are banned in this codebase (windowing was pivoted out on exactly this); `contain-intrinsic-size: auto` keeps the doctrine because the placeholder is the element's own last-rendered measurement.

**Implications:** Step 9's tasks include verifying remembered-size behavior empirically before any CSS ships.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### The idle waker suspects, with code ground truth {#waker-suspects}

**Table T01: Periodic wakers in tugdeck as of 2026-07-29** {#t01-wakers}

| # | Source | Cadence | Gating today | Expected verdict path |
|---|--------|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Pulse readout paint — `components/tugways/cards/pulse-card.tsx`, `READOUT_PAINT_MS = 250`, `paint()` writes `el.textContent` + `el.dataset.idle` unconditionally per `ChannelRow` | 4Hz × rows | None (runs while card mounted) | Smoking gun (brief H1); fix = change-gate ([P04]), Step 4 |
| 2 | Sparkline sampler — `components/tugways/tug-sparkline.tsx`, `SAMPLE_MS = 250`, live mode writes SVG `points` attributes | 4Hz × live tapes | Rate rows dorm via `subscribeRateActivity`; **gauge rows never dorm** (`subscribeActivity` undefined by design) | Convict via census; fix = [P05] conversion (Step 6) removes the style dirt; gauge always-alive policy re-costed in Step 3 |
| 3 | Shared telemetry tick — `components/tugways/cards/session-card-telemetry-renderers.tsx`, module-scoped `setInterval(…, 1_000)` | 1Hz | Subscriber-gated (stops at zero subscribers) | Census says whether anything subscribes at idle |
| 4 | `useLifecycleTick` — `lib/code-session-store/hooks/use-lifecycle-tick.ts` | 1Hz | Turn-gated (`isLivePhase`), `alsoWhile` escape hatch | Expected innocent; check `alsoWhile` holders |
| 5 | Non-timer wakes: IntersectionObserver deliveries, WebSocket → store notify → commit, animation-event bookkeeping for running accelerated loops | — | — | Only reachable via Web Inspector timeline (Step 3) |

The perf monitor's own 1Hz heartbeat (`perf-monitor.ts`, `HEARTBEAT_MS`) fires in dev/test builds only — attribution sessions on the release bundle are unpolluted by it; census sessions on debug must subtract it.

#### Why `sample` cannot finish this job {#sample-limits}

`sample` sees stack frames, not causes: it shows `TreeResolver::resolve` but never the mutation that dirtied the tree, `updateRendering` but never who scheduled it. The two instruments that close the gap: Safari Web Inspector Timelines (initiator attribution per rendering frame — available because `MainWindow.swift` sets `isInspectable` unconditionally) and the in-page censuses (S01/S02), which make the same facts app-testable. `scripts/perf-resize-profile.sh` remains the end-to-end release thermometer, with its known false positive: nonzero `applyKeyframeEffects` reached through `updateCSSTransitionsForStyleableAndProperty` is a finite transition doing its job, not an unaccelerated loop (brief `#method`).

#### The after-layout walk under typing (brief H6) {#after-layout-walk}

Every keystroke makes CM6 lay out (necessary); layout triggers `updateCompositingLayersAfterLayoutIfNeeded`, whose `computeCompositingRequirements` recursion visits every RenderLayer — created by positioned elements, overflow scrollers, and transforms, a far larger population than the 119 stacking contexts `layerTreeProbe` counts. That would explain the prior A/B cleanly: forcing 28 sticky headers static removed 28 contexts from thousands of layers — invisible, exactly as observed (241+61 samples invariant across all three phases). The decisive tests: the Web Inspector Layers tab (real composited-layer list with reasons), the S03 candidate count (app-testable denominator), and the containment experiment (shrink the walked tree, re-measure).

---

### Specification {#specification}

**Spec S01: Waker census** {#s01-waker-census}

`startWakerCensus()` installs wrappers over `window.setInterval`, `window.setTimeout`, and `window.requestAnimationFrame` (idempotent; original functions retained and always called through). Each registration records a callsite key — the top non-perf-monitor frame of `new Error().stack` — plus kind and period. `readWakerCensus(windowMs)` returns, after observing for `windowMs`: `{ entries: [{ kind: "interval"|"timeout"|"raf", callsite: string, activeCount: number, firesPerSecond: number, periodMs: number|null }], totalFiresPerSecond: number }`, sorted by fires/s. `stopWakerCensus()` unwraps. Wrapping happens only when explicitly started (never at boot), so timers created before the census started are visible via their *fires* (the wrapper wraps the primitive, so pre-existing intervals registered before wrapping are the one blind spot — the census doc must state it, and the attribution session compensates by hard-reloading the deck with the census armed via a `sessionStorage`-free URL flag: `?wakerCensus=1` read in `main.tsx` inside the dev/test gate).

**Spec S02: Mutation census** {#s02-mutation-census}

`mutationCensus(windowMs)` returns a Promise: installs one `MutationObserver` on `document.documentElement` (`childList`, `attributes`, `characterData`, `subtree`, with old-value capture off), accumulates for `windowMs`, disconnects, resolves `{ windowMs, totalWrites, writesPerSecond, byTarget: [bucket, count][], byType: { childList, attributes, characterData } }` where `bucket` is `tag.class.class` (first two classes) of the mutation target's element (or its parent element for text nodes), sorted desc, capped at 20 buckets. Attribute mutations that set an identical value are still delivered by the platform and counted — that is correct for our purpose (the write itself is the defect).

**Spec S03: RenderLayer-candidate probe** {#s03-layer-candidates}

`layerTreeProbe()` (existing, `perf-monitor.ts`) gains: `renderLayerCandidates: number` and `renderLayerHistogram: [string, number][]` — elements whose computed style has `position !== "static"`, or `overflow`/`overflow-x`/`overflow-y` in `{auto, scroll, hidden}` (hidden included: WebKit creates layers for clipping contexts), or `transform !== "none"`, or non-auto `will-change`, bucketed like `stackingHistogram`. The existing `display: none` short-circuit applies. This is a *candidate* count (an upper-bound proxy for RenderLayer population), and the field docs must say so.

**Spec S04: Typing-latency probe and gate** {#s04-typing-probe}

Probe (installed by the gate test via `evalJS`): a capture-phase `keydown` listener on `document` records `performance.now()` into a pending slot; `requestAnimationFrame(() => setTimeout(() => record(now - pending), 0))` closes it (post-paint proxy). Collects `{ samples: number[], p50, p95, max }`; the test types ≥60 characters via `nativeType` with the composer focused on the restored `session-transcript-basic` fixture, waits for settle, asserts [P08] budgets, prints the distribution.

**Spec S05: Sparkline render-worker protocol** {#s05-sparkline-protocol}

One module-scoped shared worker instance (`tugdeck/src/lib/workers/sparkline-render-worker.ts`, plain dedicated Worker shared by all sparklines via an id-keyed registry — mirrors the downsample worker's build wiring). Messages, all `{ id }`-keyed per sparkline instance:

- `init { id, canvas: OffscreenCanvas (transferred), width, height, dpr, svgWidth, baselineY, amplitude, colors: { line, area } }`
- `tape { id, points: { t, v }[] , t0 }` — full rebuild (mount, wake, epoch rebase)
- `sample { id, t, v, t0 }` — append one point and redraw
- `colors { id, colors }` — theme or `data-activity-channel` change (main thread resolves computed colors)
- `clear { id }` / `dispose { id }`

The worker owns the tape array and the staircase geometry (ported verbatim from `redraw()`: flat hold to each new sample's x, step, held tail past the right edge, area polygon closed to `baselineY`); the main thread owns timers, dormancy, WAAPI scroll, visibility, and data reads. Nothing returns from the worker on the hot path.

#### State Zone Mapping (tugdeck/tugways plans) {#state-zone-mapping}

| State | Zone (appearance / local-data / structure) | Mechanism | Law |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|
| Waker/mutation census registries | none (dev/test instrument, module-scoped, windowed) | module singletons in `perf-monitor.ts`, read by probes | [P03]; explicitly not React state |
| Sparkline worker handle + per-instance id | local resource, not state | `useRef` inside `TugSparkline`'s existing `useLayoutEffect`; released in cleanup | [L03], [L27] |
| Pulse readout last-formatted string | local data (imperative write guard) | closure variable beside `paint()` in the existing effect | [L06] (appearance stays DOM-written) |
| Canvas pixel content | appearance | worker draws; compositor presents | [L06], [L13] (scroll stays WAAPI) |
| No new React state anywhere in this plan | — | — | [L24] table complete |

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

#### Test Categories {#test-categories}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **App-test (instrument self-test)** | Prove each census sees what it must (anti-vacuity floors) | at0291: a deliberately created interval is counted; a deliberate DOM write is counted; candidates > 0 on a seeded deck |
| **App-test (gate)** | Enforce the exit criteria permanently | at0292 idle silence, at0293 typing latency |
| **Unit (bun)** | Pure logic only | callsite bucketing, formatted-string gate predicate — real timers in bun runtime, no fake DOM |
| **Operator-assisted measurement** | Attribution sessions on the real deck | Steps 3 and 8; deliverable is the brief record, not a test |

#### What stays out of tests {#test-non-goals}

- Visual parity of the canvas sparkline — no pixel-diff harness; the user's gallery eyeball is the checkpoint (screenshots via `app.screenshot()` are available for the record but not asserted, per the highlight-wash gotcha).
- Web Inspector timeline contents — human instrument, not automatable.
- The M4 spike — it ends in a recorded verdict, not a committed test (the spike page itself is removed at close).
- Long real-scribe UI flows — out of scope per the transient-workspace constraint; nothing here needs them.

#### Step 1: M4 spike — out-of-process iframe verdict {#step-1} — DONE

**Commit:** `tugdash(jul29B-perf): out-of-process iframe spike — no site isolation on WebKit 18.6`

**References:** [P01] spike first, [Q01] site isolation, Risk R01, (brief `#record-m4`, brief `#multicore-options`)

**Outcome:** The capability exists behind WebKit's `SiteIsolationEnabled` feature (default off, status *unstable*, private `_WKFeature` SPI) and measurably works — with it on, a cross-origin iframe gets its own WebContent process and a 200ms-per-250ms spin inside it leaves the deck at 300 frames / 5s, p95 17ms, against 108 frames and p95 211ms with it off. **Closed OUT on policy: Tug does not ship private SPI.** All scaffolding removed in the same step; `MainWindow.swift` is byte-identical to `main`. Full A/B and the call in brief `#record-m4`.

**Method notes, if this is ever revisited (i.e. the feature graduates to public API):**
- Spike page: rAF fps counter plus a `?busy=1` mode spinning 200ms synchronously every 250ms; injected as a fixed-position iframe and measured against the deck's own rAF inter-frame gaps over 5s per stage.
- Cross origin without a second server: the deck is served at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`; `http://localhost:<port>` is the same server, different origin. Keep a **same-origin busy control** — it is what separates "isolated" from "the iframe just wasn't costly".
- **CSP first.** The deck is `default-src 'self'` with no `frame-src`, which blocks the iframe before any engine behavior is observable. The first run of this spike read as a hard "no isolation" purely because of that. Any probe must assert the iframe actually loaded.
- **Swift changes need `just build-app`.** `just app-test` refreshes the deck bundle and re-signs but does not recompile the app; the first flag-on run measured a binary without the hook and produced a convincing false negative, caught only because an expected log line was missing.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] Brief record carries the A/B, the policy call, and the reopen condition; working tree clean of spike artifacts.

---

#### Step 2: Instruments — waker census, mutation census, layer candidates {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugdash(jul29B-perf): waker + mutation censuses and layer-candidate probe, with self-test`

**References:** [P03] windowed instruments, Spec S01, Spec S02, Spec S03, (#sample-limits, #t01-wakers)

**Artifacts:**
- S01/S02/S03 implemented in `tugdeck/src/lib/perf-monitor.ts`; exposure added to `window.tugPerfMonitor` in `tugdeck/src/main.tsx` inside the existing dev/test gate, plus the `?wakerCensus=1` boot-arm flag (S01 blind-spot mitigation).
- `tests/app-test/at0291-perf-instruments.test.ts` with `@covers tugdeck/src/lib/perf-monitor.ts` (extend `ACCEPTED_FANOUT` if `just app-test-covers-check` objects — at0288/at0289 already cover this file).

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implement S01 with the documented pre-existing-timer blind spot noted in the fn docstring; wrappers must pass through return values and `clearInterval`/`cancelAnimationFrame` identity.
- [x] Implement S02 (Promise-based window; observer disconnected in a `finally`).
- [x] Implement S03 fields on `LayerTreeProbe`; document "candidate = upper-bound proxy".
- [x] at0291: (a) arm census, create a 50ms interval via `evalJS`, read ≥ its expected fires ±1 and its callsite bucket non-empty, clear it; (b) run `mutationCensus(1000)` across a deliberate `textContent` write and assert it is counted in `byTarget` under the right bucket, then across a quiet window on the same DOM and assert near-zero; (c) seed `gallery-tug-progress-indicator` (constants as in `at0288`) and assert `renderLayerCandidates > 0` and `> ` the empty-deck reading.

**Tests:**
- [x] `just app-test at0291-perf-instruments.test.ts` green.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `bunx tsc --noEmit` (tugdeck) clean; `bunx vite build` clean; `just app-test-covers-check` clean; at0291 green. `main.tsx` changed, so the core tier ran too (20/20, 39/39).

---

#### Step 3: Idle attribution session — arithmetic closure {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugdash(jul29B-perf): record idle attribution — every waker named, arithmetic closed`

**References:** [P02] attribution first, [Q03] gauge churn, [Q04] M1 target, Table T01, (#sample-limits, #waker-suspects, brief `#idle-arithmetic`)

**Artifacts:**
- Attribution tables in `roadmap/jul29B-perf-brief.md#record`: wakes/s by named source (waker census, `?wakerCensus=1` boot-armed), DOM writes/s by target (mutation census), Web Inspector Rendering Frames initiators for a 10s idle window, and the closure computation (wakes × per-wake cost vs `sample` busy, ±25%).
- The named brief-M1 hotspot ([Q04]): top JS self-time entry from a cold heavy-fixture restore, Web Inspector JavaScript & Events timeline.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Ran the three instruments and `scripts/perf-resize-profile.sh` against one parked deck in two arms (pulse detail closed / open). The app-test bundle has its own id, `dev.tugtool.app.apptest`, so the sampler finds its WebContent process cleanly with the user's own instances running — that is what made both sides of the arithmetic measurable on the same deck instead of across two.
- [x] Convicted/absolved every Table T01 row; no waker appeared outside the table.
- [x] Recorded the pre-fix readout write rate for [Q03].
- [ ] The [Q04] cold-restore JS profile — deferred with its reason; see the resolution under [Q04].

**Tests:**
- [x] None (docs-only step; [P02]).

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] The closure lands within ±25% from both arms independently (predicted 1.0% vs 1.1%; predicted 4.0% vs 3.7%), on a measured ~10ms per rendering update. Every T01 row carries a verdict. The one gap — this deck rests at 1.6% against the release baseline's 8.3% — is named in the record as a scope limit rather than papered over, and the clean release re-baseline is #step-12's.

---

#### Step 4: Kill the idle wakes — change-gate the pulse readout + convicted fixes {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `tugways(pulse): write readouts only on change; dormancy for convicted wakers`

**References:** [P04] idle contract, [Q03] gauge churn, Table T01, Risk R02, (#waker-suspects)

**Artifacts:**
- `pulse-card.tsx` `paint()` gated: compute the formatted string and idle flag, write `textContent`/`dataset.idle` only when either differs from the last written values (closure variables; see #state-zone-mapping).
- Fixes for any additional Step-3-convicted waker (each small; if one grows past a focused diff, split it into its own step at implement time and note it in the ledger).
- [Q03] resolution: post-fix residual writes/s measured; if > ~1/s per visible card, quantize the gauge display precision in the same commit and record the choice.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implemented the change gate on BOTH writes ([P04]: compare formatted output, never raw values — R02). `dataset.idle` was as unconditional as `textContent`.
- [x] Re-ran the census on a mounted, idle Pulse card; before/after in brief `#record-idle-fix` (64 → 15.2 writes/s, readout contribution zero, busy 5.5% → 3.9%).
- [x] The other convicted row (H2, the two never-dorming gauge tapes) is deliberately deferred to #step-6 rather than fixed twice — its `points` string genuinely changes every sample, so the gate has to be a canonicalized flat form authored against the drawing path that survives. Named in the record.

**Tests:**
- [x] `just app-test-changed` green.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `bunx tsc --noEmit` and `bunx vite build` clean; `just app-test-changed` green; brief record carries the before/after writes/s.

---

#### Step 5: Idle-silence gate — at0292 {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugdash(jul29B-perf): gate idle silence — zero DOM writes on a settled deck`

**References:** [P04] idle contract, Spec S02, (#success-criteria), brief `[E1]`

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/app-test/at0292-idle-silence.test.ts` (`@covers` the pulse card, `perf-monitor.ts`): seeds a deck with a Pulse card and a restored `session-transcript-basic` session card (cold restore, `waitForTranscriptSettled`), waits a settle window, then asserts `mutationCensus(3000)` reads `totalWrites === 0` and `readWakerCensus(3000)` shows no interval firing into a DOM-writing callsite bucket (assert on the census tables printed for diagnosis).

**Tasks:**
- [x] Anti-vacuity floor in place: a deliberate write must be counted before the quiet window is trusted, and the transcript's dot population is asserted so an empty restore cannot pass by having nothing to write.
- [x] 4s settle window clears the transient workspace's changeset churn before the 3s measured window opens.
- [x] The waker assertion is scoped to repeating INTERVALS — the perf monitor's own heartbeat is a dev/test-only `setTimeout` chain and would otherwise make the gate unsatisfiable on the build that can run it.

**Tests:**
- [x] `just app-test at0292-idle-silence.test.ts` green three consecutive runs.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] at0292 green ×3 (0 writes in 3,000ms every run); `just app-test-covers-check` clean.

---

#### Step 6: Sparkline → worker-drawn OffscreenCanvas (brief M2) {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugways(sparkline): paint the tape in a worker — OffscreenCanvas, geometry and dormancy unchanged`

**References:** [P05] conversion decision, Spec S05, Risk R03, (#state-zone-mapping), brief `#multicore-options` M2

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/workers/sparkline-render-worker.ts` (S05); `tug-sparkline.tsx` converted (SVG elements out, one `<canvas>` in the track; all lifecycle/dormancy/scroll logic untouched); `tug-sparkline.css` adjusted if the SVG selectors referenced element types.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Staircase ported verbatim into `lib/sparkline-geometry.ts`, drawn at `devicePixelRatio`, shared by the worker and the on-main fallback so there is one implementation.
- [x] Colors resolved on the main thread at mount, on theme change (`subscribeThemeChange`), and on `data-activity-channel` change; the Pulse card's per-consumer weights became `--tugx-sparkline-*` knobs with their defaults at point of use (R03).
- [x] Wired with the `image-downsample-worker.ts` pattern; vite emits `sparkline-render-worker-*.js` as its own chunk.
- [x] Instance registry keyed by id; `dispose` on cleanup ([L27]).
- [x] Fallback path present and sharing the same geometry module.
- [x] **Departure from S05, deliberate:** every draw carries the whole tape plus `t0` rather than appending one sample. The main thread owns both, and shipping them together makes a divergent picture impossible. Recorded in brief `#record-m2`.
- [x] **Departure from the plan's structure:** canvas ownership is its own effect keyed on geometry, because `transferControlToOffscreen` may be called once per element.

**Tests:**
- [x] `just app-test-changed` green.
- [x] at0292 still green — the conversion added no wakes.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `bunx tsc --noEmit` and `bunx vite build` clean (worker chunk emitted); `just app-test-changed` green; at0292 green. Measured 15.2 → **0 DOM writes/s** and 3.9% → **2.8%** busy with the pulse detail open.
- [ ] **User gallery eyeball** of the Pulse card live + dormant (R03 residual) — still owed. A screenshot confirms the tapes paint their staircase and area fill; stroke weight and fill alpha at real sizes are the user's call.

---

#### Step 7: Per-window process pool (brief M3) {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugapp: per-window WKProcessPool — process isolation groundwork for multi-window`

**References:** [P06] process pool, (#assumptions), brief `#multicore-options` M3

**Artifacts:**
- `MainWindow.swift`: the window's `WKWebViewConfiguration` gets an instance-owned `WKProcessPool` (`config.processPool = WKProcessPool()` beside the existing configuration setup).

**Tasks:**
- [x] Implemented above the DEBUG harness user-script block, so the injection path is untouched.
- [x] Verified: exactly one WebContent process carries the app's WebKit cache directory while a deck is parked.
- [x] Recorded in brief `#record-m3`, including that the payoff is deferred to multi-window.

**Tests:**
- [x] `just app-test-smoke` green (3/3).

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `just build-app` clean; smoke green; process count verified at 1.

---

#### Step 8: Typing attribution — layer ground truth + containment experiment {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-2, #step-5

**Commit:** `tugdash(jul29B-perf): record typing attribution — after-layout walk named, containment verdict`

**References:** [P02] attribution first, [Q02] containment features, Spec S03, Risk R04, (#after-layout-walk), brief `#typing-hypothesis`

**Artifacts:**
- Brief record: S03 candidate counts on the heavy deck (empty vs seeded, histogram), Web Inspector Layers-tab reading (real composited layers, reasons), and the containment A/B — typing profile (`sample` during a scripted 15s `nativeType` burst) with and without an injected style forcing `content-visibility: auto` on off-viewport transcript entries (`evalJS` style injection on the restored heavy fixture; identify the entry selector from `components/tugways/tug-transcript-entry.tsx` at implement time).
- H6 verdict: does shrinking the walked tree collapse the after-layout walk (241+61 baseline)?

**Tasks:**
- [x] Ran the containment A/B and found it cannot bite: the corpus's heaviest fixture renders **5** transcript entries, all in or near the viewport, so `content-visibility: auto` skips nothing. That is the first finding, not a failed attempt.
- [x] Tested the hypothesis by **dose-response instead** — inject overlapping, visible, `z-index`-stacked boxes and re-measure. 118 → 4,117 stacking contexts (2.5× the audited card) costs 2ms per keystroke, moves `computeCompositingRequirements` from 29 to 37 samples, and stretches no frame.
- [x] Named the next hypothesis: **composited layers (backing stores), not RenderLayers** — a Web Inspector Layers-tab reading on the user's own deck, since script cannot count them.
- [x] Marked #step-9 skipped in the ledger.

**Tests:**
- [x] None (docs-only; [P02]).

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] Both arms' numbers and a stated verdict are in brief `#record-typing`. [Q02] is moot — its feature probe was never needed because the hypothesis it served did not survive.

**Also found, and it changes #step-11:** the [P08] probe measures vsync phase. `requestAnimationFrame` fires at the next display refresh, so keystroke→post-paint carries a uniform 0–16.7ms wait unrelated to the keystroke's cost; on a deck comfortably at frame rate it reads p50 11ms / p95 17ms, which makes **p50 < 9ms unreachable in principle**. The gate must be rebuilt on inter-frame gap during a burst — no floor, and it states the real guarantee (typing must not drop a frame).

---

#### Step 9: Containment productization (conditional) — SKIPPED {#step-9}

**Not run.** #step-8 refuted [H6] by dose-response: 35× the stacking-context population, past 2.5× the audited card's, costs 2ms per keystroke and stretches no frame. Containment was the productization of that hypothesis; with the hypothesis dead there is nothing to productize, and shipping `content-visibility` against transcript features ([Q02], Risk R04) would have been risk bought for no measured return. The typing charge moves to the composited-layer hypothesis named in brief `#record-typing`. Everything below is left as authored, for the record of what was planned.

<details><summary>Original step, unrun</summary>


**Depends on:** #step-8

**Commit:** `tugways(transcript): content-visibility on off-viewport entries — walked tree, not estimates`

**References:** [P09] doctrine boundary, [Q02] containment features, Risk R04, (#after-layout-walk)

**Artifacts:**
- CSS (+ minimal component wiring if an attribute hook is needed) applying `content-visibility: auto` to transcript entries, honoring [P09]: `contain-intrinsic-size: auto`-remembered real sizes only — verify empirically that scroll position is stable across an entry leaving and re-entering the viewport before shipping; if remembered-size semantics are unstable in our WebKit, stop and record instead.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement; run the [Q02] feature matrix as tests where coverable: find-in-transcript reveal (respecting the sticky-header reveal constraint — reveals must clear the stuck header bottom), share gesture, scroll restoration on card switch.
- [ ] Re-run the Step 8 typing profile; record the landed after/before.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `just app-test-changed` green (transcript `@covers` fan-in).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bunx vite build` clean; feature matrix green; typing profile improvement recorded; user eyeball on transcript scrolling feel.

#### Step 10: Data-plane worker offload (brief M1) — NOT RUN {#step-10}

**Not run, under [P07].** [Q04] came back with no hotspot: replay ingest costs 2ms, markdown parses 9 times, and the other two candidates never execute on the restore path (brief `#record-m1`). An offload built against those numbers would have moved two milliseconds and added a permanent thread boundary. The restore *is* layout-bound — 125 leaf samples in flex layout alone — which is a real finding for a later phase and not a threading problem. Everything below is left as authored.

<details><summary>Original step, unrun</summary>


**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `tugdeck: move <named hotspot> off the main thread — worker offload per attribution`

**References:** [P07] no speculative threading, [Q04] M1 target, (#symbol-inventory), brief `#multicore-options` M1

**Artifacts:**
- One worker offload for the hotspot Step 3 named (candidates and their current homes: markdown `ensureParsed` in `lib/markdown/parse-cache.ts` with `recordRowParse` counters already in place; find indexing in `lib/transcript-find-engine.ts`; diff compute in `body-kinds/diff-block.tsx`). Wiring pattern: `image-downsample-worker.ts`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement against the named target only; preserve the synchronous fast path where results are cached (e.g. `parse-cache` hits must not gain a worker round-trip).
- [ ] Measure the restore-path improvement (repeat Step 3's cold-restore profile; record before/after top JS self-time).

**Tests:**
- [ ] `just app-test-changed` green; existing unit tests for the moved logic still green (`bun test` in tugdeck).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bunx vite build` clean (worker bundling verified — this is exactly the class of import that breaks the rollup build while dev works); before/after recorded.

#### Step 11: Typing-latency gate — at0293 {#step-11}

**Depends on:** #step-8, #step-9

**Commit:** `tugdash(jul29B-perf): gate typing latency — p50/p95 budgets on the heavy fixture`

**References:** [P08] typing gate, Spec S04, Risk R05, (#success-criteria), brief `[E3]`

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/app-test/at0293-typing-latency.test.ts`: frame-gap probe, 240 keystrokes via `nativeType` into the focused composer on the restored heavy fixture, budgets asserted, both distributions printed.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Rebuilt the gate on frame gap per the amended [P08] — the specced latency probe measures vsync phase and its budget was unreachable.
- [x] Calibrated against #step-8's reference readings and frozen; bursts spaced with settle delays per the first-responder harness constraint.
- [x] One retry on budget failure (R05), with both distributions printed when the retry differs.
- [x] Floors so it cannot pass vacuously: dot population, keystrokes actually delivered, composer text actually grown, frame loop actually sampled.

**Tests:**
- [x] `just app-test at0293-typing-latency.test.ts` green three consecutive runs — p50 17ms, p95 18ms, max 18–23ms.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] at0293 green ×3; `just app-test-covers-check` clean.

#### Step 12: Release re-profile, record, cleanup {#step-12}

**Depends on:** #step-5, #step-6, #step-7, #step-10, #step-11

**Commit:** `tugdash(jul29B-perf): release re-profile against exit criteria; spike page removed`

**References:** [P02] arithmetic closure, (#success-criteria, #exit-criteria), brief `#exit`

**Artifacts:**
- Brief `#record` closed: three idle samples on a fresh user-built release bundle (`just app-release`; verify the bundle's JS/CSS carry this plan's changes before sampling — the prior phase was once burned by profiling a stale bundle), typing-gate numbers, every exit line answered.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Owed to the user, not done here.** The release re-profile needs a genuinely idle release deck and a fresh release bundle. Building one from this worktree quits a running release instance, and the user is using theirs; sampling the live one mid-session reads 12.5% and is not an idle baseline. Run `scripts/perf-resize-profile.sh dev.tugtool.app idle 5` ×3 after landing, on a deck nobody is driving, and read the `applyKeyframeEffects` line through its known false positive.
- [x] All `zz-` probes removed. `tugdeck/public/spike.html` remains and is **not** this phase's — it is tracked on `main` from an older atoms-as-`img` spike (`3632c1bf6`), out of scope here.

**Tests:**
- [x] `just app-test at0291 at0292 at0293` green as a set.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `bunx tsc --noEmit` and `bunx vite build` clean; the three gates green together; brief `#record-close` states what landed and what is owed.

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** A release build whose idle renderer is silent and explained, whose style recalcs at idle are zero and gated, whose typing latency is under a committed budget test, and whose committed multicore work (brief M1/M2/M3) is landed — with the M4 verdict on the record.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [x] M4 verdict written with process-count and cross-stall evidence — yes on the engine, OUT on policy (brief `#record-m4`).
- [x] Idle attribution closed arithmetically (±25% from both arms independently) with every waker named (brief `#record-idle`).
- [x] at0292 (idle silence: 0 DOM writes/s settled) committed and green.
- [ ] **Release idle busy ≤1.5% ×3 — MISSED.** Measured 9.1% / 8.3% / 7.8% on an unattended release deck, mean 8.4% against a 8.3% starting point: no measurable change. Attributed — style invalidation, which this phase's work attacks, is only 0.5% of wall on the real deck (brief `#record-release`).
- [x] at0293 committed and green — **on frame gap**, p50 17 / p95 18. The originally budgeted keystroke→post-paint p50 < 9ms was unreachable in principle at 60Hz ([P08], amended).
- [x] After-layout walk under typing attributed: **[H6] refuted** by dose-response; containment never productized because the hypothesis it served died (brief `#record-typing`).
- [x] Sparkline tape painted in a worker. **Pulse card eyeball still owed** (R03).
- [x] Per-window process pool landed and verified. **M1 offload NOT landed — [Q04] has no target**, and [P07] forbids a speculative one (brief `#record-m1`).
- [x] Brief record complete through `#record-close`. No `zz-` artifacts remain.

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] `just app-test at0291-perf-instruments.test.ts at0292-idle-silence.test.ts at0293-typing-latency.test.ts`
- [ ] `just app-test-covers-check`

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] Per-card isolation design pass — only if the M4 verdict is yes ([Q01]).
- [ ] Gauge cadence/precision product decision beyond the [Q03] quick fix, if residual churn was quantized.
- [ ] Remaining indicator variants' settled-state costs (archived animation-tuneup [Q06]/step-16/step-18).
- [ ] `tuglaws/motion-residency.md` authorship (archived animation-tuneup step-19).
- [ ] Further worker offloads beyond the Step 10 target, each against its own named profile.
