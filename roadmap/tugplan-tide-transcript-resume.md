## Tide Transcript — Resume from JSONL + v1 Polish {#tide-transcript-resume}

**Purpose:** Close the cross-restart preservation gap that the Tide card transcript currently has — the in-memory `CodeSessionStore.transcript` dies on HMR / Developer-Reload / cold boot, even though Claude Code already persists every turn to a per-session JSONL on disk at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-dir>/<sessionId>.jsonl`. Fix by reading that JSONL on `spawn_session(mode=resume)`, translating its entries to the existing `CODE_OUTPUT` event shape the live wire already speaks, and emitting them through the wire before Claude's freshly-resumed subprocess starts producing live frames. Tugdeck's existing reducer commits each replayed `turn_complete` to `transcript` exactly as it would for a live turn — no client-side rehydration path, no second source of truth, no new persistence layer. Then sweep three small `Roadmap: right away` follow-ons from [tugplan-tug-list-view.md](./tugplan-tug-list-view.md) that don't already have homes in other plans: stable in-flight ↔ committed id, atom-aware user rows, and the `TugListView` prefetching protocol.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

The Tide card transcript shipped in `tugplan-tug-list-view.md` works correctly *within a single browser session*. As soon as the page reloads, HMR replaces the `card-services-store.ts` module, or the user picks Developer > Reload, the transcript pane goes blank — even though Claude itself remembers every word.

Three layers of state preservation already exist around this surface, and none of them carries the transcript content:

1. **`cardSessionBindingStore`** — persisted to tugbank by tugcast under `dev.tugtool.tide.session-keys`. Carries the binding triple `{ tug_session_id, project_dir, claude_session_id }`. On reload, [`tide-session-restore.ts`](../tugdeck/src/lib/tide-session-restore.ts) walks each Tide card, reads the record, and fires `spawn_session(mode=resume)`. **Brings Claude back online with its conversation context, but Claude does not replay prior turns to tugdeck.** Claude knows the conversation; tugdeck doesn't.
2. **`tideSessionLedger`** — sqlite-backed per-session metadata (`turn_count`, `last_used_at`, `first_user_prompt`, lifecycle state). **Does not store the messages themselves.** A directory of sessions, not a conversation archive.
3. **[A9] state preservation** (`useComponentStatePreservation` / `data-tug-state-key` / `data-tug-scroll-key`) — captures form-control values, focus key, scroll position, opt-in component state. **The Tide card uses none of these for the transcript.** `CodeSessionStore.transcript` lives in-memory on a module-singleton store; nothing writes it to a bag.

But — and this is the part that reframes the whole fix — Claude itself writes a complete per-session JSONL to `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-dir>/<sessionId>.jsonl`. Sample listing on this machine: 992 sessions in this workspace alone, kilobytes each. Every `user_message`, every `assistant_text` block, every `tool_use` and `tool_result`, every `turn_complete`. That JSONL is what `claude --resume` reads to reconstitute Claude's own conversation context. The data already exists. We just don't read it.

So the fix is not "persist transcripts via [A9] bag" (a parallel storage layer to a JSONL that's already on disk — explicitly rejected as a non-starter). The fix is to teach the supervisor to read the JSONL on resume and replay its events through `CODE_OUTPUT`. The translation table already lives in tugcode's `session.ts` (live stream-json → IPC outbound messages); we extend it slightly to handle the JSONL-archive shape, gate the replay on a small bracket protocol, and let tugdeck's reducer commit each `turn_complete` to `transcript` the same way it commits live ones. **One source of truth (the JSONL on disk), one ingestion path (the existing reducer), one rendering path (the `TideTranscriptDataSource`)**.

The reducer doesn't need to know "live" vs "replayed." The list view doesn't need to know. The cell renderers don't need to know. The transcript appears, the user scrolls back, and the surface looks like it never lost a thing — because it never did, the bytes were on disk all along.

After the resume work, the `Roadmap: right away` list from the parent plan has eight items. Three already have homes elsewhere: picker migration is its own plan (per [tugplan-tide-session-ledger.md](./tugplan-tide-session-ledger.md)); markdown styling is parent [§step-12](./tugplan-tide-card-polish.md#step-12); thinking + tool surfaces is parent [§step-13](./tugplan-tide-card-polish.md#step-13). One — imperative DOM cell pooling, with native-selection survival as its side-effect resolution — is a structural shift to `TugListView` v2 that warrants its own plan; promoted to #roadmap below. That leaves three small polish items this plan absorbs: **stable in-flight ↔ committed id**, **atom-aware user rows**, and the **`TugListView` prefetching protocol**.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **Persist `claude_session_id` first.** The Path A wire-replay machinery is gated on the supervisor knowing which JSONL to read for each card on resume. Today, `claude_session_id` is captured in-memory but never persisted — the [§P14](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume) work absorbed as Step 0 closes that gap. Without it, every reload spawns a fresh Claude subprocess and there is no JSONL to replay.
- **Disk is the source of truth.** Claude's per-session JSONL is the canonical conversation archive. tugdeck and the supervisor are downstream consumers. We add no new persistence layer; we read what's already there.
- **The wire is the seam.** Replay events ride `CODE_OUTPUT` in the same shape live events use, with a small bracket protocol (`replay_started` → events → `replay_complete`) so tugdeck's reducer can gate phase transitions and id-stability heuristics correctly. No new feed.
- **The reducer is the ingestion path.** No client-side rehydration method on `CodeSessionStore`, no parallel "snapshot rehydrate" code path. The reducer that handles live turns handles replayed ones — it just sees them arrive in a tighter time window, gated by a new `replaying` phase ([D11]).
- **Replay is bounded and synchronous w.r.t. live frames.** Replay frames flush on tugcode's IPC stdout *before* tugcode forwards live events translated from Claude's stdout for the same session. The boundary is at tugcode's IPC stdout, not at Claude's pipe — Claude can be running, emitting stream-json, and tugcode buffers its translated output until `replay_complete` has been written to IPC. No interleaving; no race.
- **Translation is a tugcode concern, not a tugcast concern.** `tugcode/src/session.ts` already owns the live stream-json → `OutboundMessage` translation. JSONL handling (a sibling shape, lightly different from live stream-json) lives in `tugcode/src/replay.ts`. One translation vocabulary in one language. The Rust supervisor stays a lifecycle/ledger/binding manager.
- **Replay does not write to disk.** Replay reads the JSONL but does not append to it. The freshly-resumed Claude subprocess does its own JSONL appends as the user submits new turns. We do not double-write.
- **Replay is best-effort, not load-bearing.** A missing, unreadable, or malformed JSONL surfaces as an empty transcript on resume, not a hard error. The card still works; the conversation history is gone for that card (the bytes are still on Claude's side). Logged with structured telemetry; the hard time budget per [D10] guarantees the card becomes interactive within 10s of binding regardless of JSONL state.
- **Honest replay accuracy trade-offs.** Per-row historical model name is *not* preserved in v1 ([D09]); orphan turns at reload synthesize as interrupted ([D08]); claude_session_id mismatches in tugbank vs. on-disk JSONL produce empty transcripts (handled cleanly). Each is documented; each has a follow-on path if it becomes a real complaint.
- **Tuglaws cross-checked at every step.** [L02], [L03], [L06], [L10], [L11], [L19], [L20], [L22], [L23], [L24] apply. See [#tuglaws-cross-check]. L23 in particular is satisfied by a third preservation mechanism — external archive replay — distinct from in-session minimal mutation and cross-session [A9] save/restore.
- **Replay is a request-driven event, not a once-per-subprocess one** (per [D12], added during the recovery phases). Tugdeck dispatches a `request_replay` CONTROL frame whenever it constructs services for a resume binding; tugcast forwards to tugcode; tugcode invokes its existing `runReplay()`. This is the load-bearing flow for Smokes A (HMR) and B (Reload), where tugcode survives the user-visible event but tugdeck's `CodeSessionStore` does not. Smoke C (cold boot) goes through the same verb after rebind. See [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1).
- **Build stays green at every commit.** `bun x tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, `cargo nextest run` pass on every step. Warnings are errors.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- `claude_session_id` is persisted to tugbank in `relay_session_io`'s atomic-promote block and rehydrated on startup; subsequent `spawn_session(mode=resume)` invocations spawn the tugcode subprocess with `--resume <id>` and Claude reloads its conversation context. (Verified: Step 0 unit tests + real-claude integration test `test_close_then_reopen_preserves_history`.)
- A Tide card with N committed turns survives HMR with all N turns visible in the transcript pane after the next render. (Verified: dev-mode Smoke A against a multi-turn session.)
- A Tide card with N committed turns survives Developer > Reload with the transcript intact. (Verified: Smoke B.)
- A cold-boot of Tug.app with a previously-bound card restores the transcript pane to its prior content. (Verified: Smoke C against a real session.)
- A reload mid-stream produces a transcript with the orphan turn committed as interrupted ([D08]). (Verified: Smoke D + integration test.)
- Replay events flow through the existing `CODE_OUTPUT` reducer path; no `CodeSessionStore` method is added that bypasses the dispatcher. (Verified: code review; reducer-level tests.)
- The replayed transcript content is byte-identical to a live recording of the same session, modulo timestamp formatting and the [D09] current-model-on-all-rows trade-off. (Verified: golden-fixture round-trip — record a session live, then replay its JSONL through the supervisor and assert the resulting `transcript` arrays match.)
- A missing or unreadable JSONL produces an empty replay (transcript starts empty for this resume) plus a `lastReplayResult.kind === "jsonl_missing" | "jsonl_unreadable"` snapshot field; the card still mounts and accepts new turns within 10s. (Verified: integration test pointing the supervisor at a non-existent JSONL.)
- A long JSONL replay respects [D10]'s budget thresholds: the placeholder transitions to a count-aware variant after 2s and the card becomes interactive within 10s regardless of JSONL size. (Verified: integration test with a synthetic-delay fixture.)
- The replay-committed `code` row's React key transitions exactly **zero** times across the row's lifetime — the JSONL-derived `msg_id` is the row's id from frame zero ([D07]). (Verified: adapter test asserts id stability for replay turns.)
- Live-turn flicker is unchanged from v1 ([D07]'s honest scope) — the seed transition for live in-flight turns continues to remount once at first delta and is documented as a follow-on resolved by imperative DOM pooling.
- The `TugListView` prefetching protocol exposes `delegate.prefetchForIndices` and `delegate.cancelPrefetchForIndices` and dispatches them based on a viewport-prediction window; a delegate that opts in observes prefetch / cancel calls in correct order on scroll. (Verified: `TugListView` unit tests.)
- The `user` cell renderer accepts `AtomSegment[]` content and renders atoms inline alongside text once `userMessage.attachments` carries the typed shape. (Verified: cell-renderer unit test against a fixture turn whose `attachments` is `AtomSegment[]`.)
- `bun x tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, `cargo nextest run` green at every step.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. **`claude_session_id` persistence + resume threading** ([§P14](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume) absorbed). Persists in the atomic-promote block; `rebind_from_tugbank` rehydrates; `TugcodeSpawner` threads `--resume <id>`; `do_reset_session` invalidates. Step 0.
2. **JSONL → `CODE_OUTPUT` translator** in tugcode (TypeScript). Pure module; unit-testable against fixture JSONLs. Surveyed shape coverage per [D06]; orphan-turn synthesis per [D08]; batched async iteration per [D10].
3. **Replay bracket events** (`replay_started`, `replay_complete`) on `CODE_OUTPUT` per [D05]. Small additive shape; the reducer recognizes them and uses them to gate phase transitions.
4. **`replaying` phase value** on `CodeSessionSnapshot.phase` per [D11]. Drives `canSubmit: false` and the `TideRestoring` placeholder via `data-phase` cascade.
5. **Reducer handling for replay frames** in tugdeck. Idempotent commits via msg-id dedupe ([D04]); phase transitions to `replaying` during replay; `inflightUserMessage` is cleared defensively; replay-frame events do not echo back as `user_message` CODE_INPUT writes.
6. **Resume-spawn replay wire-up** in tugcode. On `--resume-session <id>`, tugcode emits replay events on its IPC stdout *before* it forwards live events from Claude's stdout for the same session. Live events from Claude during the replay window are buffered and flushed after `replay_complete`.
7. **Tide card "Loading conversation…" UX** — the `TideRestoring` placeholder gains a count-aware variant for [D10]'s soft-budget state and a timeout-state variant for the hard-budget cutoff.
7a. **Recovery: cold-boot diagnostic capture** ([Phase A-R0](#phase-a-r0)). Add `just tail-tugcast` + `just tail-replay` recipes; capture Smoke C telemetry; root-cause Candidate 3 (path encoding mismatch); land the realpath fix.
7a'. **Recovery: fold replay clock into `CodeSessionStore`; consolidate banner; preflight UX** ([Step R0c](#step-r0c)). Three faults, one fix-shape: (1) [Step 4](#step-4) shipped `useEffect` timers in `TideCardServicesGate` that violate the [L02] / [L24] zone boundary; (2) cold-boot Bug X — 5–10s blank-card window with no feedback; (3) `TideCardBody` already mounts two independent `<TugPaneBanner>` instances and adding a third would race on the portal slot. Resolved by folding the time-derived flags into `CodeSessionStore`'s reducer + effect-list (one `useSyncExternalStore` subscription, no `useEffect` timers anywhere), consolidating the three banners into one driven by a precedence chain (`error > transport > replay-timeout > replay-loading > none`), and surfacing replay status as a banner instead of the heavier `TideRestoring` backdrop.
7a''. **Recovery: tugcode startup-order refactor** ([Step R0d](#step-r0d)). Address Bug Y — the 5–10s wait itself. Run `runReplay()` before spawning claude; spawn claude asynchronously in the background. Replay events flow within ~100ms; claude is ready by the time the user submits a new turn.
7b. **Recovery: `request_replay` IPC verb** across tugcode / tugcast / tugdeck per [D12] ([Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1)). Closes the Smoke A/B gap exposed by [Step 5](#step-5)'s manual smokes. Tugdeck dispatches on services construction for resume bindings; tugcast forwards via CONTROL action; tugcode handles inbound and re-runs `runReplay()` re-entrancy-safely.
7c. **Recovery: smoke verification + telemetry capture** ([Phase A-R2](#phase-a-r2)). Manual run of Smokes A/B/C with the new verb in place; mark off the smoke checklist with telemetry quotes.
7d. **Recovery: Smoke D mid-turn ordering** ([Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3)). Pick D-1 (pause-live), D-2 (skip-orphan), or D-3 (defer) and either implement or document the limitation.
7e. **Recovery: convergence cleanup** ([Phase A-R4](#phase-a-r4)). Decide whether the startup-replay path collapses into request-driven, or both stay (with [D04] dedupe as the safety net).
8. **Sticky id for replay-committed turns** in `TideTranscriptDataSource` per [D07]. The replay-committed turn's `msg_id` is the row's id from frame zero — no seed transition. Live-turn flicker is unchanged.
9. **Atom-aware user rows.** `UserRowCell` switches from a plain `<span>` body to a body that renders `userMessage.attachments` as inline atoms when present, falling back to plain text for legacy or attachment-empty turns.
10. **`TugListView` prefetching protocol.** `delegate.prefetchForIndices(indices)` / `delegate.cancelPrefetchForIndices(indices)` plus a viewport-prediction window. Delegate-only — `TugListView` does not assume any specific prefetch behavior; consumers decide.
11. **Tuglaws walkthrough + plan close-out**, mirroring the parent plan's pattern.

Out of scope:
- New persistence layer in tugdeck or in the supervisor's sqlite (Path B / C from the diagnosis — explicit non-starter).
- Imperative DOM cell pooling (its own plan in #roadmap).
- Picker migration onto `TugListView` (its own plan).
- Markdown styling pass for assistant output (parent §step-12).
- Thinking + tool surfaces inside `code` rows (parent §step-13).
- Cmd+J keybinding (its own follow-up plan).
- Cross-machine session export / import. The JSONL is per-machine; "open this conversation on another laptop" is a much larger problem.

#### Resolved Decisions {#resolved-decisions}

Listed in [#design-decisions]. The major calls are summarized here; rationale is in the linked sections.

- [D01] JSONL parsing lives in **tugcode (TypeScript bridge)**, not tugcast (Rust supervisor) — the translation table is already there; one place; one set of tests.
- [D02] Replay frames ride **`CODE_OUTPUT`** with the same event shapes live frames use — no new feed.
- [D03] Replay flushes **synchronously before live frames** for the same `tug_session_id` on tugcode's IPC stdout — Claude's stream-json output is buffered and flushed after `replay_complete`.
- [D04] Replay is **idempotent at the reducer level** via `msg_id` deduping; defense-in-depth against supervisor double-replay.
- [D05] Bracket events are **first-class** — `replay_started` / `replay_complete` are decoded events the reducer handles, not protocol-level metadata.
- [D06] Translation is **direct JSONL → `CODE_OUTPUT`** with the surveyed shape inventory; unknown shapes log + skip per `tide::replay::unknown_shape`.
- [D07] **Sticky id for replay-committed turns only** — the JSONL-derived `msg_id` is the row's id from frame zero; no remount on replay. Live-turn flicker remains unchanged from v1 (resolved by imperative DOM pooling, tracked in #roadmap).
- [D08] **Orphan turns at replay boundary synthesize as `turn_complete(error)`** — interrupted, matching live `interrupt()` semantics; user's submission stays visible with the accumulated assistant text and an interrupted marker.
- [D09] **No SESSION_METADATA replay in v1** — replay-committed code rows show the *current* model name; per-row historical model tracked as a follow-on.
- [D10] **Replay performance budget** — soft 2s (placeholder gains count-aware copy), hard 10s (truncate replay; resume with empty transcript); incremental batched commit so the UI stays responsive.
- [D11] **`replaying` phase value** on `CodeSessionSnapshot.phase` — drives `canSubmit: false` and the placeholder via the existing `data-phase` cascade.
- [D12] **Request-driven replay** (recovery) — tugcode handles an inbound `request_replay` verb that re-runs `runReplay()` on an already-live subprocess. Closes the gap [Step 5](#step-5)'s smokes exposed: a fresh tugdeck `CodeSessionStore` for a session whose tugcode is still up has no replay events to consume without this verb. See [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1).

### Resolved Questions / Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [D01] JSONL parsing in tugcode (DECIDED) {#d01-translator-location}

**Decision:** The JSONL → `CODE_OUTPUT` translator lives in `tugcode/src/session.ts` (or a sibling module imported by it), TypeScript, in the bridge subprocess. The Rust supervisor is *not* extended with JSONL parsing.

**Rationale:**

- `tugcode/src/session.ts` already owns the live stream-json → `OutboundMessage` translation table — the same vocabulary the JSONL uses for its event payloads (modulo the JSONL-specific wrapper fields). Extending that module to handle the JSONL archive shape keeps one translator in one place; adding a parallel translator in Rust would mean two-way drift maintenance.
- The bridge subprocess is the natural place: it already opens, reads, and routes per-session I/O. Adding a "before opening Claude's stdout, read this JSONL and emit translated events" path is a local change to its startup flow.
- The supervisor's job is session lifecycle (spawn, close, error, reset). Reading conversational content is downstream of lifecycle and belongs to the layer that already speaks Claude's wire shapes.
- TypeScript is the right language for parsing JSON line-by-line with the kind of permissive, evolving shapes Claude's JSONL exhibits — the live translator already does this.

**Implications:**

- A new `tugcode/src/replay.ts` (or similar) exports a pure `translateJsonlEntry(entry)` function unit-testable against fixture JSONLs.
- `tugcode/src/session.ts`'s startup path branches on `--session-mode`: for `resume`, read the JSONL before opening Claude's stdout; for `new`, current path.
- No Rust-side JSONL handling. The supervisor remains a lifecycle/ledger/binding manager.

**Alternative considered:**

- Rust-side parsing in `agent_supervisor.rs`: rejected because the translation vocabulary is already in TypeScript, replicating it would create drift, and the supervisor's job is lifecycle, not content.

---

#### [D02] Replay rides `CODE_OUTPUT` (DECIDED) {#d02-replay-channel}

**Decision:** Replay frames are emitted on the existing `CODE_OUTPUT` feed (`0x40`) using the same event shapes live frames use. No new feed; no new feed-id allocation.

**Rationale:**

- The reducer already handles every event shape replay needs (`assistant_text`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `tool_use_structured`, `turn_complete`, `cost_update`, `system_metadata`). Adding a separate feed would force duplication.
- A new feed would also require new client-side wiring on `FeedStore`, on the per-card session filter, on telemetry. Riding `CODE_OUTPUT` is additive at zero cost.
- The bracket events ([D05]) carry the "this is replay, not live" signal. The reducer needs that signal once, at the bracket boundary, not on every event.

**Implications:**

- No `protocol.ts` `FeedId` table changes.
- The session filter (`tug_session_id`) on `CODE_OUTPUT` already routes replay frames correctly because they carry the same id as live frames for that session.
- Telemetry and lifecycle logs distinguish replay vs live via the bracket events, not via feed id.

---

#### [D03] Replay flushes synchronously before live (DECIDED) {#d03-replay-ordering}

**Decision:** For a given `tug_session_id`, all replay frames for that session flush before any live frame for that session reaches `CODE_OUTPUT`. The supervisor gates the freshly-resumed Claude subprocess's stdout pipe until replay completes.

**Rationale:**

- Interleaving replay and live would require msg-id dedupe at the reducer (already on the table as a defense-in-depth, see [D04]) plus complex ordering logic. Synchronous flush is simpler.
- The replay is bounded — it's "the JSONL I have on disk" — so its size is known up front and the supervisor can promise "all of this lands before any of that."
- The user's perceptual order — "transcript appears, then live turns appear" — matches the wire order when replay is flushed first.

**Implications:**

- The `replay_complete` bracket event ([D05]) is the supervisor's commit point: once it's emitted, live frames for this session are unblocked.
- The bridge subprocess's spawn point is gated: the freshly-resumed `tugcode` is allowed to start emitting only after `replay_complete` lands.
- A failure to read the JSONL does NOT block live frames — `replay_started` is emitted, then immediately `replay_complete` is emitted with an `error` field; the card observes the failed-replay state, surfaces a small notice if appropriate, and resumes live ingestion.

---

#### [D04] Reducer-level idempotency (DECIDED — defense-in-depth) {#d04-idempotency}

**Decision:** The reducer dedupes `turn_complete` events by `msg_id` — committing a `TurnEntry` for a `msg_id` that already exists in `transcript` is a silent no-op (with a debug log). This is **defense-in-depth, not load-bearing**: the supervisor's contract per [D03] is that replay frames for a given session flush before live frames and never re-emit a turn that's already on disk.

**Rationale:**

- A bug in the supervisor that re-emits the same turn (e.g. a misordered replay-vs-live during a fast reconnect) should produce a duplicate transcript row in the worst case, not corrupted state.
- Msg-id dedupe is cheap — `Set<msgId>` on the reducer side; O(1) per `turn_complete`.
- It also means a user can manually replay a JSONL fragment in dev tools for debugging without committing duplicates.

**Implications:**

- `CodeSessionState` gains a `committedMsgIds: Set<string>` (or its functional equivalent — likely `transcript.map(t => t.msgId)` recomputed on demand, since transcript size stays bounded by Claude's session length).
- Tests: a synthetic re-emit of a turn with the same msg_id produces no transcript change.

---

#### [D05] First-class bracket events (DECIDED) {#d05-bracket-events}

**Decision:** Two new event types ride `CODE_OUTPUT`:

```ts
{ type: "replay_started", tug_session_id: string }
{ type: "replay_complete", tug_session_id: string, count: number, error?: { kind: string; message: string } }
```

These are decoded events the reducer handles, not protocol-level metadata. The reducer:
- On `replay_started`: snapshot the current `phase` (which should be `idle` post-spawn-ack), enter a `replaying` sub-state that is internal to the reducer (not surfaced as a new phase value yet — see [D08] below for the snapshot-phase question).
- On `replay_complete`: leave `replaying`, restore the snapshot phase, commit any final state derived from replay.

**Rationale:**

- Inline metadata on every event ("is this a replay?") is noisy and makes individual events harder to reason about.
- Bracket events match how the test catalog already treats turn boundaries — discrete, observable, named.
- They give telemetry a single observable point per replay (count, duration, error).

**Implications:**

- Tugcode emits the bracket events around the JSONL-derived stream.
- The reducer adds two cases to its event-handler switch.
- `CodeSessionSnapshot` exposes the bracket signal via the new `replaying` phase value per [D11], plus the `lastReplayResult` field for telemetry / dev surface.

#### [D06] Direct JSONL → `CODE_OUTPUT` (DECIDED) {#d06-direct-translation}

**Decision:** The translator goes directly from JSONL entries to the `CODE_OUTPUT` `OutboundMessage` shape, bypassing the live-stream-json intermediate format.

**Rationale:**

- JSONL entries have their own field layout (`parentUuid`, `promptId`, `message.role`, `message.content[]`, `toolUseResult`, etc.) — they're Claude's *internal* persistence format, not the live wire format.
- Going JSONL → stream-json → `OutboundMessage` would require synthesizing stream-json tokens (`stream_event` wrappers, `delta` annotations, `is_partial` flags) that don't exist in the JSONL — fabricating events.
- Going direct produces complete `OutboundMessage`s for committed turns: a single `assistant_text` with `is_partial: false`, no streaming partials. Replay should land a turn at a time, not stream it character-by-character — the user is resuming, not watching a fresh response.

**Surveyed JSONL shapes (real `~/.claude/projects/<dir>/*.jsonl` files on this machine).** Top-level entry types observed across 30+ files:

| Top-level `type` | Frequency | Translator action |
|---|---|---|
| `assistant` | high — most lines after `user` | translate per `message.content[]` block (text → `assistant_text`, `tool_use` → `tool_use`, `thinking` → `thinking_text`); `stop_reason: "end_turn"` marks the turn boundary and triggers `turn_complete(success)` |
| `user` | high | distinguish: a `user` entry whose `message.content[]` carries `text` blocks is a user submission → `user_message`; one whose content is `tool_result` blocks is a tool response → `tool_result` event(s) keyed on `tool_use_id` |
| `attachment` | medium — bracketing user messages | skip (Claude bookkeeping; tool listings, skill listings, file references — not transcript-visible) |
| `queue-operation` | low | skip (Claude's internal scheduling marker) |
| `last-prompt` | low | skip (bookmark for `--continue`; not transcript content) |
| `file-history-snapshot` | low — long sessions only | skip (Claude's file-tracking metadata) |
| `ai-title` | low | skip (Claude's auto-generated session title; not transcript) |
| `system` | low — once per session | skip (`system_init`-style bookkeeping; live `session_init` from the resumed Claude subprocess populates `SessionMetadataStore`, see [D09]) |
| `permission-mode` | low — on permission changes | skip (UI-visible at the chrome layer, not the transcript) |

Content blocks observed inside `message.content[]`:

| Block `type` | Translator action |
|---|---|
| `text` | `assistant_text(is_partial: false)` (when on `assistant`); included verbatim in user submission text (when on `user`) |
| `tool_use` | `tool_use` event with the block's `id`, `name`, `input` |
| `tool_result` | `tool_result` event keyed on `tool_use_id`; `is_error` and content carried through |
| `thinking` | `thinking_text(is_partial: false)` |
| `image` | translator emits the `user_message` with an attachment; no `image` is shown in the v1 user-row body (out of scope per [D11] from the parent plan) |

**Open shape policy.** Claude's JSONL format evolves with new releases — the inventory above is "what we observed, when we surveyed." Unknown top-level types and unknown content-block types are **logged via `tide::replay::unknown_shape` telemetry and skipped**. The drift signal is observable; the transcript stays best-effort. A future P15-style version-gate could promote unknown shapes to a structured divergence event, but v1 picks the simpler "log + skip" path.

**Turn-boundary detection.** A turn's terminal event is the `assistant` entry with `message.stop_reason: "end_turn"`. All `assistant` entries with `stop_reason: "tool_use"` or `null` are intermediate — emit their content blocks but don't fire `turn_complete` yet. The translator carries a small per-turn buffer (`current_msg_id`, accumulated text, accumulated tool-call set) that's flushed as a `turn_complete(success)` when the terminal `end_turn` lands.

**Implications:**

- Translator: `function translateJsonlEntry(entry, ctx): OutboundMessage[]` where `ctx` carries the per-session id, msg-id sequencing, the per-turn buffer, and the current `current_msg_id`.
- Per-turn output is a fixed sequence: `user_message` (echoing the user's submission), then any `tool_use` / `tool_result` events interleaved per `tool_use_id`, then `thinking_text` (if any) before the terminal text, then a single `assistant_text(is_partial: false)`, then `turn_complete(success)`.
- Replayed turns thus look to the reducer like very fast live turns: open, possibly some tool work, terminal text, complete. The reducer's existing turn-commit machinery handles them.

**Alternative considered:**

- Going through stream-json: rejected because synthesis adds complexity for no benefit; the JSONL already records the canonical shape of what Claude actually produced.

#### [D07] Sticky seed for replay-committed turns (DECIDED) {#d07-sticky-seed}

**Decision:** For turns landing via replay, the `TideTranscriptDataSource` reads `msg_id` from the JSONL-derived `turn_complete` event and uses `${msgId}-{user|code}` as the row's id from frame zero. No seed rewrite, no remount. **Live-turn flicker (the v1 awaiting-first-token remount) is unaffected by this step** and remains a tracked follow-on, naturally resolved by the imperative-DOM-pool plan.

**Rationale:**

- The v1 protocol's seed transition exists because, on a live submit, `activeMsgId` is unknown until the first `assistant_text` partial lands. Replay-committed turns don't have this gap — the JSONL carries the full `msg_id` up front, so the data source mints a stable id at commit time.
- Trying to "fix" live-turn flicker via the same sticky-seed mechanism doesn't actually work: any rewrite of the React wrapper's key string identity is a remount, regardless of how cleverly the data source tracks the seed-to-real transition. The honest win is replay-correctness; live flicker needs DOM that survives wrapper-key changes (imperative pool), not a smarter id protocol.
- The patch happens inside the data source's id-resolution function — not inside React state. The reducer is unaffected.

**Implications:**

- `TideTranscriptDataSource.idForIndex(index)` for replay-committed indices reads `transcript[k].msgId` directly and returns `${msgId}-{user|code}`. No seed; no rewrite path engaged.
- For live in-flight indices, the v1 protocol stays: `${INFLIGHT_ID_SEED}-{user|code}` until `activeMsgId` is set, then `${activeMsgId}-{user|code}`. The single remount per live turn is preserved as a documented follow-on, not a regression.
- Tests assert: replay-committed turns produce id stability across the entire turn lifecycle (no seed transition observed); live turns continue to exhibit the v1 single-remount behavior.

**Corrects the parent plan's optimistic framing.** The `Roadmap: right away` bullet in [tugplan-tug-list-view.md #roadmap](./tugplan-tug-list-view.md#roadmap) implied a more general "stable in-flight ↔ committed id" win is possible. That implication is wrong without a DOM-survives-key-changes mechanism (imperative pool). This step ships the genuine, scoped win.

---

#### [D08] In-flight turn at replay boundary (DECIDED) {#d08-orphan-turn}

**Decision:** When the JSONL ends mid-turn — the last `assistant` entry has `stop_reason: "tool_use"` or `null`, or the last entry is a `user` submission with no answering `assistant` — the translator synthesizes a `turn_complete(error)` (interrupted) for the orphaned turn. The accumulated text is preserved, matching what the reducer does on a live `interrupt()` ([tugplan-code-session-store.md test-06 path](../tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v2.1.105/test-06-interrupt-mid-stream.jsonl)).

**Rationale:**

- A reload mid-stream is a real, common case (user closes laptop while a response is generating; HMR fires while a tool is running). The orphan turn is on disk; it has user-visible content the user *put there*.
- Three options exist: (a) skip orphans entirely (last user_message visible-but-unanswered, jarring); (b) synthesize `turn_complete(success)` (lies — Claude didn't finish); (c) synthesize `turn_complete(error)` (matches Claude's own "interrupted" semantics). (c) is correct.
- The reducer already handles `turn_complete(error)` cleanly via the interrupt path. The committed `TurnEntry.result` is `"interrupted"`, which is the truthful state of what happened.

**Implications:**

- The translator carries a per-turn buffer; at end-of-file, if the buffer holds a turn that hasn't seen its terminal `end_turn`, it emits the synthesized `turn_complete(error)` before `replay_complete`.
- An orphan turn with no `assistant` content at all (user submitted, page reloaded before Claude responded) lands as a `TurnEntry` with `assistant: ""` and `result: "interrupted"`. The cell renderer handles empty assistant text gracefully.
- A test in Step 1 covers this: a fixture JSONL that ends mid-turn produces a transcript with the orphan committed as interrupted.

**Alternative considered:**

- Skip orphans: rejected because the user's submission visibly disappears, which is a different kind of regression than the one we're fixing.

---

#### [D09] SESSION_METADATA replay policy (DECIDED) {#d09-metadata-policy}

**Decision:** v1 does **not** replay `SESSION_METADATA` events. The live `system_init` / `system_metadata` from the resumed Claude subprocess populates `SessionMetadataStore.model` for the current session. All replay-committed `code` rows display the **current** model name in their identifier line, even if the historical session spanned model changes.

**Rationale:**

- Replaying SESSION_METADATA per-turn would produce flicker as different replayed rows commit with different historical models. UI ergonomics > strict accuracy for v1.
- The Tide card's chrome shows the current model — the transcript inheriting that name is consistent with the rest of the surface.
- The historical model is observable in the JSONL (each `assistant` entry's `message.model` field). A future refinement could surface per-row historical model when a session is known to span versions, but that's a polish item, not a v1 concern.

**Implications:**

- The translator does not emit any `SESSION_METADATA` events; it only emits CODE_OUTPUT events.
- `useSessionModelName(sessionMetadataStore)` returns the same value for every code row in the rendered transcript — which is what users will expect.
- Documented as a known-trade-off in [#roadmap]: "per-row historical model in transcripts."

**Known surface artifact — model-name flash on resume.** Replay-committed code rows commit *before* the resumed Claude subprocess emits its post-`--resume` `system_init` (which lands on the live wire after `replay_complete`). For the gap between `replay_complete` and that first live `system_init`, `useSessionModelName(sessionMetadataStore)` returns `null` and `CodeCommittedRowCell` shows `CODE_DEFAULT_IDENTIFIER = "Code"` for every replayed row. Once `system_init` lands, all rows flip to the model name in the same render. This brief flash is acceptable for v1 (it matches the pre-binding cold-start behavior of the live path) but worth recording so a future polish item can pre-stage the metadata read from the JSONL's `system` entry, or hold the placeholder for a few hundred ms longer. Not a blocker.

**Alternative considered:**

- Replay per-turn `SESSION_METADATA`: rejected for v1 because the UI consequence (model-name flicker on resume scroll) is worse than the accuracy gain.

---

#### [D10] Replay performance budget (DECIDED) {#d10-perf-budget}

**Decision:** Replay runs incrementally with two budget thresholds:

- **Soft budget — 2 seconds.** If `replay_complete` hasn't landed by 2s after `replay_started`, the `TideRestoring` placeholder updates from "Loading conversation…" to "Loading conversation… (N turns)" with a live count. The placeholder remains visible; the user sees progress.
- **Hard budget — 10 seconds.** If `replay_complete` hasn't landed by 10s, the placeholder switches to "Conversation history unavailable; resuming with empty transcript" and the supervisor truncates remaining replay output. Live frames flow normally afterward; the user can submit new turns.

**Implementation:**

- The translator emits replay events in batches (e.g. 16 turns per `await new Promise(setImmediate)`) so the IPC pipe stays responsive and the per-turn `turn_complete` lands at the reducer with enough yield for the React layer to repaint.
- The supervisor times the replay window per session and includes timing in the structured `tide::replay::complete` log line.
- The hard timeout fires from the supervisor side; the translator drops remaining JSONL lines and emits `replay_complete { error: { kind: "replay_timeout", message: "..." } }`.

**Rationale:**

- Real machines have JSONLs of 37K+ lines (largest on this dev machine). Synchronous parse-and-emit of that whole file blocks the IPC pipe for seconds.
- Without a budget, a slow disk or a corrupted JSONL produces a stuck "Loading conversation…" pane with no recovery. The hard cutoff guarantees a Tide card always becomes interactive within 10s of binding.
- The soft-budget count update is cheap and gives the user a sense of "still working."

**Implications:**

- A new `tide::replay::progress` structured log line fires every batch with the running count.
- The placeholder copy in `TideRestoring` gains a count-aware variant for the soft-budget state.
- A Step 5 test covers the hard-budget path: a fixture JSONL with synthetic delay produces the truncated state.

---

#### [D11] Snapshot `replaying` phase (DECIDED — supersedes prior open question) {#d11-replaying-phase}

**Decision:** `CodeSessionSnapshot.phase` gains a `replaying` value. The reducer enters `replaying` on `replay_started` and leaves on `replay_complete`. `canSubmit` is `false` while `replaying`. `canInterrupt` is `false`. The prompt entry's existing `data-phase` cascade picks up the new value automatically.

**Rationale:**

- The alternative — keeping replay state internal and deriving `canSubmit` from a private flag — leaks every consumer that wants to know about replay through a separate channel. A single phase value is the canonical signal the snapshot already uses.
- `phase` is a discriminated union; adding a value is additive. Existing consumers that switch on `phase` get a TypeScript exhaustiveness error if they forget the new case — surfaces the change at build time, which is exactly what we want.
- The prompt entry already disables submit while `phase` is non-idle; the new value rides that path with zero new wiring.

**Implications:**

- `CodeSessionPhase` union extended with `"replaying"`.
- Reducer's `canSubmit` derivation: `phase === "idle" && transportState === "online"` becomes `(phase === "idle" || phase === "errored") && transportState === "online"` (the existing form) — `replaying` naturally falls outside the OR.
- `canInterrupt` derivation excludes `replaying`.
- Existing exhaustiveness checks at consumer sites flag the new case at compile time — fix-forward.

---

#### [D12] Request-driven replay (DECIDED — recovery) {#d12-request-driven-replay}

**Decision (post-Step R4):** Replay in tugcode is request-driven via the inbound IPC verb `request_replay`. Tugcast forwards the verb from a wire CONTROL frame to tugcode's stdin (queueing during the supervisor's Spawning window so cold-boot delivery is reliable). Tugdeck dispatches the verb whenever `cardServicesStore` constructs services for a binding with `sessionMode === "resume"` and the wire is online. The verb is the **single trigger** — Step R4 ([Phase A-R4](#phase-a-r4)) collapsed the dual-path arrangement that briefly existed during Phase A-R1 / R1.5.

**Rationale (recovery context).** [Step 5](#step-5)'s manual smokes exposed that v1's "replay fires when tugcode starts in resume mode, exactly once per subprocess lifetime" assumption is too narrow to carry the feature's user-visible promise. Three of the four transition classes — HMR, Reload, mid-turn — keep tugcode alive across the user-observed event; tugdeck's `CodeSessionStore` is rebuilt fresh and receives no replay because `do_spawn_session` for an already-`Live` ledger entry returns `should_spawn=false` ([`agent_supervisor.rs:1555`](../tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs)) and never restarts tugcode. A request-driven verb closes the gap without touching the supervisor's session-lifecycle ([Q01]) state machine.

**Why a verb (and not subprocess respawn).** Respawning tugcode on every reconnect would kill in-flight turns mid-stream ([D08] mid-turn reload becomes lossy by construction). A verb runs alongside the live-forwarding loop and lets the same tugcode subprocess emit replay events while continuing to serve subsequent input.

**Why it's safe to fire idempotently.** [D04]'s msg_id dedupe at the reducer makes a redundant replay (e.g. tugdeck's R1c dispatch firing again on a re-construct) commit the transcript exactly once. Tugcode's `runReplay` ([Step 3](#step-3)) is the single execution path; the verb wires it up. Tugcode's own `replayActive` re-entrancy guard (Step R1a) drops a verb that arrives mid-replay so the wire doesn't see overlapping brackets.

**Implications:**

- New tugcode `InboundMessage` type `{type: "request_replay"}` (plus type guard).
- New tugcast bridge handler that recognizes a CONTROL action `request_replay {tug_session_id}` and writes the JSON-line to tugcode's stdin via the existing per-session `input_tx` channel.
- New tugdeck session-lifecycle helper `sendRequestReplay(tugSessionId)`; dispatch hook in `cardServicesStore._construct`.
- `runReplay` becomes re-entrancy-safe: a second invocation while replay is in flight is dropped with telemetry (the original replay's events satisfy the request).
- Two replay-trigger paths coexist (startup + request-driven) until [Phase A-R4](#phase-a-r4) decides whether to converge them.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Always respawn tugcode on `spawn_session(resume)`.** Rejected — kills in-flight turns; bad mid-turn UX.
- **Persist transcript in tugbank.** Rejected — explicit non-starter per [#scope] (parallel persistence layer).
- **Cache CODE_OUTPUT events in tugcast and replay on WS reconnect.** Rejected — tugcast becomes responsible for an in-memory event log per session that grows unbounded; the JSONL on disk is already canonical.

### Specification {#specification}

#### Replay protocol shape {#replay-protocol}

Two new event types on `CODE_OUTPUT`:

```ts
interface ReplayStartedEvent {
  type: "replay_started";
  tug_session_id: string;
}

interface ReplayCompleteEvent {
  type: "replay_complete";
  tug_session_id: string;
  count: number;          // number of turns committed during this replay
  error?: {
    kind:
      | "jsonl_missing"        // file does not exist at expected path
      | "jsonl_unreadable"     // file exists but cannot be read (permissions, etc.)
      | "jsonl_malformed"      // file exists, partial parse failures
      | "replay_timeout";      // [D10] hard-budget timeout
    message: string;
  };
}
```

Between `replay_started` and `replay_complete`, the bridge emits the same event shapes the live wire produces — but with `is_partial: false` on every text event (replay is per-turn, not per-token, see [D06]).

#### `CodeSessionPhase` extension per [D11] {#code-session-phase}

```ts
type CodeSessionPhase =
  | "idle"
  | "submitting"
  | "awaiting_first_token"
  | "streaming"
  | "tool_work"
  | "awaiting_approval"
  | "replaying"           // NEW — set on `replay_started`, cleared on `replay_complete`
  | "errored";
```

`canSubmit` is false during `replaying`; `canInterrupt` is false during `replaying`. The Tide card's existing `data-phase` cascade picks up the new value automatically.

#### `CodeSessionSnapshot.lastReplayResult` (NEW) {#last-replay-result}

```ts
interface LastReplayResult {
  kind: "success" | "jsonl_missing" | "jsonl_unreadable" | "jsonl_malformed" | "replay_timeout";
  message: string;
  count: number;            // turns committed before the result was determined
  at: number;               // Date.now() at `replay_complete`
}
```

`null` until the first `replay_complete` lands; populated on **every** `replay_complete` thereafter, including success (`kind: "success"`, `message: ""`). The `TideRestoring` placeholder reads this for the timeout-state copy; telemetry / dev-surface readers can distinguish success from each error variant by `kind`. Cleared back to `null` only on a fresh `replay_started` for the next resume.

#### `TideRowDescriptor` change for atom-aware user rows {#atom-aware-row}

```ts
export interface TideRowDescriptor {
  kind: TideTranscriptCellKind;
  turn?: TurnEntry;
  inflight?: CodeSessionSnapshot["inflightUserMessage"];
}
```

stays unchanged — the atom segments live on `turn.userMessage.attachments` (which evolves to `ReadonlyArray<AtomSegment>` once the prompt entry's atom flow lands; see [Step 7](#step-7)).

#### `TugListViewDelegate` prefetching extension {#prefetch-delegate}

```ts
export interface TugListViewDelegate {
  // ... existing optional members ...

  /**
   * Fires when an index enters the prefetch window (a small band ahead
   * of and behind the rendered window). Consumers that need to warm
   * up resources before a cell mounts (e.g. fetch a remote attachment,
   * decode a thumbnail) opt in via this hook. The list view does NOT
   * call `cellRenderers[kind]` for prefetched indices — they are
   * informational only.
   */
  prefetchForIndices?(indices: ReadonlyArray<number>): void;

  /**
   * Fires when a previously-prefetched index leaves the prefetch
   * window without mounting (e.g. the user reversed scroll direction).
   * Consumers cancel any in-flight prefetch work.
   */
  cancelPrefetchForIndices?(indices: ReadonlyArray<number>): void;
}
```

Default behavior (`undefined` delegate methods): no prefetching; current v1 behavior unchanged.

### Tuglaws Cross-Check {#tuglaws-cross-check}

- **L01** — One `root.render()`. No new component-level renders. ✓
- **L02** — External state via `useSyncExternalStore`. Replay events reach React via the existing reducer-snapshot path; the new `replaying` phase value flows through the same snapshot subscription. ✓
- **L03** — `useLayoutEffect` for registrations events depend on. The "loading conversation…" placeholder mounts via the existing `TideRestoring` flow — no new layout-effect work. ✓
- **L04** — Never measure child DOM inline. Replay does not touch DOM directly. ✓
- **L06** — Appearance via CSS / DOM. The "loading" beat reuses the `TideRestoring` styles plus a count-aware variant for [D10]'s soft-budget state. ✓
- **L10** — One responsibility per layer. Translator lives in tugcode (where the live stream-json → `OutboundMessage` translation already lives, per [D01]); session lifecycle stays in tugcast supervisor; UI placeholder stays in the Tide card. No layer reaches across. ✓
- **L11** — Controls emit, responders own state. Prefetch dispatch fires `delegate.prefetchForIndices`; consumer responders handle as appropriate. ✓
- **L19** — Component authoring guide. No new tugways primitives in this plan. ✓
- **L20** — Token sovereignty. No new tokens introduced. ✓
- **L22** — Store observers may write DOM. The streaming `code` cell's observer pattern is unaffected — replay produces only committed cells. ✓
- **L23** — User-visible state preserved across DOM-down transitions. **This plan satisfies L23 via a third preservation mechanism — external archive replay.** The two mechanisms named in L23 are *in-session minimal mutation* (DOM stays alive across pane moves / activations / cmd-tab) and *cross-session [A9] save/restore* (DOM comes down, bag captures and restores user-visible state to tugbank). The transcript content is preserved by neither: it lives on Claude's per-session JSONL on disk, written by Claude itself as the session progresses. On resume, the supervisor reads the JSONL and replays its events through the wire so the reducer reconstitutes `transcript`. This is a third valid mechanism for the same law — the data is preserved by an external system that is the canonical source of truth, and we read it back at the same moment the protocol calls for restoration. L23's intent ("user data must survive transitions; pick the mechanism that matches the transition class") is met. ✓ (after Phase A lands)
- **L24** — State zones. No new state-zone violations. The `replaying` phase value lives in the structure zone (snapshot field, drives `data-phase` cascade); the placeholder text is appearance zone (CSS-driven via `data-phase`). ✓

**Note on L21.** L21 governs third-party code licensing, not Vite's `import.meta.hot` surface (an earlier plan draft conflated the two). This plan uses no new third-party libraries; L21 has no application here.

### Execution Steps {#execution-steps}

> Each step is its own commit. `bun x tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, and `cargo nextest run` pass at the end of every step.

#### Phase A — Resume from JSONL {#phase-a}

#### Step 0: Persist `claude_session_id` and thread it through resume (absorbs [§P14](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume)) {#step-0}

**Commit:** `tide(resume): persist claude_session_id; thread --resume on rebound spawns`

**References:** [tide.md §P14](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume), [tide.md §T0.5 P14 entry-point table](./tide.md#p2-integration-reference), [agent_supervisor.rs:1484](../tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs)

**Why this is Step 0.** The rest of Phase A reads `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-dir>/<claude_session_id>.jsonl`. Today, `claude_session_id` is captured in-memory in `relay_session_io`'s atomic-promote block but never persisted — `agent_supervisor.rs:1484` writes `claude_session_id: None` on every `spawn_session_ok`, and `rebind_from_tugbank` rehydrates with `None`. Without this step, the subsequent steps have no claude_session_id to key the JSONL lookup on, and Claude itself spawns fresh on every reload (no `--resume` flag is passed). This step is exactly the [§P14](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume) work, absorbed here because it's the load-bearing prerequisite for everything else in Phase A.

**Artifacts:**

- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_bridge.rs` — extend `relay_session_io`'s atomic-promote block (the lock-held section that captures `claude_session_id` from `session_init`) to also write `claude_session_id` into tugbank under `dev.tugtool.tide.session-keys`. The write happens in the same critical section as the in-memory ledger update so persistence and in-memory state can never diverge per [tide.md §P14 Step 1](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume).
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` — `do_spawn_session`'s Phase 2 tugbank write at line 1481-1486 currently emits `claude_session_id: None` always. Update so a reconnect (existing ledger entry) preserves the persisted `claude_session_id` instead of clobbering it with `None`. New ledger entries continue to write `None` until `session_init` lands and the atomic-promote block updates the record.
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` — `rebind_from_tugbank` reads `SessionKeyRecord.claude_session_id` from the tugbank blob and rehydrates the `LedgerEntry::claude_session_id` field. The `--resume` flag in the spawn args path (built around line 1517 of [tide.md §P14 Step 2](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume)) then sees `Some(id)` and threads it into `TugcodeSpawner`.
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_bridge.rs` — `TugcodeSpawner` (or its config builder) gains an optional `resume_claude_session_id` field. `spawn_session_worker` reads `entry.claude_session_id` after rebind populates it; if `Some`, the spawned tugcode subprocess gets `--resume <id>` (or an env var); if `None`, fresh spawn.
- `tugcode/src/session.ts` — replace the legacy resume-id read from the `dev.tugtool.app / session-id` singleton path (carried over from before multi-session) with a read from the new `--resume-session <id>` CLI flag (or env var) the supervisor passes on spawn. tugcode's own singleton tugbank write goes away — supervisor owns persistence ([tide.md §P14 Step 3](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume)).
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` — `do_reset_session` invalidates `claude_session_id` (tugbank delete + in-memory clear) **before** killing the subprocess so the next spawn is fresh per [tide.md §P14 Step 4](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume). `do_close_session` does **not** invalidate — a closed card can be reopened with history. **Idempotency invariant:** the invalidate-then-kill sequence treats the kill step as best-effort; if the subprocess kill fails (process already exited, signal lost, etc.), persistence is already cleared and the next spawn is fresh — there is no recovery path that re-introduces the old `claude_session_id`. A retry of `reset_session` on a partially-completed prior reset finds nothing to invalidate (already gone) and proceeds to the kill step (which is also idempotent in the supervisor's existing semantics). Net: persistence always becomes consistent with "session reset"; ledger consistency follows on next `spawn_session_ok`.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Extend `agent_bridge.rs::relay_session_io` atomic-promote block with the tugbank persistence write.
- [x] Update `do_spawn_session`'s Phase 2 record write to preserve persisted `claude_session_id` on reconnects.
- [x] Wire `rebind_from_tugbank` to read `claude_session_id` back into the rehydrated `LedgerEntry`.
- [x] Add `resume_claude_session_id` to `TugcodeSpawner` config; thread through spawn args. *Implemented as a per-call parameter on `ChildSpawner::spawn_child` (with `build_tugcode_command` appending `--resume-session <id>` when `Some`); `run_session_bridge` reads `entry.claude_session_id` before each spawn iteration and threads it through. Cleaner than per-instance state because the resume id is tied to the session, not the spawner.*
- [x] Update tugcode to read the resume id from CLI/env (drop the legacy singleton tugbank path). *No legacy singleton path existed in production tugcode (`getTugbankClient` was unused outside of test setup), so this work reduced to the canonical change: `main.ts` parses `--resume-session <id>`, threads through `SessionManager` constructor's optional fourth arg, `initialize()` prefers the persisted id over `sessionId` for the claude `--resume <id>` invocation. The synthesized `session_init` IPC line also carries the actual claude id we spawned with so tugcast's atomic-promote block doesn't briefly persist the wrong value.*
- [x] Wire `do_reset_session` to invalidate `claude_session_id` in tugbank + in-memory before subprocess restart. *Also flips `entry.session_mode` back to `New` so the next spawn is truly fresh — without this, a `Resume`-mode entry whose claude_session_id was just cleared would still tell tugcode `--session-mode resume`, and tugcode's fallback path (`resumeSessionId ?? sessionId`) would tell claude to resume the JSONL still on disk.*

**Tests:**

- [x] `test_session_init_persists_claude_session_id` — drives `relay_session_io` via duplex streams; asserts tugbank gets the write atomically with the ledger update ([tide.md §P14 Step 5](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume)).
- [x] `test_spawn_session_preserves_persisted_claude_session_id_on_reconnect` — covers the reconnect path (`!inserted` branch) by mid-life setting `entry.claude_session_id`, calling `spawn_session` again, and asserting the persisted record still carries the id. *Renamed from the plan's tentative `test_spawn_session_resumes_persisted_claude_session_id` to better describe what it actually pins (the reconnect-time preserve, not the spawn-time read).*
- [x] `test_rebind_rehydrates_claude_session_id` — asserts a fresh supervisor over a tugbank record carrying `claude_session_id: Some(...)` rebinds the entry with that id populated, so the next spawn after rebind threads `--resume-session <id>` through correctly.
- [x] `test_reset_session_clears_persisted_claude_session_id` — asserts `reset_session` deletes the claude_session_id binding before the subprocess restart.
- [x] `test_close_session_preserves_claude_session_id` — asserts a `close_session` followed by (cold-boot rebind +) `spawn_session(mode=resume)` rehydrates the persisted id. The cold-boot path is simulated by spinning up a fresh `AgentSupervisor` over the same store after the close-side dropped its supervisor.
- [x] Existing `test_close_session_deletes_tugbank_entry` flipped to `test_close_session_preserves_tugbank_entry` and `test_close_session_logs_on_tugbank_delete_failure_and_continues` flipped to `test_close_session_does_not_call_tugbank_delete` to match the new contract (close preserves; only `reset_session` deletes).
- [x] tugcode unit tests: `[P14] SessionManager resumeSessionId` describe-block covers the constructor's fourth arg (set / undefined / empty-string coercion); `[P14] main.ts --resume-session argv` covers the CLI parsing end-to-end via spawned `bun run main.ts`.
- [ ] Real-claude integration test: `test_close_then_reopen_preserves_history` — open a session, exchange a turn that establishes known context ("remember the word gazebo"), close the WebSocket, reopen, send a probe ("what word did I tell you to remember?"), assert the response contains "gazebo". Pins the resume path end-to-end. **CI gating:** matches the existing tugcast real-claude convention — `#[cfg(feature = "real-claude-tests")]` + `#[ignore]` + `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1` env gate (see `tugrust/crates/tugcast/Cargo.toml` lines 52–70 and the `multi_session_real_claude` test for the canonical pattern). Default `cargo nextest run` does not enumerate it. Local invocation: `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test -p tugcast --features real-claude-tests test_close_then_reopen_preserves_history -- --ignored`. The test lives either in the existing `multi_session_real_claude.rs` integration target or a sibling `resume_real_claude.rs` if it grows enough fixtures to warrant its own. Step 0's automated checkpoint runs the default suite; **this test is deferred to Step 5 as part of Smoke B / C verification** — Step 0 ships the plumbing and the unit tests that pin each link in the chain; the real-claude end-to-end runs once when the JSONL replay UI lands and we can observe both the Step 0 resume of Claude's own context and the Step 5 wire-side replay together.

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [x] `bun test` — green (210 tugcode tests + 2945 tugdeck tests).
- [x] `cargo nextest run` — green (1207 workspace tests, 9 skipped).

**Note:** This step ships the `--resume` plumbing without any JSONL-replay UI work. After Step 0 lands, a card that reloads will *resume Claude itself* (Claude reads its own JSONL into context), but tugdeck's transcript pane will still show empty until Step 3 — Claude has the conversation context, but the wire is silent on history. Steps 1–5 close the remaining gap.

#### Step 1: tugcode JSONL → `CODE_OUTPUT` translator (pure module) {#step-1}

**Commit:** `tugcode(replay): JSONL entry → OutboundMessage translator`

**References:** [D01] translator-location, [D06] direct-translation, [#replay-protocol]

**Artifacts:**

- New `tugcode/src/replay.ts` exporting:
  - `interface JsonlEntry` — a permissive shape covering the surveyed variants per [D06]: top-level `user`, `assistant`, `attachment`, `queue-operation`, `last-prompt`, `file-history-snapshot`, `ai-title`, `system`, `permission-mode`. Content-block types inside `message.content[]`: `text`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `thinking`, `image`. Unknown shapes are accepted at parse time and dispatched to a skip-with-telemetry path at translate time.
  - `interface TranslateContext` — per-translation state: `tug_session_id`, msg-id sequencing, the per-turn buffer (`current_msg_id`, accumulated text, accumulated `Map<tool_use_id, ToolCallState>`), and a counter of committed turns.
  - `function translateJsonlEntry(entry: JsonlEntry, ctx: TranslateContext): OutboundMessage[]` — takes one entry, returns 0..N outbound messages, mutates `ctx`'s per-turn buffer.
  - `function translateJsonlSession(jsonl: string, tugSessionId: string, opts?: { batchSize?: number }): AsyncIterable<OutboundMessage>` — top-level async iterator that lexes the JSONL line by line, drives `translateJsonlEntry`, yields outbound messages in batches per [D10]'s incremental commit policy, emits `replay_started` at the start, the synthesized `turn_complete(error)` for any orphan turn per [D08], and `replay_complete` at the end.
- Unit tests in `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay.test.ts` against fixture JSONLs — at minimum:
  - A simple two-turn session (user → assistant(end_turn) → user → assistant(end_turn)).
  - A turn with one `Bash` tool call (user → assistant(tool_use, stop_reason=tool_use) → user(tool_result) → assistant(end_turn)).
  - A turn with concurrent tool calls (multiple tool_use blocks in one assistant entry, then multiple tool_result entries before the terminal assistant).
  - A turn with `thinking` content blocks before the terminal text.
  - A turn with an `image` content block in the user submission.
  - An attachment-only entry (`hook_success`, `task_reminder`, `skill_listing`, `file`) — skipped silently.
  - A `queue-operation` / `last-prompt` / `file-history-snapshot` / `ai-title` / `system` / `permission-mode` entry — each skipped silently with telemetry.
  - An unknown top-level type — skipped via `tide::replay::unknown_shape` log.
  - An orphan turn at end-of-file (last `assistant.stop_reason: "tool_use"` or last entry is `user`) — synthesizes `turn_complete(error)` per [D08].
  - A malformed JSON line — skipped with a warning, not fatal; surrounding turns still commit.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Author the per-entry translator with explicit handling for each surveyed `type` value; unknown types log to `tide::replay::unknown_shape` and skip.
- [x] Implement the per-turn buffer + boundary detection: an `assistant` entry with `message.stop_reason: "end_turn"` triggers `turn_complete(success)`; entries with `stop_reason: "tool_use"` accumulate into the buffer.
- [x] Implement [D08]'s orphan-turn synthesis at end-of-file.
- [x] Author the session-level async iterator with batched yields per [D10].
- [x] Convert representative JSONLs into anonymized test fixtures. *Built inline in `replay.test.ts` as `JsonlEntry[]`-driven `makeJsonl(...)` builders rather than separate fixture files: the entries are small, anonymized, and live next to their assertions. A future expansion (e.g. a 1000-line stress fixture for performance regressions) can land as a real file under `__tests__/fixtures/jsonl/` without disturbing the inline tests.*
- [x] Author unit tests covering the cases above.

**Tests:**

> Step 1 tests assert the translator's `OutboundMessage[]` output shape directly — the tugdeck reducer is exercised in Step 2 and the cross-package wire integration is exercised in Step 5. No reducer is imported in `tugcode/`.
- [x] Two-turn smoke: translator output is the expected `OutboundMessage[]` sequence — for each turn: `user_message_replay`, optional intermediate `tool_use` / `tool_result` events, terminal `assistant_text(is_partial: false)`, `turn_complete(success)` carrying the turn's `msg_id` and assembled text. *Outbound shape is `user_message_replay` (not `user_message`) per the new `OutboundMessage` variant added in Step 1 — `user_message` is reserved for the inbound `tugcast → tugcode` shape; the replay echo is a distinct outbound type carrying `msg_id` so the reducer can correlate it with the upcoming `assistant_text` / `turn_complete`.*
- [x] Tool-call turn: emits `user_message_replay` + `tool_use` + `tool_result` + terminal `assistant_text(is_partial: false)` + `turn_complete(success)` in the right order.
- [x] Concurrent tools: `tool_use` and `tool_result` events interleave by `tool_use_id` correctly in insertion order ([Q02]).
- [x] Thinking content: `thinking_text(is_partial: false)` lands before the terminal `assistant_text` in the same turn.
- [x] Image content in user submission: `user_message_replay` carries the image attachment with `media_type` + base64 `content`.
- [x] Skipped shapes: `attachment` / `queue-operation` / `last-prompt` / `file-history-snapshot` / `ai-title` / `system` / `permission-mode` all produce zero outbound messages each; surrounding turns still commit; **silent** (no telemetry fires for skip-listed types — telemetry is reserved for shape-drift signals).
- [x] Unknown top-level type: produces zero outbound messages and fires `unknown_shape` telemetry with `kind: "top_level"`.
- [x] Unknown content_block type: skipped with `unknown_shape` telemetry; surrounding text content of the same entry still emits.
- [x] Orphan turn at end-of-file: synthesizes `turn_complete(error)` with accumulated text + tool_use + thinking preserved.
- [x] Bare user submission at end-of-file (no answering assistant): commits no turn; the buffer is opened by `assistant`, not `user`, so an unanswered submission lands as zero-turn replay.
- [x] Malformed JSON line: skipped; surrounding turns commit; `replay_complete` carries `error: { kind: "jsonl_malformed" }` while still counting the committed turns.
- [x] Empty JSONL: produces `replay_started` immediately followed by `replay_complete` with `count: 0` and no error.
- [x] Missing JSONL: `translateJsonlSession({ kind: "missing", message })` yields `replay_started` then `replay_complete` with `error: { kind: "jsonl_missing", ... }`; no transcript events between brackets.
- [x] Unreadable JSONL: same shape as missing, with `kind: "jsonl_unreadable"`.
- [x] Batched commit per [D10]: with `disableYield: false` and `batchSize: 2`, a `setTimeout(0)` scheduled before iteration fires mid-stream — proving the iterator yields the event loop between batches.
- [x] Direct `translateJsonlEntry` unit tests covering: user entry returns `[]`, intermediate assistant returns `[]`, terminal assistant flushes + resets ctx, unknown / missing-type telemetry, ipc_version stamping.

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0 (tugdeck typecheck still green; tugcode TS changes are additive and the existing test suite continues to typecheck).
- [x] `bun test` (in `tugcode/`) — 237 tests pass (210 prior + 27 new replay tests).
- [x] `cargo nextest run` — 1207 workspace tests pass (no Rust changes; sanity).

#### Step 2: tugdeck reducer handles `replay_started` / `replay_complete` {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): reducer handles replay bracket events`

**References:** [D04] idempotency, [D05] bracket-events, [D11] replaying-phase

**Artifacts:**

- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/events.ts` — extend the discriminated-union event type with `ReplayStartedEvent` and `ReplayCompleteEvent`.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/types.ts` — extend `CodeSessionPhase` with `"replaying"` per [D11]. Update the `canSubmit` and `canInterrupt` derivations in the snapshot builder so `replaying` excludes both.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/reducer.ts` — handle both events:
  - `replay_started`: transition `phase: {idle | errored} → replaying`. Clear `pendingUserMessage` defensively (replay should never see one). Replay must only run from `idle` or `errored` (a fresh `spawn_session_ok` for a previously-errored card transitions `errored → idle` before replay begins, so by the time `replay_started` lands the phase is `idle`; the `errored` case is an explicit invariant in case the supervisor sequences differently). `replay_started` from `submitting` / `awaiting_first_token` / `streaming` / `tool_work` / `awaiting_approval` / `replaying` is a logged warning + drop.
  - `replay_complete`: transition `phase: replaying → idle`. **Always** populate `lastReplayResult: { kind, message, count, at: Date.now() }` — `kind: "success"` with empty `message` on the no-error path, the matching error kind otherwise.
- Snapshot dedupe: `committedMsgIds: Set<string>` derived from `transcript.map(t => t.msgId)` (lazy, recomputed when transcript changes). `turn_complete` with a `msg_id` already in the set is a no-op + debug log per [D04].
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/__tests__/code-session-store.replay.test.ts` — new file covering the cases listed under Tests below.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Extend the event type union with `ReplayStartedEvent` / `ReplayCompleteEvent` / `UserMessageReplayEvent`. *Three events, not two: the per-turn user-message echo is a separate event so the reducer's existing turn-commit machinery can handle replay turns "like very fast live turns" without inventing a synthesized aggregate event.*
- [x] Extend `CodeSessionPhase` with `"replaying"`; fix exhaustiveness at consumer sites. *Only one consumer-side update was needed (`tug-prompt-entry.test.tsx`'s `defaultSnapshot()` factory) — the reducer's switch-with-default and the snapshot builder cover the rest.*
- [x] Update `canSubmit` / `canInterrupt` derivations to exclude `replaying`. *No code change needed — `canSubmit` is `phase === "idle" || phase === "errored"`, which excludes `replaying` naturally; `canInterrupt` enumerates active live phases and likewise excludes `replaying`.*
- [x] Implement the three new handlers in the reducer (`handleReplayStarted`, `handleReplayComplete`, `handleUserMessageReplay`). Plus extend the live `handleTextDelta` / `handleToolUse` / `handleToolResult` to accept `replaying` phase as an *accumulator* — they update scratch + toolCallMap but skip phase transitions and `write-inflight` effects, leaving phase entry/exit to the bracket pair. `handleTurnComplete` also branches: while `replaying`, it commits a `TurnEntry` and stays in `replaying` rather than returning to `idle` (the closing bracket is what returns to idle). `handleSend` drops while `replaying` defensively.
- [x] Add `committedMsgIds` derivation + `turn_complete` dedupe. *Lives on `CodeSessionState` directly as a `Set<string>`, populated whenever `handleTurnComplete` commits an entry. A duplicate `turn_complete` for an already-committed `msg_id` is a `console.debug`-logged no-op and does not produce a second `TurnEntry`.*
- [x] Add `lastReplayResult` snapshot field; populate on every `replay_complete` (success and error variants).
- [x] Author the new test file.

**Tests:**

- [x] Bracket round-trip: `replay_started` + 2 turns + `replay_complete` produces `phase: idle`, transcript length 2, and `lastReplayResult.kind === "success"` with `count: 2`.
- [x] Errored → replaying transition: a card whose phase is `errored` accepts `replay_started`, transitions to `replaying`, commits a turn, and lands on `idle` after `replay_complete`.
- [x] Phase exposure: between `replay_started` and `replay_complete`, `phase === "replaying"`, `canSubmit === false`, `canInterrupt === false`.
- [x] `send` while replaying: the reducer drops the action (synthetic test calls `store.send("hi")` mid-replay; asserts no CODE_INPUT frame is written, no `pendingUserMessage` set, no `queuedSends`).
- [x] Mid-turn live-frame during replay: a live `assistant_text` partial that arrives while `phase === "replaying"` accumulates in scratch but does not flip phase or touch the in-flight streaming document. *Refined wording from the original "dropped with a warn" — the cleaner contract is "accumulates without side-effects": replay's own `assistant_text` events go through the same code path, so a stray live partial would be indistinguishable from a replay event mid-window. Phase + in-flight pane stay clean either way.*
- [x] Dedupe: two `turn_complete`s with the same `msg_id` produce a transcript of length 1; the second commit is a `console.debug`-logged no-op.
- [x] Error surface: `replay_started` followed by `replay_complete` with `error: { kind: "jsonl_missing" }` produces `phase: idle`, transcript length 0, `lastReplayResult.kind === "jsonl_missing"`.
- [x] Replay timeout: `replay_complete` with `error: { kind: "replay_timeout" }` sets `lastReplayResult` (with `count` reflecting the pre-timeout commits) and lets the card become interactive.
- [x] All four error variants (`jsonl_missing`, `jsonl_unreadable`, `jsonl_malformed`, `replay_timeout`) round-trip the `kind` through the snapshot.
- [x] `lastReplayResult` lifecycle: a fresh `replay_started` clears the prior window's result back to `null`; `replay_complete` outside `replaying` is a logged no-op; `replay_started` from `submitting` is a logged no-op (live-turn protection).

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [x] `bun test` — 2957 tugdeck tests pass (2945 prior + 12 new replay tests) + 237 tugcode tests pass.
- [x] `cargo nextest run` — 1207 workspace tests pass (no Rust changes; sanity).

#### Step 3: tugcode wires replay into resume-spawn flow {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugcode(replay): emit replay before live on --session-mode resume`

**References:** [D03] replay-ordering

**Artifacts:**

- `tugcode/src/session.ts` — branch on `--session-mode` at the top of the per-session start path. **Frame-emission boundary:** tugcode owns its own IPC stdout (the pipe to tugcast); Claude owns Claude's stdout (the pipe to tugcode's stream-json reader). The "gate" is at tugcode's *IPC stdout* — tugcode emits replay-derived `OutboundMessage`s to its IPC stdout *before* it begins forwarding live events translated from Claude's stdout. Concretely:
  - `resume` mode:
    1. Locate the JSONL at `<claude_projects_root>/<encoded-project-dir>/<claude_session_id>.jsonl` (path passed in via the new `--resume-session <id>` CLI flag from Step 0; `claude_projects_root` defaults to `~/.claude/projects/` and is overridable for tests).
    2. Spawn the Claude subprocess with `--resume <claude_session_id>` so Claude internally rehydrates its context. Claude's stdout reader is created but its translated events are buffered (not yet forwarded to IPC stdout).
    3. Iterate `translateJsonlSession(...)` from Step 1; emit each yielded `OutboundMessage` to IPC stdout. The `replay_started` bracket lands first; per-turn events stream in batched flushes per [D10]; `replay_complete` lands last.
    4. Once `replay_complete` has been written to IPC stdout, drain the buffered live events from Claude's stdout reader and resume normal live forwarding.
  - `new` mode: current path; Claude spawns fresh, no replay.
- Telemetry: structured logs at `tide::replay` for `replay.started` / `replay.progress` (every batch with running count, per [D10]) / `replay.complete` / `replay.error` with timing and turn count.
- Hard-timeout enforcement: a wall-clock timer per [D10]; on expiry, abort the iterator, write `replay_complete { error: { kind: "replay_timeout", ... } }`, drop remaining JSONL lines, and resume live forwarding.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Identify the encoded-project-dir naming used by Claude (the leading `-` plus path-with-slashes-replaced-by-dashes form). Document the encoding in the module docstring.
- [x] Wire the resume branch in tugcode session start with the buffer-then-flush flow described above.
- [x] Gate live-frame *forwarding* (not Claude subprocess startup) until `replay_complete` has been written to IPC stdout.
- [x] Add the structured telemetry (`replay.started` / `replay.progress` / `replay.complete` / `replay.error`).
- [x] Implement [D10]'s hard-timeout enforcement.
- [x] If the JSONL is missing or unreadable, emit `replay_started` then `replay_complete` with `error: { kind: "jsonl_missing" | "jsonl_unreadable" }`, and proceed to live ingestion.
- [x] Bound the live-stdout buffer at a small constant (`REPLAY_LIVE_BUFFER_MAX = 1024` translated frames is more than enough — Claude on `--resume` with no new user message is essentially silent). On overflow, emit a `replay.live_buffer_overflow` warn telemetry line, stop buffering, and drain whatever was buffered after `replay_complete`. Overflow is a flag for "something pathological"; the user-visible failure mode is still safe (transcript replays; live events resume; a small live-frame slice may be dropped, recoverable via Claude's next emission). *Implementation note: tugcode does not run a continuous translation drain during replay. Because handleUserMessage is the only consumer of claude's stdout and is not invoked until after `runReplay` returns, the wire-level ordering "all replay frames precede all live frames" holds by construction. Claude's stdout sits in the OS pipe (~64 KB on Linux/macOS) during the replay window, well within bounds for the "essentially silent" `--resume` case. The constant is exported as a documented threshold; the hard-budget timeout is the ultimate safety net against a pathologically chatty claude.*
- [x] If the Claude subprocess exits *during* the replay window, abort the replay iterator, emit `replay_complete { error: { kind: "jsonl_unreadable", message: "claude_exited_during_replay" } }` (the JSONL itself is fine; the subprocess we needed to bring back online is gone), drop buffered live events, and report subprocess exit through the existing lifecycle telemetry path. The card surfaces `lastReplayResult` and stays in `idle` so the user can re-spawn manually.

**Tests:**

- [x] Tugcode-level integration test: pre-stage a fixture JSONL, start the session in resume mode against a stub Claude process, assert replay events flow on IPC stdout first, live events flow second.
- [x] Missing JSONL: resume flow still completes; the bracket pair lands with `error: { kind: "jsonl_missing" }`; live frames flow normally afterward.
- [x] Unreadable JSONL (e.g. permission denied): same as missing, with `error: { kind: "jsonl_unreadable" }`.
- [x] Hard timeout: a fixture JSONL with synthetic delay (a wrapper that throttles iteration past 10s) produces `replay_complete { error: { kind: "replay_timeout" } }` and the card-side reducer transitions to `idle`.
- [x] Buffer-then-flush ordering: live events emitted by Claude during the replay window are buffered in tugcode and forwarded to IPC stdout only after `replay_complete`; an integration test asserts the wire ordering. *Covered by construction (see implementation note above): handleUserMessage is gated until `runReplay` returns, so any live frames Claude emitted during the replay window land at IPC stdout strictly after `replay_complete`.*
- [ ] Buffer overflow: a synthetic Claude stub that emits >`REPLAY_LIVE_BUFFER_MAX` events during a slow replay produces a `replay.live_buffer_overflow` warn line; the buffered prefix is still drained after `replay_complete`; the card stays interactive. *Skipped in v1 — no continuous translation drain runs during replay, so this telemetry path doesn't exist. The hard-budget timeout covers the equivalent stuck-pipe scenario at the user-visible level.*
- [x] Claude crash mid-replay: a Claude stub that exits during the replay window produces `replay_complete { error: { kind: "jsonl_unreadable", message: "claude_exited_during_replay" } }`; the card transitions to `idle` with the populated `lastReplayResult`.

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [x] `bun test` (tugcode) — green.
- [x] `cargo nextest run` — green.

#### Step 4: Tide card "loading conversation…" UX during replay {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): TideRestoring beat for replay window`

**References:** [D10] perf-budget, [D11] replaying-phase

**Artifacts:**

- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card.tsx` — extend the `TideRestoring` placeholder to render through the replay window in addition to the binding-restore window. The Tide card observes `phase === "replaying"` (per [D11]) and selects placeholder wording:
  - **Initial state (0–2s after `replay_started`):** "Loading conversation…"
  - **Soft-budget state (>2s):** "Loading conversation… (N turns)" where N is updated from `tide::replay::progress` telemetry forwarded as a snapshot field (or, simpler for v1, a derived count from the in-progress transcript length — the reducer commits replayed turns incrementally per [D10]).
  - **Hard-budget timeout state:** when `lastReplayResult.kind === "replay_timeout"`, the placeholder briefly shows "Conversation history unavailable; resuming with empty transcript" before dismissing into the empty live transcript.
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card.css` — minor styling for the count-aware placeholder variant; otherwise no change.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Wire the `phase === "replaying"` derivation into the `TideRestoring` selector.
- [x] Implement the three placeholder copy variants (initial / soft-budget with count / hard-budget timeout).
- [x] Decide how the count surfaces — derived from `transcript.length` during replay is simplest; an explicit `replayInProgress: { count }` snapshot field is cleaner if the count needs to differ from `transcript.length`. Pick simplest that works. *Picked the simplest path: the gate reads `transcript.length` directly. Replay commits each `turn_complete` to `transcript` per [D11], so this number tracks the soft-budget count exactly.*
- [x] Verify the placeholder dismisses on `replay_complete` (success path).
- [x] Verify the timeout-state copy renders briefly then dismisses on hard-budget timeout.

**Tests:**

- [x] Component test: render the Tide card with `phase: "replaying"`; assert `TideRestoring` is mounted with the replay wording.
- [x] Component test: simulate the soft-budget state — `phase: "replaying"` for >2s with `transcript.length === 7`; assert the count "(7 turns)" appears in the placeholder.
- [x] Component test: simulate the hard-budget timeout — `replay_complete` arrives with `error: { kind: "replay_timeout" }`; assert the placeholder shows the timeout copy briefly, then dismisses to an empty live transcript with `phase: idle`.
- [x] Component test: the placeholder dismisses on `replay_complete` (success) and the transcript appears in the same render commit (no flash of empty pane).

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [x] `bun test` — green.
- [x] `bun run audit:tokens lint` — zero violations.
- [x] `cargo nextest run` — green.

#### Step 5: Tide card resume integration tests + manual smoke {#step-5}

**STATUS: SUPERSEDED.** Manual smoke verification of this step (commit `64d02cfe`) surfaced a structural gap: v1's resume design fires replay only on tugcode subprocess startup ([Step 3](#step-3)'s `runReplay`), but Smokes A (HMR), B (Reload), and D (mid-turn) all keep the tugcode subprocess alive while tugdeck rebuilds its `CodeSessionStore` from scratch — so the fresh store receives no replay events and the transcript stays empty. Smoke C (cold boot) was also reported broken; root-cause investigation moved into [Phase A-R0](#phase-a-r0). The integration tests added in this step (`tide-card-resume.test.tsx`) remain valid — they exercise the reducer-side replay vocabulary, which is unchanged. Step 5's own "Manual smoke checklist verified by user" checkpoint is deferred until [Phase A-R2](#phase-a-r2). The recovery phases [A-R0](#phase-a-r0) through [A-R4](#phase-a-r4) supersede this step's "phase done" claim.

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): resume-from-JSONL integration tests`

**References:** [#success-criteria]

**Artifacts:**

- New `tugdeck/src/__tests__/tide-card-resume.test.tsx` — drives a Tide card through:
  - Fresh mount with a stub JSONL fixture for the bound `claude_session_id`.
  - `spawn_session(mode=resume)` ack arrives.
  - Replay frames flow, transcript fills.
  - `replay_complete` lands; placeholder dismisses; transcript renders all turns.
  - User submits a new turn live; it appends correctly.
- Manual smoke checklists differentiated by transition class — these hit different code paths and need separate verification:

  **Smoke A — HMR (Vite module replacement, page stays alive).**
   - Open a Tide card; submit several turns to populate `transcript`.
   - In your editor, save a tugdeck source file (e.g. `tide-card-transcript.tsx`).
   - Vite HMR replaces the module(s); React fast-refresh remounts affected components.
   - Expected: `cardSessionBindingStore` survives in module memory (the binding module typically isn't HMR-replaced); `tide-session-restore` may or may not fire depending on which modules HMR'd. If it does fire, replay flows; if not, the existing CodeSessionStore (which survived) keeps the transcript.
   - Verify: the transcript repaints with all prior turns.
   - Verify: submit a new turn; it appends.

  **Smoke B — Developer > Reload (page destroys, app stays alive).**
   - Open a Tide card with several turns; ensure at least one terminal-state turn (`turn_complete(success)`) is on the wire.
   - Cmd-R / Developer > Reload.
   - Expected: the page tears down; tugbank rehydrates; `cardSessionBindingStore` reads its persisted record; `tide-session-restore` walks each Tide card and fires `spawn_session(mode=resume)`; replay flows; placeholder shows briefly; transcript repaints.
   - Verify: transcript content is byte-identical to pre-reload (modulo timestamp formatting).
   - Verify: submit a new turn; it appends.

  **Smoke C — Cold boot (Tug.app destroys, supervisor restarts from disk).**
   - Open a Tide card with several turns.
   - Quit Tug.app entirely.
   - Relaunch Tug.app.
   - Expected: tugcast supervisor reads its sqlite ledger + `dev.tugtool.tide.session-keys` tugbank domain; `rebind_from_tugbank` rehydrates the `LedgerEntry` with persisted `claude_session_id`; the deck restores; the active Tide card's binding record is read; `tide-session-restore` fires; replay flows.
   - Verify: transcript repaints with all prior turns.
   - Verify: submit a new turn; it appends.

  **Smoke D — Mid-turn reload (orphan turn synthesis).**
   - Open a Tide card; submit a turn that produces a long response (e.g. "summarize the last 10 commits in detail").
   - Mid-stream — while the assistant is still generating — Cmd-R / Developer > Reload.
   - Expected: replay reads the JSONL; the orphan in-flight turn synthesizes per [D08] as a `turn_complete(error)` (interrupted); the transcript shows the user's submission and whatever assistant text was captured before reload, with an interrupted marker.
   - Verify: transcript shows the orphan turn as interrupted, not as in-flight.
   - Verify: card is interactive afterward; submit a fresh turn; it appends after the interrupted one.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Author the integration test file using the existing `setup-rtl` + WASM init harness.
- [x] Add the manual smoke checklists A/B/C/D to the commit body. *Promoted to a standalone checklist at [`roadmap/tugplan-tide-transcript-resume-smoke.md`](./tugplan-tide-transcript-resume-smoke.md) so the user can drive each smoke and tick boxes inline.*
- [ ] Run all four manual smokes against a real session.

**Tests:**

- [x] Integration: resume → replay → transcript matches fixture turn count.
- [x] Integration: resume with missing JSONL → empty transcript + `lastReplayResult.kind === "jsonl_missing"` + card still functional.
- [x] Integration: orphan-turn JSONL (last `assistant.stop_reason: "tool_use"`) → transcript carries the orphan as `result: "interrupted"` per [D08].
- [x] Integration: live submit after `replay_complete` — `phase: idle`, `canSubmit: true`; new turn flows live.
- [x] Integration: live submit during replay window — `phase: replaying`, `canSubmit: false`; the prompt entry's submit button is disabled. *Implemented as the stronger contract: while `phase === "replaying"` the gate routes to the placeholder so the prompt-entry submit button is unmounted entirely. The snapshot's `canSubmit === false` and `canInterrupt === false` are asserted alongside.*

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [x] `bun test` — green.
- [x] `bun run audit:tokens lint` — zero violations.
- [x] `cargo nextest run` — green.
- [x] Manual smoke checklist verified by user. *Verified during [Phase A-R2](#phase-a-r2) on 2026-05-04 — Smokes A/B/C all pass with the new `request_replay` path through Phase A-R1.5's collapsed router gate and post-spawn-watchdog tugcode. Telemetry citations recorded inline in the [smoke checklist file](./tugplan-tide-transcript-resume-smoke.md).*

#### Phase A-R0: Diagnose Smoke C with telemetry capture {#phase-a-r0}

**Why this phase.** [Step 5](#step-5)'s manual smokes uncovered that v1's "replay fires when tugcode starts in resume mode, exactly once per subprocess lifetime" assumption is too narrow to carry the feature's user-visible promise. Smokes A (HMR), B (Reload), and D (mid-turn reload) keep tugcode alive across the user-observed event; tugdeck rebuilds its `CodeSessionStore` from scratch and receives no replay because the supervisor's `do_spawn_session` for an already-`Live` ledger entry returns `should_spawn=false`. The architectural fix lives in [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) — the `request_replay` IPC verb per [D12]. **Smoke C (cold boot)** *should* work as designed (its ledger entries rebind at `SpawnState::Idle`, so `spawn_session_worker` runs and tugcode does fire its startup-replay) but is reported broken; this phase isolates that distinct root cause before [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) ships, so the verb implementation isn't masking a separate bug.

#### Step R0a: `just tail-tugcast` recipe + replay-filtered alias {#step-r0a}

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): just tail-tugcast recipe`

**Depends on:** none (recovery entry point)

**Artifacts:**

- `Justfile` — add a `tail-tugcast` recipe alongside the existing `logs`. The new recipe is a discoverability alias (it tails the same `~/Library/Application Support/Tug/Logs/tugcast.log.<date>` file the existing `logs` recipe targets) but with a name that makes intent obvious when grepping `just --list`.
- Optional companion `tail-replay` recipe that pipes the same `tail -F` through `grep -E "tide::replay::|tide::session-lifecycle"` so a smoke run produces a focused capture without the full firehose.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add `tail-tugcast` recipe in `Justfile`. Body identical to `logs`; recipe doc-comment explains what's in scope.
- [x] Add `tail-replay` recipe that pre-greps for `tide::replay::` and `tide::session-lifecycle` log targets.
- [x] Verify both recipes run cleanly against a real launched Tug.app (they should print log lines until `Ctrl-C`). *Verified the live `tugcast.log.<today>` contains 250+ matching lines for the `tide::replay::|tide::session-lifecycle` filter from existing sessions; recipes parse and exec; `tail -F` runs until interrupted.*

**Tests:** none — Justfile recipes are infrastructure.

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `just --list` shows both recipes with their doc-comments.
- [x] `just tail-tugcast` exits cleanly on `Ctrl-C` and prints log lines as expected.
- [x] `just tail-replay` filters to the replay/lifecycle targets.

---

#### Step R0b: Capture cold-boot smoke and root-cause investigation {#step-r0b}

**Commit:** `roadmap(transcript): record Smoke C root-cause findings`

**Depends on:** [Step R0a](#step-r0a)

**Artifacts:**

- `roadmap/tugplan-tide-transcript-resume-smoke.md` — extend the existing smoke checklist with a "Smoke C diagnostic capture" appendix recording the run's observations: which `[tide::replay::]` and `[tide::session-lifecycle]` lines appeared, what the tugbank record looked like, what the rebound `LedgerEntry` carried, and what the on-disk JSONL looked like.
- A findings paragraph at the bottom of the smoke file naming the specific bug(s) that broke Smoke C.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Run a fresh Smoke C with `just tail-replay` open in a separate terminal.
- [x] Capture the following log lines in order: `[rebind.entry]`, `[spawn.effective_mode]`, `[supervisor.eager_spawn]`, `[session_init.parse]`, `[tide::replay::started]`, `[tide::replay::progress]`, `[tide::replay::complete]`, `[tide::replay::error]`.
- [x] Cross-reference with the on-disk JSONL at `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-project-dir>/<claude_session_id>.jsonl` — confirm the file exists, has the expected turn count, and the encoded path matches the binding's `projectDir`.
- [x] Cross-reference with the tugbank session-keys record for the bound card (use `tugbank` CLI or sqlite browser); confirm `claude_session_id` and `session_mode` values match what was last live.
- [x] Identify the failure mode against this candidate list:
  - **Candidate 3 confirmed**: JSONL path resolution mismatch. `tugbank.project_dir` is the symlinked path `/u/src/tugtool`; claude wrote the JSONL under the canonical encoding `-Users-<user>-Mounts-u-src-tugtool/<claude_id>.jsonl`. tugcode encoded the symlink form, found nothing, fired `replay_complete{count:0}` in 1ms.
- [x] If a one-line fix lands the candidate, file it inline as a sub-task here. If it requires the request_replay verb to land first, push it to [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) or call it a follow-on. *Fix landed inline (one line + two regression tests in `tugcode/src/session.ts` + `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn.test.ts`): `runReplay` now `await realpath(this.projectDir)` before `jsonlPathFor`. Smoke C cold boot now reaches a populated transcript — but exposes two separate bugs (Bug X — blank card with no feedback during the bind→replay wait, and Bug Y — 5–10s wall-clock from claude's `--resume` cold-start). Those move into new [Step R0c](#step-r0c) (UX placeholder) and [Step R0d](#step-r0d) (startup-order refactor).*

**Tests:** observational; no automated tests in this step. Two regression tests added in [`replay-spawn.test.ts`](../tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn.test.ts) for the `realpath` canonicalization (symlinked tmpdir + non-existent fallback).

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] Smoke C log capture appended to the smoke checklist.
- [x] Root cause(s) named explicitly.
- [x] Fix-slot decided: inline here, or pushed to [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) if it's wrapped up by the verb.

#### Step R0c: Fold replay clock into `CodeSessionStore`; consolidate banner; preflight UX (supersedes Step 4 timer pattern) {#step-r0c}

**Why this step.** Three faults must be corrected together:

1. **Step 4 design mistake** ([Step 4](#step-4), commit `64d02cfe`). The shipped `TideCardServicesGate` carries two `useEffect` timers — `softBudget` (2s soft-budget elapsed) and `timeoutGrace` (1.5s post-replay-timeout dwell) — that drive local React state (`useState` booleans) from external state changes (`phase`, `lastReplayResult`). This violates [L02] and the L24 zone boundary: the booleans are time-derived observations of structure-zone state, not local user-interaction data. They have no business living in component-local React state. **This step rips that pattern out.** No `useEffect`-driven booleans remain in `TideCardServicesGate`.

2. **Bug X** ([Step R0b](#step-r0b)). With the realpath fix in tree, cold-boot Smoke C populates the transcript — but the user sees a fully blank card body for the 5–10s while tugcode boots claude and runs replay. The card has services (binding rehydrated, `transportState === "online"`, `phase === "idle"`), and the gate routes to `TideCardBody`, which renders an empty transcript pane and the prompt entry. Replay events haven't arrived yet. There is no signal between "binding rehydrated for a resume session" and "`replay_started` landed". This step adds the missing signal.

3. **Banner pile-up risk.** `TideCardBody` already mounts two independent `<TugPaneBanner>` instances (an `error` banner from `lastError`; a `status` banner for transport reconnecting). Adding a third, independently-`visible` instance for the replay window would make three flags racing on a single portal slot — undefined visual outcome on overlap. **This step consolidates** the three into one `<TugPaneBanner>` driven by a precedence chain.

**The architecture (decided after [the R0c review](#step-r0c)):**

- **Fold replay-clock state into `CodeSessionStore`**, not a sibling store. The flags are functionally derived from the same inputs `CodeSessionStore` already owns (`phase`, `lastReplayResult`, plus a single explicit "resume binding landed" notification). The reducer's existing [D11] effect-list pattern handles "schedule a timer" cleanly as one new effect kind; the dispatch loop manages a `Map<string, TimeoutHandle>` and dispatches `tick_*` actions back to the reducer when timers expire. The reducer itself stays pure. The gate then has **one** `useSyncExternalStore` subscription against `CodeSessionStore`'s snapshot, not two.
- **Single `<TugPaneBanner>` in `TideCardBody`** driven by a `tideCardBannerSpec(snapshot, lastError)` derivation. Precedence chain: `error > transport-status > replay-status > none`. Each level renders only when higher levels aren't active; the visibility predicates are mutually exclusive by construction.
- **Preflight clears on first-of:** `phase` becomes `"replaying"`, `lastReplayResult` lands (any kind), `transportState` changes (offline / restoring takes precedence), or `REPLAY_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_MS` elapses. The 12s timer is the last-resort escape hatch, not the primary clear path.

**Commit sequence.** This step lands as four commits — small, reversible, each green at HEAD:

1. `tide(transcript): fold replay clock into CodeSessionStore`
2. `tide(transcript): rip useEffect timers from TideCardServicesGate`
3. `tide(transcript): consolidate TideCardBody banners into one derived banner`
4. `tide(transcript): switch replay-loading from backdrop to banner; add preflight beat`

**Depends on:** [Step R0b](#step-r0b)

**References:** [D04], [D10], [D11], [D12], [L02], [L10], [L22], [L24], [Step 4](#step-4) (cleanup target)

**Artifacts:**

**1. `CodeSessionStore` extension** (`tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store.ts`, `code-session-store/types.ts`, `code-session-store/reducer.ts`, `code-session-store/events.ts` — new fields, new internal events, new effect kind):

- New snapshot fields (flat — match existing `lastReplayResult` naming convention):
  ```ts
  /** True after REPLAY_SOFT_BUDGET_MS in `phase === "replaying"` without
   *  leaving. Reset when phase leaves replaying. Drives count-aware
   *  banner copy per [D10]. */
  replaySoftBudgetElapsed: boolean;
  /** True for REPLAY_TIMEOUT_DWELL_MS after phase transitions out of
   *  "replaying" while `lastReplayResult.kind === "replay_timeout"`.
   *  Drives the timeout-state banner copy. */
  replayTimeoutDwellActive: boolean;
  /** True from the moment a resume binding is acknowledged via
   *  `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` until the *first of*: phase becomes
   *  "replaying", `lastReplayResult` lands, transportState changes
   *  away from "online", or REPLAY_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_MS elapses. */
  replayPreflightActive: boolean;
  ```
- New public method on `CodeSessionStore`:
  ```ts
  /** Called by cardServicesStore at construction time when the
   *  binding's sessionMode === "resume". Dispatches a
   *  `bind_resume_acknowledged` action; the reducer flips
   *  replayPreflightActive=true and emits a `schedule_timer` effect
   *  for REPLAY_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_MS. Idempotent — re-calling is a
   *  reducer no-op once preflight has cleared. */
  notifyResumeBindingLanded(): void;
  ```
- New reducer-internal events (events.ts):
  - `bind_resume_acknowledged` — entry point for preflight.
  - `tick_soft_budget` — fires at REPLAY_SOFT_BUDGET_MS after `replay_started`.
  - `tick_timeout_dwell_done` — fires at REPLAY_TIMEOUT_DWELL_MS after dwell start.
  - `tick_preflight_done` — fires at REPLAY_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_MS after preflight start.
- New effect kind in the dispatch loop:
  - `schedule_timer { name: string; ms: number; dispatch: TimerDispatch }` — calls `setTimeout`, stores the handle in a `Map<string, TimeoutHandle>` keyed by `name`. On expiry, dispatches the named action; on a second `schedule_timer` with the same `name`, the prior is `clearTimeout`'d first.
  - `cancel_timer { name }` — clears a scheduled timer.
- Reducer state transitions affecting the new fields (additive; existing transitions unchanged):
  - On `bind_resume_acknowledged`: if `phase === "idle"` AND `replayPreflightActive === false` → set `replayPreflightActive=true`; emit `schedule_timer "preflight" REPLAY_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_MS dispatch=tick_preflight_done`.
  - On `replay_started`: clear `replayPreflightActive=false`, `replaySoftBudgetElapsed=false`; emit `cancel_timer "preflight"` and `schedule_timer "soft_budget" REPLAY_SOFT_BUDGET_MS dispatch=tick_soft_budget`.
  - On `replay_complete` (any outcome): clear `replayPreflightActive=false`; emit `cancel_timer "preflight"` and `cancel_timer "soft_budget"`. If the result is `replay_timeout`, set `replayTimeoutDwellActive=true` and emit `schedule_timer "timeout_dwell" REPLAY_TIMEOUT_DWELL_MS dispatch=tick_timeout_dwell_done`.
  - On `tick_soft_budget`: set `replaySoftBudgetElapsed=true`.
  - On `tick_timeout_dwell_done`: set `replayTimeoutDwellActive=false`.
  - On `tick_preflight_done`: set `replayPreflightActive=false`.
  - On `transport_close`: clear `replayPreflightActive=false`; emit `cancel_timer "preflight"`. (Transport-state takes precedence over preflight.)
  - On store dispose: emit `cancel_timer` for all three timer names.
- Constants exported from `code-session-store.ts`:
  ```ts
  export const REPLAY_SOFT_BUDGET_MS = 2000;
  export const REPLAY_TIMEOUT_DWELL_MS = 1500;
  export const REPLAY_PREFLIGHT_TIMEOUT_MS = 12_000;
  ```
- Snapshot identity stays `Object.is`-stable across no-op dispatches (existing memoization contract is unchanged; new fields participate in the same equality check).

**2. `cardServicesStore`** (`tugdeck/src/lib/card-services-store.ts`):

- After `CodeSessionStore` construction in `_construct`, if `binding.sessionMode === "resume"`, call `codeSessionStore.notifyResumeBindingLanded()`. This is the single explicit signal — `CodeSessionStore` does not subscribe to `cardSessionBindingStore` itself.
- No subscription teardown needed; the existing `_dispose` path handles `CodeSessionStore.dispose()` which cancels its timers.

**3. `TideCardServicesGate`** (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card.tsx`):

- **Delete** `useState` for `softBudget` / `timeoutGrace`, both `useEffect` blocks, and `prevPhaseRef`. The gate has no local timer state.
- Existing `useSyncExternalStore` subscriptions for `phase` / `transportState` / `lastReplayResult` / `transcript.length` / `projectDir` stay. The new fields (`replayPreflightActive`, `replaySoftBudgetElapsed`, `replayTimeoutDwellActive`) ride the same snapshot.
- Routing precedence (top to bottom):
  1. `transportState === "restoring"` → `TideRestoring variant="binding"` (full-card backdrop, unchanged).
  2. Otherwise, render `TideCardBody`. The body decides banner visibility from the same snapshot.

**4. `TideCardBody` banner consolidation** (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card.tsx`):

- Replace the three independent `<TugPaneBanner>` instances with **one** `<TugPaneBanner>` whose `(visible, variant, tone, label, message, ...)` are derived from the snapshot via a pure helper:
  ```ts
  type TideCardBannerSpec =
    | { kind: "none" }
    | { kind: "error"; cause: LastErrorCause; message: string; ... }
    | { kind: "transport"; state: "offline" | "restoring"; ... }
    | { kind: "replay-loading"; turnsCount: number | null }
    | { kind: "replay-timeout" };

  function deriveTideCardBannerSpec(snap: CodeSessionSnapshot): TideCardBannerSpec {
    // Precedence chain, mutually exclusive by construction:
    if (snap.lastError) return { kind: "error", ... };
    if (snap.transportState !== "online") return { kind: "transport", ... };
    if (snap.replayTimeoutDwellActive) return { kind: "replay-timeout" };
    if (snap.phase === "replaying") {
      return {
        kind: "replay-loading",
        turnsCount: snap.replaySoftBudgetElapsed ? snap.transcript.length : null,
      };
    }
    if (snap.replayPreflightActive) {
      return { kind: "replay-loading", turnsCount: null };
    }
    return { kind: "none" };
  }
  ```
- The single `<TugPaneBanner>` reads the spec and maps to props. Existing error-banner UI (footer with Reset button, detail panel with `children`) stays — error spec carries those fields. Transport status renders strip-only. Replay variants render strip-only with the documented copy.
- Replay banner copy (banner is `variant="status"`, `tone="default"` for replay-loading, `tone="caution"` for replay-timeout):
  - `replay-loading` with `turnsCount === null` → "Loading conversation…"
  - `replay-loading` with `turnsCount > 0` → `Loading conversation… (${turnsCount} ${turnsCount === 1 ? "turn" : "turns"})`
  - `replay-timeout` → "Conversation history unavailable; resuming with empty transcript"

**5. `TideRestoring`** (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card.tsx`):

- Remove the `replay-loading` and `replay-timeout` variants from the discriminated union. Only `binding` remains — a full-card backdrop for the transport-restore beat (the user can Cancel and drop to the picker). The replay window no longer uses `TideRestoring` at all.

**Notes on previously-noted holes** (audit findings carried through):

- *Hole #1 — `TugPaneBanner` portals.* The single banner in `TideCardBody` is rendered as a child of the body subtree; `TugPaneBanner` internally `createPortal`s into the pane chrome's banner slot. The body decides visibility; the banner appears under the title bar. This is the existing pattern for the error and transport banners — not a new mechanic.
- *Hole #3 — `inert` semantics during banner display.* `TugPaneBanner` applies `inert` to `.tug-pane-body` while visible; user can see the banner and the populating transcript but cannot type into the prompt entry. Acceptable for replay (canSubmit is `false` during replaying anyway). For the preflight beat, the body is also inert — the user cannot pre-stage a message during the wait. Documented limitation; not load-bearing.
- *Hole #4 — preflight is signaled, not observed.* `CodeSessionStore` does not subscribe to `cardSessionBindingStore`. Instead, `cardServicesStore` is the single point that knows "this binding is resume-mode, just constructed" and explicitly calls `notifyResumeBindingLanded()`. Avoids dual-subscriber coordination bugs.
- *Hole #7 — three-commit ordering.* The four-commit sequence above resolves the awkward intermediate state of the prior plan: commits 1 and 2 preserve user-visible behavior (variants still rendered as backdrops); commit 3 consolidates banner architecture without functional change; commit 4 swaps backdrops for banner + adds preflight. Each commit is independently green; revert is surgical.
- *Hole #8 — `TideRestoring(binding)` stays a backdrop.* Deliberate. Binding-restore is a hard-stop beat (the wire is being re-asserted; user can Cancel and drop to picker). Replay is informational (transcript fills behind the banner). Two operations, two visual weights — justified by the different stakes, not by accident.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Commit 1 — fold replay clock into `CodeSessionStore`:**
  - [x] Add the three new snapshot fields with default values (`false` each); thread through `getSnapshot` memoization.
  - [x] Add the three new internal events (`bind_resume_acknowledged`, `tick_soft_budget`, `tick_timeout_dwell_done`, `tick_preflight_done`) to the reducer's event union.
  - [x] Add the new effect kinds (`schedule_timer`, `cancel_timer`); extend the dispatch loop to manage the `Map<string, TimeoutHandle>`.
  - [x] Implement reducer transitions per the spec above (preflight, replay_started, replay_complete, ticks, transport_close, dispose).
  - [x] Add `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` public method.
  - [x] Update `cardServicesStore._construct` to call `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` for resume bindings.
  - [x] Tests in `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/__tests__/code-session-store.replay-clock.test.ts` (NEW): each new field's lifecycle, snapshot identity stability, dispose cancels timers, transport_close clears preflight.
  - [x] All existing CodeSessionStore tests stay green (no new test breaks; the new fields are additive).
- [x] **Commit 2 — gate uses store fields:**
  - [x] Delete `useState` (`softBudget`, `timeoutGrace`), `useEffect` blocks, and `prevPhaseRef` from `TideCardServicesGate`.
  - [x] Read the three new fields off the existing snapshot via the existing `useSyncExternalStore` pattern.
  - [x] Existing tests in `tide-card-replay-placeholder.test.tsx` continue to pass — rendering behavior preserved (variants still rendered).
  - [x] Grep `tide-card.tsx` gate scope for `useEffect` / `useState`: zero hits attributable to Step 4.
- [x] **Commit 3 — consolidate banners in `TideCardBody`:**
  - [x] Author `deriveTideCardBannerSpec(snap)` as a pure helper alongside `TideCardBody`.
  - [x] Replace the two existing `<TugPaneBanner>` instances with one driven by the spec; ensure the precedence chain `error > transport > replay-timeout > replay-loading > none` produces the same UI for currently-exercised cases.
  - [x] Existing tests for the error banner and the transport-state banner (`tide-card-transport-state.test.tsx`, `tide-card-last-error.test.tsx`) pass with no behavioral change.
  - [x] Add unit tests for `deriveTideCardBannerSpec` covering each precedence-chain branch.
- [x] **Commit 4 — banner replaces backdrop for replay; add preflight beat:**
  - [x] Add `replay-loading` and `replay-timeout` cases to `deriveTideCardBannerSpec`.
  - [x] Remove the `replay-loading` and `replay-timeout` variants from `TideRestoring`'s discriminated union.
  - [x] Update the gate so the only remaining `TideRestoring` consumer is the `transportState === "restoring"` branch (binding variant).
  - [x] Delete `tide-card-replay-placeholder.test.tsx` and `tide-card-resume.test.tsx` (per the happy-dom scoping rule, RTL renders that exercise event ordering across React renders are forbidden — coverage is split: pure store lifecycle in `code-session-store.replay-clock.test.ts`, pure derivation in `tide-card-banner-spec.test.ts`, and the user's manual cold-boot smoke).
  - [ ] Manual cold-boot smoke confirms the full beat: card mounts → banner shows preflight copy → replay events flow → banner copy transitions through soft-budget if applicable → banner dismisses on `replay_complete` → transcript fully visible.

**Tests:**

- [x] `code-session-store.replay-clock.test.ts` (NEW):
  - [x] `replaySoftBudgetElapsed` flips true 2s after `replay_started`; clears on next `replay_started` or on `replay_complete`.
  - [x] `replayTimeoutDwellActive` flips true on `replay_complete{replay_timeout}`; clears 1.5s later via tick.
  - [x] `replayTimeoutDwellActive` does NOT fire for non-timeout replay errors.
  - [x] `replayPreflightActive` flips true on `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` from idle; clears on `replay_started`, on `replay_complete`, on `transport_close`, and on the 12s tick — whichever fires first.
  - [x] Calling `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` while preflight is already active is a reducer no-op (no second timer scheduled).
  - [x] Calling `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` while not idle (e.g. mid-replay) is a no-op.
  - [x] Snapshot identity is `Object.is`-stable when no replay-clock field changes.
  - [x] Store `dispose()` cancels all in-flight timers; subsequent listener notifications never fire.
- [x] `deriveTideCardBannerSpec.test.ts` (NEW): one test per precedence-chain branch + the no-banner case.
- [x] `tide-card-replay-placeholder.test.tsx` and `tide-card-resume.test.tsx` (DELETED): both were RTL renders exercising banner mount/dismiss across React renders, which the happy-dom scoping rule forbids. Replay-clock and derivation are now covered by the two pure-logic suites above; cross-render behavior is verified by the manual cold-boot smoke listed under the Checkpoint section below.
- [x] `tide-card-transport-state.test.tsx` (existing): unchanged behavior — confirms the transport status banner still works after consolidation.
- [x] `tide-card-last-error.test.tsx` (existing): unchanged behavior — confirms the error banner still works after consolidation.

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01** — One `root.render()`. Render output of `TideCardBody` changes (one banner instead of two, plus replay cases) but no new mount points. ✓
- **L02** — *External state enters React through `useSyncExternalStore` only. No `useEffect` copying external values into React state.* This step is the corrective for the Step 4 violation: zero `useEffect`-driven booleans remain in `TideCardServicesGate`. The replay-clock state lives entirely inside `CodeSessionStore` and reaches React through the existing snapshot-subscribe path. ✓
- **L03** — `useLayoutEffect` for event-dependent registrations. N/A — no event handlers added. ✓
- **L06** — Appearance via CSS / DOM. Banner enter/exit is owned by `TugPaneBanner` (TugAnimator + CSS keyframes per its existing implementation, [L13–L14]-compliant). Banner copy is structural data — flows through render normally per L06's data-vs-appearance test. ✓
- **L09** — Pane composes chrome; cards supply content. `TugPaneBanner` is content-side composition that portals into pane chrome's banner slot — the existing pattern. ✓
- **L10** — One responsibility per layer. **`CodeSessionStore` already owns the inputs (`phase`, `lastReplayResult`); folding the time-derived flags into the same store keeps the responsibility cohesive.** Choosing this over a sibling store was a deliberate architectural decision (see "the architecture" above) — sibling-store would have split the responsibility unnecessarily. ✓
- **L11** — Controls emit, responders own state. `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` is a public method, not a React-level action — `cardServicesStore` calls it directly outside React's render cycle. No new actions; no new responders. ✓
- **L13–L14** — TugAnimator + CSS keyframes. `TugPaneBanner` is unchanged; the banner consolidation reuses its existing motion contract. ✓
- **L19** — Component authoring guide. New tests, new helper, new docstrings; existing component contracts untouched. ✓
- **L20** — Token sovereignty. `TugPaneBanner`'s tokens are unaffected. ✓
- **L22** — *When external state drives DOM updates, observe the store directly.* Exactly the law this satisfies. The replay-clock derivations live in the store; React reads them via `useSyncExternalStore`. The Step 4 `useEffect` pattern was the L22 anti-pattern. ✓
- **L23** — User-visible state preserved. Transcript, focus, scroll, prompt-entry draft, `lastError` banner content — all owned by deeper components / stores and untouched by this refactor. The gate-level routing decision still respects [L23] for transport-restoring (full backdrop with Cancel) and idle-with-replay-pending (banner above interactive body). ✓
- **L24** — State zones. Replay-clock fields are structure-zone state (subscribed via `useSyncExternalStore`). Banner copy is appearance-zone consequence (CSS / DOM). No local-data-zone leakage. The corrective named in this step (folding the timers into the store, deleting the gate's `useState`) is exactly an L24 cleanup. ✓

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` exit 0 after each of the four commits.
- [x] `bun test` (tugdeck) green after each commit for `code-session-store.replay-clock.test.ts`, `deriveTideCardBannerSpec.test.ts`, `tide-card-transport-state.test.tsx`, `tide-card-last-error.test.tsx`.
- [x] `bun run audit:tokens lint` zero violations.
- [ ] Manual cold-boot smoke shows the banner during the wait, transitions through soft-budget count when applicable, and dismisses cleanly to the populated transcript.
- [x] Grep `tide-card.tsx` for `useEffect` / `useState` introduced by [Step 4](#step-4): zero hits.

#### Step R0d: tugcode startup-order refactor — replay before claude spawn (resume mode only) {#step-r0d}

> **Partial supersession (Phase A-R1.5 + Phase A-R4).** Two of this step's mechanisms have since been changed:
>
> 1. The 30s `SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS` watchdog this step introduced is removed in [Step R1d](#step-r1d). The watchdog's stated proxy ("claude is alive") cannot be observed at startup (claude in stream-json mode emits nothing on stdout until it receives input), so its actual semantic was "user idle for 30s" — which Smoke B exposed as a false-positive that killed healthy claudes. See [Phase A-R1.5](#phase-a-r1-5) for the diagnosis and [Step R1d](#step-r1d) for the removal.
> 2. The direct `runReplay()` invocation from `main.ts`'s cold-boot resume branch is removed in [Step R4](#step-r4). Replay is now request-driven only — the `request_replay` verb is the single trigger. The supervisor queues the verb during the Spawning window and drains it on Spawning→Live promotion, so cold-boot replay arrives at the same wire timing as before. See [Phase A-R4](#phase-a-r4) for the diagnosis and [Step R4](#step-r4) for the collapse.
>
> The startup-order refactor *itself* (prepareSession synthesizing session_init early so tugcast can promote Spawning→Live before claude finishes loading) stays — that part of R0d remains the load-bearing fix for the cold-boot speed problem.

**Why this step.** [Step R0b](#step-r0b)'s smoke exposed Bug Y: the 5–10s cold-boot wait on resume is dominated by claude's `--resume` binary load. Today tugcode's `main.ts` runs:

```
await sessionManager.initialize();   // spawns claude (~5s)
await sessionManager.runReplay();    // reads JSONL (~50ms)
```

The two awaits are sequential, but they're not actually dependent: replay only needs the JSONL on disk, not a live claude process. Reordering the resume path so replay runs before the spawn lets the populated transcript appear within ~100ms of card mount, while claude finishes loading in the background and is ready by the time the user submits their first new turn. Combined with [Step R0c](#step-r0c)'s preflight banner — which now bridges a ~100ms gap instead of a 5–10s one — and [Step R0c](#step-r0c)'s synthetic `system_metadata` at the top of replay, the resumed transcript renders fully attributed (model name, badges) without claude needing to be alive yet.

**Scope: resume mode only.** This refactor changes behavior exclusively for `sessionMode === "resume"`. New-mode spawns retain the current "spawn claude → emit session_init → IPC loop" sequence: there's no JSONL to replay, no claude id to forward early, and no user-perceived dead window to fix. Branching on `sessionMode` keeps the new-mode happy path untouched and minimizes surface area.

**Wire-semantic shift to call out.** Today, `spawn_session_ok` arrives only after claude has actually started up — so a tugdeck client treating `spawn_session_ok` as proof of "claude is alive" works by accident. Post-R0d, tugcode emits the synthetic `session_init` early (with the resume's persisted `claude_session_id`); the supervisor sees the session as live and broadcasts `spawn_session_ok` while claude is still spawning in the background. The new contract: **`spawn_session_ok` means "tugcode has accepted ownership of this session id," not "claude is alive on the other side."** In normal flow this is invisible — the spawn promise resolves long before any user submit — but it's a real semantic shift that future work should not silently rely on. Documented here so it doesn't surprise anyone later.

**Failure-path UX trade-off.** With the new order, a `resume_failed` outcome surfaces *after* the user has already seen the populated transcript: replay completes (~100ms), then claude fails to spawn (a few seconds later), then the card observer routes `resume_failed` to the picker, which drops in over the populated transcript. Pre-R0d the same failure went straight from the binding-restore backdrop to the picker — no visible transcript. We accept this trade-off: the success path is an order of magnitude faster, the failure path is rare (a stale id or a binary problem), and the picker's "couldn't restore" notice carries the explanation. Worth flagging because it *is* a regression on the failure path, just one we're choosing.

**Commit:** `tugcode(replay): run replay before spawning claude on cold-boot resume`

**Depends on:** [Step R0c](#step-r0c)

**References:** [D03], [D08], [D10]

**Artifacts:**

- `tugcode/src/session.ts` — split `initialize()` into two responsibilities, gated on session mode:
  - **Pre-spawn synchronous work** (`prepareSession()` or inline at the call site): emit the synthetic `session_init` IPC carrying the resume's persisted `claude_session_id`, wire up the stderr classification placeholder, but don't spawn claude yet. Runs only on resume mode.
  - **Async claude spawn** (`spawnClaudeAndWatch()`): spawn claude with `--resume <claude_id>`, install the early-exit watcher and stderr reader, and return a Promise the caller can `await` later. Runs on both modes; new mode keeps spawning eagerly inside `initialize()` as today.
- `tugcode/src/main.ts` — new startup order on `protocol_init` for resume mode only:
  1. `prepareSession()` — emits the synthetic `session_init` immediately.
  2. `runReplay()` — reads the JSONL and emits replay events; flows in ~50ms with no claude bootup blocking it.
  3. `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` — spawns claude in the background. The returned Promise is stored on `SessionManager` (e.g., `claudeReadyPromise`) and `handleUserMessage` awaits it before forwarding any `user_message` to claude's stdin.
  4. IPC loop runs as before.
- **Spawn timeout.** `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` arms a hard timeout (recommended: ~30s) on the spawn-and-init handshake. If claude hasn't emitted its real `system_init` by then, the watcher fires `resume_failed` with a `spawn_timeout` reason. Without this, a hung claude leaves the user submitting into a black hole — pre-R0d the same hang surfaced as "Loading conversation…" forever, which was at least honest. The R0c card observer already routes `resume_failed` to the picker, so no new failure plumbing is needed; we just need a real fault to fire.
- **`runReplay()` and the claude-exit race.** Pre-R0d, `runReplay()` raced its hard-budget timer against `claudeProcess.exited` to detect a crash mid-replay. In the new cold-boot order, claude isn't spawned yet when replay runs — `claudeProcess` is `null` and the exit branch is omitted. Crash-during-replay protection moves entirely to the [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) `request_replay` path, which runs against an already-live claude; cold-boot replay needs only the hard-budget timer.
- **Resume-failure handling.** Unchanged plumbing: the existing watcher catches resume failures (`resume_failed`, `collision`) and emits the right IPC, which tugcast surfaces as `session_state_errored`. The R0c card observer reads `lastError.cause === "resume_failed"`, clears the binding, and routes the user to the picker with a notice. The only new contributor is the spawn-timeout branch above.
- **Mid-turn / Smoke D.** Out of scope here; [Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3) handles `request_replay` during a live turn. With the new resume-mode order, cold boot is genuinely "replay first, claude second" — orphan-turn synthesis at end-of-JSONL is unaffected by claude's bootup state.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Refactor `SessionManager.initialize()` into `prepareSession()` + `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` (or equivalent shape). The split must not change the wire bytes of the synthetic `session_init` for resume mode — same fields, same `claude_session_id` value (the persisted resume id), same shape.
- [x] Branch on `sessionMode === "resume"` at the call site in `main.ts`. Resume runs `prepareSession()` → `runReplay()` → `spawnClaudeAndWatch()`; new mode runs `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` directly (the historical eager path). Both paths converge on the IPC loop.
- [x] Store the spawn Promise on `SessionManager` (e.g., `this.claudeReadyPromise`). `handleUserMessage` awaits it before any claude stdin write — the very first user submit on resume blocks until claude is up; subsequent submits land instantly.
- [x] Add the spawn timeout. Recommended ~30s hard-fault threshold on the resume `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` path. On expiry, fire `resume_failed` with `reason="spawn_timeout"`. New-mode spawn paths inherit whatever timeout they have today; the new timeout is resume-specific.
- [x] Update `runReplay()` so the claude-exit race is conditional: when `claudeProcess` is null (cold-boot resume order), only the hard-budget timer applies. The crash-during-replay branch lives only on the request_replay path going forward.
- [x] Existing tests in `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn.test.ts` that primed a mock subprocess via `initialize()` continue to pass unchanged: `initialize()` now composes `prepareSession()` + `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` internally, preserving wire bytes and observable behavior. No mock-subprocess plumbing rewrite needed.
- [x] Add a cold-boot ordering test: `prepareSession()` → `runReplay()` emits the bracket pair plus per-turn events on IPC stdout *before* a delayed mock `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` resolves. Assert: synthetic `session_init` precedes any frame the mock claude would have routed.
- [x] Add a "spawn-fails-after-replay-succeeds" test: mock `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` to fail (e.g., immediate exit-code-1) after a clean `runReplay()`. Assert the wire emits replay bracket pair + per-turn events first, then `resume_failed` + `session_state_errored`. This is the new failure mode introduced by the refactor; the test is what locks in the deliberate UX trade-off described above.
- [x] Add a "spawn-times-out" test: mock claude to never emit `system_init`; advance clocks to 30s; assert the spawn watcher fires `resume_failed` with `reason="spawn_timeout"`.
- [x] Telemetry: keep the existing `[tide::replay::started|complete]` lines; add `[tide::session-lifecycle event=tugcode.spawn_claude_async]` at the moment `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` kicks off, and `[tide::session-lifecycle event=tugcode.spawn_timeout]` if the new timeout fires. A smoke can grep for the spawn_async marker to confirm ordering in production. (Also adds `tugcode.prepare_session` for parity with the synthetic-init emission.)

**Tests:**

- [x] All existing `replay-spawn.test.ts` tests pass with the new ordering (they exercise the post-replay path; only the mock-subprocess plumbing shifts to the new spawn function).
- [x] New: deterministic ordering — `runReplay` finishes before `spawnClaudeAndWatch` resolves, given a delayed mock claude.
- [x] New: cold-boot integration — synthetic `session_init` lands on IPC stdout before any claude-routed stream-json event.
- [x] New: spawn-fails-after-replay — replay events flow, then `resume_failed` lands; existing post-failure plumbing (card observer → picker) unaffected.
- [x] New: spawn-times-out — 30s hang on claude triggers `resume_failed{reason:"spawn_timeout"}` rather than leaving the session in limbo.
- [x] New: spawn-times-out is suppressed once `handleUserMessage` runs (claudeReceivedInput disarms the timer).
- [x] Existing: `handleUserMessage` awaits the spawn promise before the first claude stdin write — exercises the Promise-coordination seam directly.

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01–L25** — Not applicable in the strict sense. This step lives entirely inside the tugcode bridge subprocess; tuglaws govern the tugways/tugdeck React UI. There's no rendering, no DOM, no React state machinery to satisfy or violate here.
- **L23 cross-cut.** User-visible state — the transcript — flows downstream through the same IPC wire as before; the refactor changes *when* replay events appear, not *whether* they do or *what* they carry. The synthetic `session_init` is bytes-identical to claude's real one for the resume case (same `claude_session_id`, same shape), so tugdeck consumers (`SessionMetadataStore`, `CodeSessionStore`'s lifecycle log) see no semantic change. ✓

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` exit 0.
- [x] `bun test` (tugcode) green: 260 pass / 0 fail (was 254; +5 new R0d cases + 1 spawn-timeout-disarm case).
- [x] `cargo nextest run` green: 1207 passed / 9 skipped.
- [ ] Manual cold-boot smoke: on resume, the transcript paints within ~1s of card mount (down from 5–10s); claude finishes its spawn in the background; the first new submit lands without an additional wait. New mode still spawns eagerly with no observable change.

#### Phase A-R1: `request_replay` IPC verb across all three layers {#phase-a-r1}

**Why this phase.** Per [D12]: tugdeck dispatches a CONTROL `request_replay` frame whenever it constructs services for a resume binding; tugcast forwards the verb to tugcode's stdin; tugcode invokes its existing `runReplay()` method. Idempotent at the reducer level via [D04] msg_id dedupe. Closes the gap exposed by Smokes A and B without touching session lifecycle. (Phase A-R4 subsequently collapsed the dual-trigger arrangement — startup-replay was removed and the verb became the single trigger.)

#### Step R1a: tugcode handles inbound `request_replay` {#step-r1a}

**Commit:** `tugcode(replay): handle request_replay inbound verb`

**Depends on:** [Step R0d](#step-r0d)

**References:** [D12]

**Artifacts:**

- `tugcode/src/types.ts` — new `RequestReplay` inbound type, type guard `isRequestReplay`, registered in the `InboundMessage` discriminated union.
- `tugcode/src/main.ts` — IPC dispatch branch: `isRequestReplay(msg)` → fire-and-forget `sessionManager.runReplay()` (do not block the IPC loop on it).
- `tugcode/src/session.ts` — make `runReplay`'s `replayActive` flag a re-entrancy guard. If a request arrives while replay is in flight, drop with a `tide::replay::request_dropped` warn telemetry line (the original replay's events satisfy the request).

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add `RequestReplay` to `InboundMessage` discriminated union and `isInboundMessage` type-guard table.
- [x] Add `isRequestReplay` type guard.
- [x] Wire dispatch in `main.ts` after the existing `isInterrupt` / `isPermissionMode` branches; structure as fire-and-forget so replay's iteration doesn't block subsequent IPC reads.
- [x] Add a `tide::replay::request` info telemetry line when the verb is received and accepted, plus `tide::replay::request_dropped` when it's rejected by the re-entrancy guard.
- [x] Make `runReplay` re-entrancy-safe: if `replayActive` is true at entry, log + return immediately.

**Tests:**

- [x] Inbound type guard accepts `{type:"request_replay"}` and rejects malformed shapes.
- [x] `SessionManager.runReplay()` is callable multiple times in sequence; each call emits a complete `replay_started`/`replay_complete` bracket.
- [x] Re-entrancy: a second `runReplay()` started while the first is in flight is dropped (no overlap on IPC stdout); the `request_dropped` telemetry line is emitted.
- [x] Integration: send `request_replay` over the IPC loop to a primed `SessionManager`; assert replay events flow and the IPC loop accepts subsequent messages. *Coverage shape: scoped to the `SessionManager` boundary the dispatch branch in `main.ts` calls (a single one-line `runReplay()` invocation behind a type guard). The two sequential-callability tests + re-entrancy test together exercise "replay events flow" (bracket pair) and "subsequent messages still accepted" (the second call lands cleanly). Full subprocess wire-level coverage moves to [Step R1b](#step-r1b) where the rust supervisor's test child-spawner mock is the right unit.*

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01–L25** — N/A. tugcode bridge subprocess; no React. Same posture as [Step R0d](#step-r0d).
- **L23** considered explicitly: re-entrancy guard prevents overlapping replay output on IPC stdout, which would otherwise produce out-of-order frames at tugdeck and risk corrupting transcript state. Dropping a redundant request is safe because the in-flight replay's events satisfy the request. ✓

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun test` (tugcode) — green. *265 tests pass (260 baseline + 5 new: 2 type-guard + 3 runReplay sequential/re-entrancy).*

#### Step R1b: tugcast forwards `request_replay` to tugcode stdin {#step-r1b}

**Commit:** `tugcast(replay): forward request_replay CONTROL action to tugcode`

**Depends on:** [Step R1a](#step-r1a)

**References:** [D12]

**Artifacts:**

- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` — extend the CONTROL frame handler (alongside `spawn_session`, `close_session`, etc.) to recognize `action == "request_replay"`. Body looks up the ledger entry; if `spawn_state == Live`, write `{"type":"request_replay"}\n` to tugcode's stdin via the existing per-session `input_tx` channel. If `spawn_state` is not Live (Idle, Spawning, Errored, Closed), no-op with a `tide::session-lifecycle event=request_replay.skipped` log line.
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_bridge.rs` — minor; the new frame rides the existing per-session `input_tx` queue, so the bridge needs no behavior change beyond a recognized payload landing on the existing path.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Define the wire shape: CONTROL frame `{ "action": "request_replay", "tug_session_id": "<id>" }`. Document in the supervisor's CONTROL action enumeration comments.
- [x] Extend the supervisor's CONTROL handler (`handle_control` switch on `action`) to recognize `"request_replay"`. Reject payloads without `tug_session_id` with `ControlError::MissingSessionId`. *Note: `MissingSessionId` is the existing variant the parser layer uses for the same shape ([`parse_control_payload_owned`] returns it for the spawn/close payload). The plan's earlier `InvalidPayload` reference was abstract; the right variant for this wire-side condition is `MissingSessionId`.*
- [x] Look up ledger entry; if `Live`, send `{"type":"request_replay"}` Frame to `input_tx`. If not Live, skip + log.
- [x] Add structured `tide::session-lifecycle event=request_replay.dispatched` log line on the success path; `event=request_replay.skipped` on the no-op branches with a `reason` field naming the spawn_state (`unknown`, `idle`, `spawning`, `errored`, `closed`, `no_input_tx`).
- [x] Tests: control_request_replay frame for a Live session → tugcode child mock observes `{"type":"request_replay"}` on its stdin.
- [x] Tests: control_request_replay frame for an Idle session → no stdin write, no error frame, log line matches.

**Tests:**

- [x] CONTROL `request_replay` for a Live session writes the JSON-line to tugcode's stdin (use the existing test child-spawner mock). *Asserts the frame lands on the captured `input_tx` mpsc — the same channel the bridge's input loop reads and writes verbatim to tugcode's stdin. Spinning a real bridge here would test agent_bridge.rs, not the supervisor; the boundary is the supervisor's contribution.*
- [x] CONTROL `request_replay` for an Idle / unknown / Closed session is a no-op + logged.
- [x] CONTROL `request_replay` with a missing `tug_session_id` returns a `ControlError` and logs. Plus malformed-JSON and empty-string variants for parser-edge coverage.

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01–L25** — N/A. Rust supervisor (tugcast). Tuglaws govern tugways/tugdeck React UI. No React, no DOM, no rendering.
- The bridge code follows the supervisor's existing CONTROL action conventions (Q01, [D03] / [D12]); architectural integrity is governed there, not by tuglaws.

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `cargo nextest run` (tugcast) — green. *513 tests pass (506 baseline + 7 new R1b: live forwards, idle/closed/unknown noop, missing/empty/malformed payload errors). Workspace-wide 1214 pass; `cargo clippy -D warnings` and `cargo fmt --check` clean.*

---

#### Step R1c: tugdeck dispatches `request_replay` on services construction {#step-r1c}

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): dispatch request_replay on services bind`

**Depends on:** [Step R1b](#step-r1b)

**References:** [D12]

**Artifacts:**

- `tugdeck/src/lib/session-lifecycle.ts` — new helper `sendRequestReplay(tugSessionId)` that emits a CONTROL frame with `{action: "request_replay", tug_session_id}`. Mirrors the existing `sendSpawnSession` / `sendCloseSession` pattern.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/card-services-store.ts` — at the end of `_construct`, after services are wired and the `CodeSessionStore` subscribes to CODE_OUTPUT, dispatch `sendRequestReplay(binding.tugSessionId)` iff `binding.sessionMode === "resume"` and `getConnection()` is online. The fresh `CodeSessionStore` will subscribe before this dispatch's reply arrives, so no race against the inbound replay frames.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store.ts` — already handles `replay_started` / `replay_complete` / `turn_complete` events idempotently per [D04]; no reducer change.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Add `sendRequestReplay` helper with a clear docstring naming [D12].
- [x] Wire dispatch in `cardServicesStore._construct` after the services bag is constructed and before the function returns. *Folded into the existing `if (binding.sessionMode === "resume")` block right after `notifyResumeBindingLanded()` so the preflight banner and the wire dispatch live side-by-side and share the same gate.*
- [x] Gate dispatch on `binding.sessionMode === "resume"`. Document why fresh-spawn bindings don't need it (no JSONL exists yet for a fresh-spawn until claude writes its first turn).
- [x] Gate dispatch on `getConnection()` non-null so test harnesses without a wire don't try to send. *Implicit: `_construct` early-returns null at line ~191 if `getConnection()` is null; the dispatch site is downstream of that guard, so a null connection cannot reach it.*
- [x] Add a structured `tide::session-lifecycle event=request_replay.dispatch` log line for end-to-end observability. *Emitted inside `sendRequestReplay` via `logSessionLifecycle("request_replay.dispatch", { tug_session_id })`.*
- [x] Component test: render a Tide card; setBinding with `sessionMode: "resume"`; assert the test connection observed a CONTROL frame with `action=request_replay` and the right `tug_session_id`. *Scope-adjusted to a `cardServicesStore`-driven integration test (`card-services-store-request-replay.test.ts`) following the established `tide-session-restore-transport-settled.test.ts` pattern: mocks for connection / lifecycle / tugbank / settings-api singletons, drive `_construct` through `attachDeckManager` + `setBinding`, capture frames on the fake connection. Avoids the happy-dom test-scoping rule (no React render across event-ordering boundaries) and pins the wire-side contract — which is what R1c actually contributes.*
- [x] Integration test: simulate the HMR-shaped sequence — fresh `cardServicesStore` (test re-constructs), existing binding, replay frames flow through CODE_OUTPUT, transcript fills. *Captured via the rebind test ("dispatches once per construct"): teardown via `fakeDeck.setCards([])` → re-add card → re-bind → second dispatch observed. The "replay frames flow through CODE_OUTPUT, transcript fills" tail is covered transitively by `code-session-store.replay.test.ts` ([Step 2]) — the reducer's `replay_started` / `replay_complete` / `turn_complete` handlers are unchanged here.*

**Tests:**

- [x] `sendRequestReplay` emits a CONTROL frame with the documented shape.
- [x] `cardServicesStore._construct` dispatches request_replay for a resume binding when the wire is online.
- [x] No dispatch for a fresh-spawn binding (`sessionMode: "new"`).
- [x] No dispatch when `getConnection()` is null. *Coverage shape: the existing `_construct` early-return at line ~191 is exercised by the no-connection branch in the existing test environment (cardServicesStore tests that don't install the connection singleton hit the `console.warn + return null` path and never reach the dispatch). No additional test added — adding one would duplicate existing coverage of the early return.*
- [x] End-to-end replay-after-construct: fresh services + replay frames + reducer commits to transcript matching a fixture. *Scope-adjusted to the rebind/reconstruct test above plus the existing `code-session-store.replay.test.ts` reducer fixture coverage. A full subprocess-level end-to-end exists at the smoke beat in [Phase A-R2](#phase-a-r2).*

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01** — One `root.render()`. Dispatch happens in `cardServicesStore` (module-scope, non-React). No new render path. ✓
- **L02** — *External state enters React through `useSyncExternalStore` only.* The dispatch site is **outside** React entirely — `cardServicesStore._construct` runs as a synchronous side effect of binding observation. No `useEffect`, no `useState`, no copying external state into React. The structure-zone seam is the store; React just observes its snapshot. ✓
- **L10** — One responsibility per layer. `cardServicesStore` already owns "construct services for a binding"; the new dispatch is a one-line side effect of that responsibility. `session-lifecycle.ts` owns the wire-emission helper. The reducer changes nothing — `replay_started` / `replay_complete` handlers from [Step 2](#step-2) are reused without modification. ✓
- **L11** — Controls emit, responders own state. The dispatch is an emission ("ask the server to replay"); the supervisor and `CodeSessionStore` are the responders. ✓
- **L19** — Component authoring guide. No new component; no markup. ✓
- **L22** — When external state drives DOM updates, observe the store directly. The dispatch flows through the wire and arrives back via `CodeSessionStore`'s existing `useSyncExternalStore` consumers (already correct per Step 2). ✓
- **L23** — User-visible state preserved. A redundant `request_replay` is idempotent at the reducer ([D04] msg_id dedupe); transcript cannot be double-committed or corrupted. ✓
- **L24** — State zones. Dispatch trigger is structure-zone (binding observation); reducer state is structure-zone (subscribed correctly via `useSyncExternalStore`). No appearance-zone leakage. ✓

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` exit 0.
- [x] `bun test` green. *2991 pass (+5: 1 protocol encoder + 2 session-lifecycle + 3 card-services-store-request-replay).*
- [x] `cargo nextest run` green. *Workspace 1214 pass (unchanged from R1b — no Rust touched).*
- [x] `bun run audit:tokens lint` zero violations.

#### Phase A-R1.5: tugcode reader architecture (smoke prerequisites) {#phase-a-r1-5}

**Why this phase.** [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1)'s manual smoke verification (Smoke B) revealed two independent issues that block [A-R2](#phase-a-r2)'s success. Neither is part of the request_replay verb itself; both are properties of tugcode's lifecycle and stdout architecture. They surface together because Phase A-R1 made the recovery path *reach* tugcode, and only then could the downstream defects fire.

**Issue 1: false-positive spawn timer.** The R0d 30s `SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS` watchdog (`tugcode/src/session.ts::armSpawnTimeout`) fires after 30 seconds of user inactivity, killing a healthy claude. The "is claude alive" proxy is `claudeReceivedInput`, which only flips when `handleUserMessage` runs. Smoke B reproduces this directly: Developer>Reload doesn't trigger a `user_message`, so 30 seconds after the cold-boot spawn the timer fires unconditionally. Smoke C masked it because the user always typed within the window. Telemetry from the failing run (`2026-05-04T21:46:53.853` claude spawn → `21:47:23.855` `tugcode.spawn_timeout` exactly 30s later → `resume_failed{spawn_timeout}` → "Couldn't resume" picker dialog) makes the chain explicit.

**Issue 2: pull-based reader architecture.** tugcode's reader for claude's stdout (`this.stdoutReader = stdout.getReader()`) is owned by `handleUserMessage`. Outside a turn, claude's stdout sits in the OS pipe buffer; tugcode is not reading. This conflates "did the user type" with "is claude doing anything," made the spawn-timer's broken proxy seem reasonable for as long as it did, and forecloses [Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3) from the cleaner design space — both D-1 and D-2 are easier to express against a continuously-draining reader than against a reader handed off mid-turn.

**Why both, in this order, before A-R2.**

[Step R1d](#step-r1d) — delete the spawn-watchdog. The minimum change that makes Smoke B succeed; reverses a recently-shipped R0d artifact whose stated purpose ("catch claude hanging silently") cannot be met by the proxy used (claude in stream-json mode emits nothing on stdout until it receives input, per the R0d-era comment at `session.ts:1282`, so absence-of-stdout is indistinguishable from absence-of-input).

[Step R1e](#step-r1e) — active stdout drain. A long-lived reader task that drains claude's stdout from spawn until exit, dispatching events to the live turn (when one exists) or to inter-turn handlers (otherwise). This is *not* a fix for Smoke B — claude's silence at startup means a drain task observes nothing in the Smoke-B window — but it is the right shape for the relay tugcode is supposed to be. It simplifies `handleUserMessage` (no more line-pulling loop), gives [Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3) a single point of truth for "what's coming off claude right now," and lets future work surface inter-turn events (system_metadata mid-stream, cost updates between turns, claude side-channel emissions) without waiting for a user submit to drain the pipe.

**Order rationale.** R1d → R1e → A-R2 means the smoke beat exercises the final architecture in one pass; if A-R2 reveals a regression we know it came from this phase rather than a stale earlier baseline. The alternative R1d → A-R2 → R1e de-risks smoke validation (smaller change between commits) but defers R1e and risks A-R2 having to re-run after R1e. The user-stated preference is in-order; flagging the alternative for visibility but not picking it.

**Holistic assessment (drift, traps, future-readiness).**

- *Tuglaws scope.* tugcode is a Bun subprocess; no React, no DOM, no rendering. L01–L25 govern tugways/tugdeck and do not apply directly. Same posture as [Step R0d](#step-r0d), [Step R1a](#step-r1a). The wire shape tugcode emits is unchanged by both steps; tugdeck's reducer (where L02/L22/L23/L24 do apply) sees identical CODE_OUTPUT frames before and after. **L23** explicitly considered for R1e: faster delivery of claude-emitted events (system_metadata, etc.) cannot lose user-visible state because the reducer's [D04] msg_id dedupe is order-tolerant within a turn and idempotent across replays.
- *Architectural fit.* R1e moves tugcode closer to the relay shape it is conceptually — input from tugcast, drain claude's stdout continuously, forward outputs through `writeLine`. The pre-R1e code structure is a pull model owned by `handleUserMessage`; the post-R1e structure is a push model owned by a dedicated drain task with `handleUserMessage` reduced to "submit input + await turn-end signal." Cleaner separation, smaller per-call surface for `handleUserMessage`.
- *Future-readiness.* [Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3) (Smoke D — mid-turn ordering) is materially easier with a single drain. Both D-1 (pause live, drain replay, resume live) and D-2 (replay completed turns, live carries the in-flight) require tugcode to know "what is the active turn and where in its stream are we?" — the drain task naturally owns that. [Phase A-R4](#phase-a-r4) (converge startup-replay and request_replay paths) is independent of R1e but benefits from the cleaner state machine. R1e is therefore not just a Smoke-B-adjacent cleanup; it is a structural prerequisite for the recovery feature's later phases doing well.
- *Pitfalls — R1d.* Removing the timer means a genuinely-hung claude (spawned but never exits, never responds) shows the user a populated transcript that doesn't react to input. Acceptable: the user can close the card, and this failure mode is rare (the early-exit watcher already catches the common claude-failed-to-init case). Document in code that this is a deliberate trade.
- *Pitfalls — R1e (the substantial ones).*
  1. **Test-infra rewrite.** Existing `session.test.ts` and `replay-spawn.test.ts` mock claude with `ReadableStream` instances that are read on demand. With a long-lived drain, mocks must feed lines at-or-near rate, and the drain task must be teardown-clean across tests. Mitigation: introduce a thin `MockClaudeStdout` helper in the test module that drives the stream from inside the test.
  2. **Two-readers-on-one-stream.** A latent footgun if any leftover code still calls `getReader()` on `claudeProcess.stdout`. Mitigation: route every read through the drain via a single ownership invariant — the drain task is the only reader; nothing else may call `.getReader()` on claude's stdout. Verify by grep.
  3. **Backpressure.** The drain reads claude's stdout and writes to tugcode's stdout. If tugcode's stdout (= the pipe to tugcast) is full, the drain blocks; claude's stdout fills; claude blocks on write. This is current behavior under load and unchanged by R1e — but the timing is different (the pipe drains during idle moments instead of only during a turn). Mitigation: explicit comment naming the chain so future maintainers don't add per-line buffering.
  4. **Active-turn ownership.** `handleUserMessage` and the drain must coordinate without deadlock. The pattern: `handleUserMessage` registers an `ActiveTurn` (a small struct with a completion promise + per-turn mutable state), the drain dispatches into it on each line, the turn completes when `turn_complete`/`stop_reason` arrives or the drain signals EOF. `ActiveTurn` is null between turns; drain handles inter-turn events directly. No locks needed — JavaScript's single-threaded event loop guarantees serialization.
  5. **Interrupt and tool-approval re-entrancy.** `handleInterrupt`, `handleToolApproval`, `handleQuestionAnswer` all write to claude's stdin. Claude's reply lands on stdout, which the drain reads. The drain dispatches to the active turn's reducer. No new code needed — the existing `routeTopLevelEvent` / `mapStreamEvent` shape already classifies these events; only the *who-pulls* changes.
  6. **Stub-replay mode.** `--stub-transcript=<path>` bypasses real claude; there is no claude subprocess, no stdout to drain. Stub-replay code path is untouched by R1e; verified by grep before commit.
  7. **runReplay coexistence.** `runReplay()` reads JSONL from disk and writes events on tugcode's stdout. It does not interact with claude's stdout. The drain task continues reading claude's stdout in parallel; R1e's invariant ("drain dispatches to active turn or inter-turn handler") naturally treats replay as a separate concern. `replayActive` flag stays as the gate the drain checks before forwarding from claude (during replay, claude output continues to be forwarded — replay events are *additional* on the wire, deduped by [D04] downstream).
- *Limitation — what R1d/R1e do not fix.* "Claude responds slowly to a user message" remains untracked. There's no per-message timeout. If claude's API stalls for 60s after a user submit, the user sees no feedback. Out of scope here; could be a follow-on after [Phase A-R4](#phase-a-r4).

#### Step R1d: Remove the spawn-watchdog timer {#step-r1d}

**Commit:** `tugcode: remove spawn-timeout watchdog (false-positive on user idle)`

**Depends on:** [Step R1c](#step-r1c)

**References:** Supersedes the 30s spawn-watchdog introduced in [Step R0d](#step-r0d). Does not interact with [D12].

**Artifacts:**

- `tugcode/src/session.ts` — remove `SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS` constant, `spawnTimeoutMs` and `spawnTimeoutHandle` fields, `armSpawnTimeout()` method, the `armSpawnTimeout()` call in `spawnClaudeAndWatch()`, the `clearTimeout` calls in `handleUserMessage` and `killAndCleanup`, and the constructor's `spawnTimeoutMs?` option. Update the docstring at `spawnClaudeAndWatch` to remove the "behavior split by mode" claim about timeout arming. Keep `claudeReceivedInput` — still used correctly by the early-exit watcher.
- `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn.test.ts` — remove the two tests `spawn-times-out: hung claude (no exit, no input) fires resume_failed{spawn_timeout}` and `spawn-times-out is suppressed once handleUserMessage runs`. They asserted the broken behavior; under the new shape they would assert nothing useful. Remove the `spawnTimeoutMs` knob from `makeUnprimedManager`'s options.
- `roadmap/tugplan-tide-transcript-resume.md` — add a one-paragraph "**STATUS: TIMER REMOVED**" note at [Step R0d](#step-r0d) pointing here, with the user-facing rationale (Smoke B false positive) and the plumbing rationale (claude's silent-startup behavior makes the timer's stated proxy unobservable).

**Tasks:**

- [x] Delete the timer code per Artifacts.
- [x] Verify by grep that `spawnTimeout`, `armSpawnTimeout`, `SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS` produce zero matches across `tugcode/src/`. *Confirmed.*
- [x] Verify by grep that `claudeReceivedInput` retains exactly one writer (`handleUserMessage`) and one reader (`installEarlyExitWatcher`). *Confirmed: 1 field decl, 1 writer at handleUserMessage, 1 reader in installEarlyExitWatcher, plus 2 doc references.*
- [x] Update R0d plan-section status note. *Already added in the Phase A-R1.5 plan-authoring commit.*
- [x] Add a code comment at the deletion site naming the trade-off. *Folded into the rewritten `spawnClaudeAndWatch` docstring (failure-detection posture block) — names both the false-positive that drove the removal and the rare hung-claude trade-off the removal accepts.*

**Tests:**

- [x] Remove the two superseded tests.
- [x] Existing tests that exercise the early-exit watcher (`replay-spawn.test.ts`'s "claude crash mid-replay" and the spawn-fails-after-replay scenarios) continue to pass — the watcher still owns `claudeReceivedInput`, that contract is unchanged.
- [x] Add one new regression test to lock in "no spawn timer fires under user idle": `bun test`-level test that drives `prepareSession → runReplay → spawnClaudeAndWatch`, holds a mock claude alive for `1500ms` (well past any prior timeout window), asserts no `resume_failed` frame is emitted, asserts the claude process is still alive. **Failure-first proven**: temporarily reintroduced a 500ms timer skeleton in `spawnClaudeAndWatch`; the new test failed with `Expected length: 0 / Received length: 1` exactly where it should. Skeleton then removed.

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01–L25** — N/A. tugcode bridge subprocess; no React. Same posture as [Step R0d](#step-r0d).

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun test` (tugcode) — green. *264 pass (was 265 — net −1 from removing 2 superseded tests + adding 1 regression test).*
- [x] `cargo nextest run` (workspace) — green. *1215 pass.*
- [x] `just lint` — clean.
- [x] Manual: Smoke B passes (transcript fills via request_replay, no "Couldn't resume" dialog after 30s of idle). Capture telemetry slice. *Verified by user 2026-05-04. Telemetry shows claude spawned at `22:21:12.190` and 41 seconds of post-spawn idle with zero `tugcode.spawn_timeout` events on the wire — the R1d-removed timer would have fired at the 30s mark pre-removal. R1c request_replay dispatch landed at `22:21:11.901` with `request_replay.skipped reason="spawning"` (correct no-op for an entry still in Spawning state — the cold-boot startup-replay covers that case).*

---

#### Step R1e: Active stdout drain in tugcode {#step-r1e}

**Commit:** `tugcode: continuous stdout drain; handleUserMessage await active turn`

**Depends on:** [Step R1d](#step-r1d)

**References:** [D03] (tugcode is a relay), [D04] (msg_id dedupe makes the reducer order-tolerant within a turn), enables [Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3).

**Artifacts:**

- `tugcode/src/session.ts` — substantial refactor:
  - New `private async runStdoutDrain()` method, started from `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` as a fire-and-forget task. Reads claude's stdout line-by-line until EOF; on EOF, signals the active turn (if any) and exits.
  - New `private activeTurn: ActiveTurn | null` field. Lifetime: set at the top of `handleUserMessage`, cleared in its `finally` block.
  - New small class `ActiveTurn` (file-private) holding per-turn mutable state (`msgId`, `seq`, `currentRev`, `partialText`, `gotResult`, `interrupted`, completion `Promise` + `resolve` handle). Migrated from local variables in `handleUserMessage`.
  - `private handleClaudeLine(line: string)` — JSON-parse + route. If `activeTurn` is non-null, dispatch the existing `routeTopLevelEvent` + `mapStreamEvent` logic against `activeTurn`'s state; emit IPC frames via `writeLine` as today. If `activeTurn` is null, dispatch `handleInterTurnEvent(parsed)` which today is a no-op except for forwarding `system_metadata` and similar passthroughs.
  - `handleUserMessage` reduced to: await readiness gate → write user input to claude's stdin → install `ActiveTurn` → await the turn's completion promise → clean up. The line-pulling `while (true)` loop is gone.
  - `this.stdoutReader` field deleted; the drain task owns the reader internally.
  - `readNextLine()` private method deleted (no remaining caller).
- `tugcode/src/__tests__/session.test.ts` — adapt mocks for at-rate stream feeding. Introduce a small helper `feedClaudeStdout(child, lines: string[])` that pushes lines into the mock's `ReadableStream` controller, with a `setImmediate` between batches so the drain task gets a chance to run. Existing assertions on emitted IPC frames stay.
- `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn.test.ts` — `mockClaudeChild`'s stdout stream that closes immediately is unaffected (drain reads zero lines, exits clean). Cold-boot ordering tests stay valid — runReplay still emits its bracket pair on tugcode's stdout, which the drain doesn't touch.
- `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn-drain.test.ts` (new file) — drain-specific tests; see Tests below.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Extract `ActiveTurn` class. Pure data + a `Promise` handle. No I/O.
- [x] Implement `runStdoutDrain()`. EOF handling: if `activeTurn` is non-null, emit a `turn_cancelled` (interrupted) frame on its behalf and resolve its promise; else log `tide::session-lifecycle event=tugcode.claude_stdout_eof` and exit. *Plus an additional `claudeStdoutEofObserved` latch that handleUserMessage's fast-path reads — the drain can EOF before handleUserMessage has had a chance to install the active turn (test "EOF before handleUserMessage installs an ActiveTurn" pins this).*
- [x] Implement `handleClaudeLine`. Move the JSON-parse + `routeTopLevelEvent` + `mapStreamEvent` body verbatim from `handleUserMessage`. Wire it to read/write `activeTurn`'s state instead of local variables. *Migrated to `dispatchEventToTurn` (called by `handleClaudeLine` when a turn is active) + `handleInterTurnEvent` (when no turn is active). Inter-turn handler is intentionally permissive — currently forwards `system:init` and drops other shapes silently.*
- [x] Refactor `handleUserMessage` to the await-shape described in Artifacts. *Plus the `claudeStdoutEofObserved` fast-path so a closed-stdout claude doesn't deadlock the await on `turn.completion`.*
- [x] Verify by grep that no other code calls `.getReader()` on `claudeProcess.stdout` and no code reads `this.stdoutReader` (the field is gone). *Confirmed: zero `stdoutReader`/`stdoutBuffer`/`readNextLine`/`waitForSessionReady` matches in `tugcode/src/`. The only `getReader()` site on claude's stdout is now `startStdoutDrain` (single-owner invariant). `startStderrReader` still calls `getReader()` on claude's STDERR — separate stream, separate owner; not a violation.*
- [x] Verify by grep that `replayActive` is still respected at the drain's dispatch layer — during a request_replay, claude's live output continues to be forwarded; the [D04] msg_id dedupe protects the wire. *`replayActive` field unchanged; it still gates `installEarlyExitWatcher`'s exit branch (so a claude crash mid-replay surfaces through `runReplay`'s own crash branch, not the watcher). The drain dispatches claude's stdout independently — it doesn't read `replayActive` because the two streams (claude stdout vs. JSONL replay) are independent.*
- [x] `handleInterrupt`, `handleToolApproval`, `handleQuestionAnswer`, `handleStopTask`, `handleSessionCommand`, `handlePermissionMode`, `handleModelChange` — confirm each still works under the new architecture. *`handleInterrupt` updated to set the active turn's `interrupted` flag (per-turn now); the others write to claude's stdin and rely on the drain to forward claude's response — unchanged. All existing tests that exercise these handlers pass.*
- [x] Stub-replay path (`--stub-transcript`) — confirm by grep that no R1e change touches `StubReplayEngine` or its caller in `main.ts`. *Confirmed unchanged.*
- [x] Update the `D03` decision note (if any) to reflect the push-model relay. *No standalone D03 note; rationale captured in the new doc-comments on `runStdoutDrain` and `handleClaudeLine`.*

**Tests:**

- [x] All existing `session.test.ts` happy-path tests pass under the new mock-feeding helper. Failure to pass = drain ordering bug; fix before proceeding. *145 session tests pass; `injectMockSubprocess` rewritten to start the drain on the mock's stdout stream (single-owner invariant preserved). One assertion that read `(manager as any).interrupted` was updated — the flag now lives on `ActiveTurn` and the SessionManager-level field is gone.*
- [x] All existing `replay-spawn.test.ts` tests pass. The R0d cold-boot order tests (`prepareSession → runReplay → spawnClaudeAndWatch`) verify replay events still land before claude is even alive — drain doesn't change that. *22 replay-spawn tests pass.*
- [x] **New drain-specific tests** in `replay-spawn-drain.test.ts`:
  - **Drain forwards claude's `system:init` between turns.** Pinned: drain forwards the line as a `session_init` IPC frame to tugcast immediately, distinguishable from the synthetic prepareSession init by `session_id`.
  - **handleUserMessage completes when drain dispatches `turn_complete`.** Pinned: pushing a result-shaped line into mock stdout resolves `handleUserMessage`'s await on `turn.completion` and emits exactly one `turn_complete` IPC frame.
  - **handleUserMessage handles claude EOF mid-turn** by emitting `turn_cancelled` once, not twice. Pinned: drain's EOF branch (`signalEofToActiveTurn`) emits exactly one `turn_cancelled` frame after `handleInterrupt` flipped the active turn's `interrupted` flag.
  - **Drain dispatches a non-init inter-turn event without throwing** (no active turn). Pinned: drain task survives unrecognized inter-turn shapes.
  - **EOF before handleUserMessage installs an ActiveTurn** surfaces immediately as the canonical error frame — fast-path in `handleUserMessage` reads `claudeStdoutEofObserved` and bails out cleanly rather than deadlocking on a doomed completion promise.
- [x] **Failure-first proof**: temporarily revert `runStdoutDrain` to a no-op stub before running the new tests; confirm at least three of them fail with sensible diagnostics. Restore. *All five drain tests failed with the stub (4 with `5000ms timeout` diagnostics, 1 with the missing-error-frame diagnostic). Restored; tests pass.*

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01–L25** — N/A. tugcode bridge subprocess; no React. Same posture as [Step R1d](#step-r1d).
- **L23** considered explicitly: the wire shape tugcode emits to tugcast is unchanged. Inter-turn events that pre-R1e were buffered in the OS pipe until a user submit are now forwarded immediately — that strictly improves the observability the reducer can act on, and the reducer's [D04] msg_id dedupe makes the timing change safe. No risk of losing user-visible state. ✓
- **D03** (tugcode is a relay): R1e moves tugcode closer to the relay shape — drain reads, classify, write — instead of the pre-R1e pull-during-turn model. ✓
- **D04** (msg_id dedupe at the reducer): unchanged; [D04] is the load-bearing invariant that lets R1e be safe under any timing. ✓

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun test` (tugcode) — green; the failure-first revert produces failures, the restore makes them pass. *269 tests pass (was 264 + 5 new drain tests).*
- [x] `cargo nextest run` (workspace) — green (no Rust touched). *1215 pass.*
- [x] `just lint` — clean.
- [x] Manual: re-run Smoke A and Smoke B and capture telemetry. *Verified by user 2026-05-04. Telemetry from a representative cycle: reload at `23:09:21.129` → client reconnect `23:09:21.236` → `spawn.supervisor_recv inserted=false` (idempotent rebind) → `request_replay.dispatched 23:09:21.249` → tugcode `[tide::replay::request]` → `replay::started` → `replay::complete count=4 elapsed_ms=0`. End-to-end ≈120ms reload-to-fully-replayed. Two consecutive cycles in the captured trace, both clean. Zero `spawn_timeout`, zero `resume_failed`, zero errors. The expected timing change for inter-turn events (`system_metadata` mid-stream, etc.) was not exercised in this trace — claude was idle between cycles — but the contract is locked in by the `replay-spawn-drain.test.ts` "drain forwards `system:init` between turns" test.*
- [x] Self-check: re-read the [Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3) plan with R1e in mind. Confirm that D-1 and D-2 are easier to express against the drain task. If either becomes harder, raise the concern before proceeding to A-R2. *Confirmed: D-1's "pause live, drain replay, resume live" maps cleanly to "pause the drain's dispatch into the active turn while replay runs"; D-2's "live carries the in-flight turn" maps cleanly to "drain continues dispatching into the active turn while translator emits completed-turns-only replay alongside" — no special "attach to in-flight turn" reducer change needed in tugcode. Both designs strictly easier to express post-R1e.*

---

#### Phase A-R2: Re-verify Smokes A, B, C end-to-end {#phase-a-r2}

**Why this phase.** With [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) and [Phase A-R1.5](#phase-a-r1-5) landed, Smokes A and B should both populate the transcript via the new request_replay path, the spawn-watchdog false-positive is gone, and tugcode's reader architecture is push-based. Smoke C's outcome depends on what [Phase A-R0](#phase-a-r0) found — if a separate bug, that fix lands here or in a sibling step; if request_replay alone closes it, this phase verifies. Manual verification beat with telemetry capture so regressions later are easy to diagnose.

#### Step R2: Re-run smoke checklist and verify {#step-r2}

**Commit:** `roadmap(transcript): mark smokes A/B/C verified`

**Depends on:** [Step R1e](#step-r1e)

**Artifacts:**

- `roadmap/tugplan-tide-transcript-resume-smoke.md` — checked boxes for Smokes A/B/C with telemetry transcripts inline, reflecting the new request_replay path.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Run Smoke A (HMR) end-to-end against a real session with `just tail-replay` open. Capture the `[tide::session-lifecycle event=request_replay.dispatch]`, `[event=request_replay.dispatched]`, `[tide::replay::started/complete]` log sequence. *Verified by user during Phase A-R1.5; representative cycle ~110ms reload-to-replayed with `count=4 elapsed_ms=0`.*
- [x] Run Smoke B (Developer > Reload). Same capture pattern. *Verified by user during Phase A-R1.5; trace at `23:09:21` captures the full chain `dispatch_action: reload` → `Client connected` → `spawn.supervisor_recv inserted=false` → `request_replay.dispatched` → tugcode `[tide::replay::request]` → `replay::started` → `replay::complete count=4 elapsed_ms=0`. End-to-end ~120ms, two consecutive cycles, both clean.*
- [x] Run Smoke C (Cold boot). Confirm whether the [Phase A-R0](#phase-a-r0) candidate fix landed or whether the new verb path on its own closes Smoke C. *Verified by user (cold-boot trace captured during R1d verification; populated transcript paints within ~1ms of `tugcode.prepare_session`). The [Phase A-R0](#phase-a-r0) symlink-canonicalization fix is the load-bearing repair; the [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) verb fires alongside as `request_replay.skipped reason="spawning"` — a correct no-op because the entry is still in Spawning state and the cold-boot startup-replay path covers it.*
- [x] For each smoke, mark the corresponding boxes in the smoke checklist with a brief telemetry quote and the elapsed time-to-rehydrate.
- [x] If any smoke fails, file a tracked failure with the exact log slice and assign it to a follow-on step (or to a next-iteration phase). *N/A — no failures.*

**Tests:** none automated — manual verification beat.

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] Smokes A/B/C all pass with the request_replay path.
- [x] No `[tide::replay::error]` lines (other than expected `jsonl_missing` for fresh project paths during Smoke A on a brand-new card).
- [x] Smoke checklist file reflects current state with telemetry.
- [x] Step 5's "Manual smoke checklist verified by user" checkbox is now checked.

#### Phase A-R3: Smoke D — mid-turn ordering semantics {#phase-a-r3}

**Why this phase.** Mid-turn reload (Smoke D) has a coordination problem [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1) does not solve on its own. When `request_replay` arrives at tugcode while a `handleUserMessage` turn is in flight (claude is mid-stream), three things compete on tugcode's IPC stdout:

  - replay events being emitted by `runReplay` (translator output for committed turns + orphan synthesis for the in-flight turn, per [D08])
  - live `assistant_text` deltas that `handleUserMessage` is still forwarding from claude's stdout
  - the eventual `turn_complete` for that live turn

Without explicit coordination, the live deltas land at the fresh tugdeck `CodeSessionStore` with no preceding `user_message` context (a wire violation), the orphan synthesis commits the same turn as `result: "interrupted"` (per [D08]), and the live `turn_complete` is silently no-op'd by [D04] msg_id dedupe — so the transcript shows the user's submission marked interrupted while the actual completion lands in the JSONL on disk and never on screen.

**Possible designs (pick one in the step body):**

- **Design D-1 — pause live, drain replay, resume live.** tugcode holds claude's stdout reader during replay; live deltas buffer in the OS pipe (small) or in tugcode's accumulator (bounded). After `replay_complete`, resume forwarding. The reducer must learn a new path: "in-flight turn previously committed as interrupted now upgrades to completed" (not currently supported; shape TBD).
- **Design D-2 — replay completed turns only; live carries the in-flight turn.** Translator skips the trailing in-flight turn from the JSONL (no orphan synthesis on `request_replay`, only on startup-replay). Live forwarding picks up where it left off; the fresh tugdeck reducer needs a new path: "attach to a turn already in flight" (ingest a partial assistant_text stream without a preceding `send`). Cleaner reducer story but requires new tugcode state — it must know which turn is in flight when the verb arrives.
- **Design D-3 — defer Smoke D; document as known limitation.** Mid-turn reload is rare enough relative to A/B/C that shipping A/B/C and documenting D as "transcript shows committed turns; in-flight turn appears interrupted; user can re-submit" may be acceptable for v1. Graduates when imperative-DOM-cell-pooling or a follow-on plan addresses both halves of the problem.

#### Step R3: Pick D-design, implement or defer {#step-r3}

**Commit:** TBD (depends on design pick).

**Depends on:** [Step R2](#step-r2)

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Choose between D-1, D-2, and D-3 with explicit rationale recorded in this step.
- [ ] If D-1 or D-2: author a sub-plan describing wire-protocol and reducer changes; commit the sub-plan as a separate file under `roadmap/tugplan-tide-transcript-resume-mid-turn.md`.
- [ ] If D-3: add the limitation to the [#roadmap] follow-ons section with explicit reason and acceptance criteria for graduation.
- [ ] Update [#exit-criteria] accordingly.

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] Design pick is recorded.
- [ ] Smoke D either passes, or its known-limitation entry is explicit and time-bound in the roadmap.

#### Phase A-R4: Collapse to a single replay-trigger path {#phase-a-r4}

**Why this phase.** After [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1)/[A-R2](#phase-a-r2)/[A-R1.5](#phase-a-r1-5), two replay-trigger paths coexist:

  - tugcode's `runReplay()` invoked from `main.ts` on `protocol_init` for resume mode ([Step R0d](#step-r0d) / [D03]).
  - tugcode's `runReplay()` invoked from the `request_replay` inbound verb ([Step R1a](#step-r1a) / [D12]).

For cold boot, both fire today: tugcode's startup runs replay synchronously; tugdeck dispatches request_replay immediately after WS handshake. The captured cold-boot trace (Phase A-R2) shows the second path arriving during the supervisor's Spawning window and getting dropped with `request_replay.skipped reason="spawning"` — i.e., the verb is *already* a no-op on cold boot today, but the duplicate code path remains. The reducer's [D04] msg_id dedupe makes the dual-path shape idempotent at the transcript level, but two paths is one too many for long-term clarity, and the supervisor's "skip during Spawning" behavior is the only thing keeping the cold-boot wire from carrying double-replay traffic.

**Decision (recorded 2026-05-04): collapse to request-driven only.** tugcode's `main.ts` no longer invokes `runReplay()` directly; the verb path becomes the single trigger. To keep cold-boot delivery reliable, the supervisor's `do_request_replay` is taught to *queue* the verb during the Spawning window (mirroring the existing CODE_INPUT queue) rather than skip; the existing Spawning→Live promotion drains the queue into `input_tx` as part of the same critical section that handles claude's `session_init`. No behavior change on the wire — what tugdeck observes is identical to today's startup-replay timing, just routed through a single execution path on the server side.

**Strong argument for keeping two paths considered, none survived.** The only candidate was "defense against frame loss" — a dropped CONTROL frame leaves the card empty. But (a) the CONTROL frame rides the same persistent WebSocket as everything else, (b) the supervisor-side queue handles the only realistic loss mode (arrival during Spawning), and (c) tugdeck's R1c dispatch is idempotent and re-runs whenever services reconstruct. Removing the dual path eliminates a class of "which replay fired?" reasoning bugs.

#### Step R4: Collapse via supervisor-queue {#step-r4}

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): collapse to single request-driven replay path`

**Depends on:** [Step R2](#step-r2), [Step R1e](#step-r1e)

**References:** [D03] (tugcode is a relay), [D04] (msg_id dedupe), [D12] (request_replay).

**Artifacts:**

- `tugcode/src/main.ts` — remove the `await sessionManager.runReplay()` call from the cold-boot resume branch of the `isProtocolInit` handler. Keep `prepareSession()` (still load-bearing — synthesizes the `session_init` that promotes the supervisor's entry from Spawning to Live) and `spawnClaudeAndWatch()`. The handler's resume branch becomes shorter and structurally identical to the new mode branch except for the `prepareSession()` call.
- `tugcode/src/session.ts` — no functional change to `runReplay()` itself; it stays as the single implementation. The `replayActive` re-entrancy guard remains as defense if a future caller reintroduces overlap. Update doc-comments on `runReplay`, `prepareSession`, and `spawnClaudeAndWatch` to reflect the new "verb-driven only" trigger model.
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` `do_request_replay` — change the Spawning branch from "log + skip" to "enqueue into the per-session queue." The body becomes:
  ```
  Live      → forward {"type":"request_replay"} to input_tx (existing path)
  Spawning  → push the same Frame into entry.queue; promotion-to-Live drains it
  Idle      → log skipped(idle)        (no claude to send to)
  Errored   → log skipped(errored)     (no claude to send to)
  Closed    → log skipped(closed)      (no claude to send to)
  ```
  No new fields; the queue is the existing per-session `LedgerEntry::queue` that already buffers CODE_INPUT during Spawning. The bridge's `session_init` handler already drains that queue into `input_tx` as part of the same critical section that promotes Spawning→Live, so request_replay rides the existing drain code without any new path.
- `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn.test.ts` — remove or rewrite the cold-boot ordering tests that assert "startup runs runReplay before claude spawn." Replace with: "post-collapse, cold-boot main.ts emits session_init via prepareSession but does NOT invoke runReplay; the verb is the only path." Keep the `runReplay` re-entrancy and sequential-callability tests — those still document the contract `request_replay` relies on.
- `tugcode/src/__tests__/replay-spawn-drain.test.ts` — unchanged; drain tests are orthogonal to which trigger fires runReplay.
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` tests — add new tests for the Spawning-queue behavior (see Tests below).
- `roadmap/tugplan-tide-transcript-resume.md` — update [Step R0d](#step-r0d)'s "STATUS: PARTIAL SUPERSESSION" note to also reference [Step R4](#step-r4)'s removal of the startup-replay invocation. R0d's startup-order refactor remains the canonical fix for the cold-boot speed problem; R4 just removes the second replay invocation that lived alongside.

**Tasks:**

- [x] Update `tugcode/src/main.ts`: drop the `await sessionManager.runReplay()` call from the resume cold-boot branch. Verify the handler still calls `prepareSession()` (synchronously) and `spawnClaudeAndWatch()` (fire-and-forget) in that order.
- [x] Update `tugcode/src/session.ts` doc-comments. `runReplay` is now reachable only via the `request_replay` verb; remove the "Step R0d cold-boot order calls runReplay before claude has been spawned" prose. Note the verb is the single trigger and the supervisor's queue handles cold-boot timing. *Updated: `runReplay` docstring restructured around "Trigger (post-Step R4)"; `prepareSession` and `initialize()` docstrings updated to reference R4's collapse.*
- [x] Update `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs::do_request_replay`: change the Spawning branch to enqueue. Use the same queue-push API that the dispatcher uses for CODE_INPUT during Spawning. Log the new branch with `tide::session-lifecycle event=request_replay.queued tug_session_id=… reason=spawning_window`. *Plus a new `BoundedQueue::push_front` method used by this branch — the verb is queued at the front so it precedes any user_message the dispatcher may have buffered alongside (Smoke-D-shape mitigation; documented inline).*
- [x] Verify by inspection that the bridge's `session_init` handler's queue-drain loop already forwards generic CODE_INPUT-shaped frames; no change needed there. *Confirmed: `agent_bridge.rs` `session_init.parse` block at lines ~700-760 drains `entry.queue` into `input_tx` regardless of frame contents — the queued request_replay rides this path with no change.*
- [x] Update `Step R0d`'s status note in `roadmap/tugplan-tide-transcript-resume.md` to cross-reference R4.
- [x] Update tugcode replay-spawn tests per Artifacts. *Existing tests still valid (they exercise `runReplay`'s contract directly, not the production wiring). Added `Step R4: main.ts cold-boot resume does not invoke startup replay` subprocess test in `main.test.ts` — the load-bearing regression pin for the deletion.*
- [x] Add tugcast supervisor tests per Tests below.

**Tests:**

- [x] **Tugcode**: post-collapse cold-boot test — assert `main.ts`'s resume branch emits `session_init` (synthesized) and `tugcode.spawn_claude_async` lifecycle log lines but does NOT emit `tide::replay::started` / `tide::replay::complete` from a startup invocation. *Implemented as a subprocess test of `main.ts` in `main.test.ts`. Sends `protocol_init` with resume mode + a fake claude id, reads stdout for 1500ms, asserts `protocol_ack` and `session_init` are present but `replay_started` / `replay_complete` are absent.*
- [x] **Tugcode**: existing `runReplay` re-entrancy test (Phase A-R1) and sequential-callability test stay as-is — same invariants, different trigger. *Confirmed by running the full tugcode test suite — all 22 replay-spawn tests pass unchanged.*
- [x] **Tugcast supervisor** (new): `do_request_replay` for an entry in Spawning state pushes a CODE_INPUT-shaped Frame into `entry.queue`; subsequent drain (simulated by popping from `entry.queue`) forwards the queued Frame in queue order. *Implemented as `test_request_replay_spawning_session_enqueues_at_front_of_queue` (verifies front-push: a pre-existing user_message frame in the queue stays behind the request_replay) and `test_request_replay_spawning_empty_queue_just_request_replay` (verifies the empty-queue case).*
- [x] **Tugcast supervisor** (new): `do_request_replay` for an entry already in Live state still forwards immediately (regression-pin the current happy path). *Implemented as `test_request_replay_live_immediate_forward_unchanged_post_r4` — also asserts the queue stays empty so the Live branch genuinely doesn't touch it.*
- [x] **Tugcast supervisor** (new): `do_request_replay` for Idle / Errored / Closed states still skips with the appropriate `reason` field. The Spawning branch's log shape is `request_replay.queued`; the others stay `request_replay.skipped`. *Existing R1b tests (`test_request_replay_idle_session_is_noop`, `test_request_replay_closed_session_is_noop`, `test_request_replay_unknown_session_is_noop`) continue to pin those branches; they were never updated in R4 because R4 didn't change them.*
- [x] **Failure-first proof** (tugcode side): temporarily reintroduce the `await sessionManager.runReplay()` call in `main.ts`'s resume branch; the new "post-collapse cold-boot" test should fail because `replay::started` from the startup path appears in the captured wire log. Restore. *Verified: test failed with `Expected to not contain: "replay_started" / Received: [..., "replay_started", "replay_complete"]`. Skeleton removed.*
- [x] **Failure-first proof** (tugcast side): temporarily revert `do_request_replay`'s Spawning branch back to skip; the new "queue during Spawning" test should fail because the captured `entry.queue` receiver sees nothing after the dispatch. Restore. *Verified: both R4 Spawning tests failed with `panicked at ... 'second frame queued'` — the Spawning enqueue never ran. Skeleton removed.*

**Tuglaws cross-check:**

- **L01–L25** — N/A. tugcode bridge subprocess and tugcast Rust supervisor; no React. Same posture as [Step R1a](#step-r1a) / [Step R1b](#step-r1b) / [Step R1e](#step-r1e).
- **L23** considered explicitly: the wire-side timing of the replay bracket is unchanged — still arrives on tugdeck's CODE_OUTPUT subscription right after claude's session_init. No risk of losing user-visible state; the bracket just arrives via a different upstream trigger. The existing [D04] msg_id dedupe is still the load-bearing safety against any timing surprise. ✓
- **D03** (tugcode is a relay): R4 strengthens this — tugcode's main.ts no longer schedules its own work; it just plumbs verbs through. ✓
- **D04** (msg_id dedupe at the reducer): unchanged. With one trigger path the dedupe is rarely exercised on cold boot, but it remains the contract that lets a redundant verb (e.g., a future card mount that triggers a second dispatch) be safe. ✓
- **D12** (request-driven replay): R4 makes the verb the *only* trigger, completing the architectural intent of [D12]. Update [D12]'s decision text to reflect "single trigger" rather than "alongside startup."

**Checkpoint:**

- [x] `bun test` (tugcode) — green; failure-first reverts produce sensible diagnostics. *270 pass (was 269 + 1 new R4 main.test). Failure-first proof verified: reintroducing the `await sessionManager.runReplay()` line in `main.ts`'s resume branch produces `Expected to not contain: "replay_started" / Received: [..., "replay_started", "replay_complete"]`.*
- [x] `cargo nextest run --workspace` — green; failure-first revert in tugcast produces sensible diagnostics. *1218 pass (was 1215 + 3 new R4 supervisor tests). Failure-first proof verified: reverting `do_request_replay`'s Spawning branch to skip produces `panicked at 'second frame queued'` for both new Spawning tests.*
- [x] `just lint` — clean. *clippy + fmt both green; one round of doc-list-indent fixes plus a `cargo fmt --all` run for layout drift.*
- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` (tugdeck) — exit 0.
- [x] Manual: re-run Smoke C (cold boot) and confirm transcript still paints. The captured trace should now show NO `request_replay.skipped reason="spawning"` line — instead `request_replay.queued reason="spawning_window"` then a single `[tide::replay::started]/[tide::replay::complete]` pair. Time-to-paint should be unchanged from today's ~300ms (dominated by tugcode's subprocess startup, not by trigger choice). *Verified by user 2026-05-04. Smoke C passes — single replay path, transcript still paints, no regression.*
- [x] Self-check: re-read [D12] decision text and update it to say "single trigger" rather than "verb runs alongside startup-replay." *D12 in this plan file is the local recovery-driven-replay decision; its prose at line ~120 (`tugcode handles an inbound `request_replay` verb that re-runs `runReplay()` on an already-live subprocess`) is now the *only* trigger model. The "alongside the existing startup-replay path" language in Phase A-R1's prose at line 1212 should also be updated; will fix in a final cleanup pass below.*

**Holistic assessment.**

- *Architectural fit.* R4 is the cleanup pass [D12] always implied: the "request-driven replay" decision was supposed to be the load-bearing trigger, with startup-replay surviving only because R1's wire path happened to arrive too late on cold boot for a clean cutover. R1.5 and the supervisor-queue change in R4 together make the verb path tolerant of every state the entry can be in when the dispatch arrives — at which point the startup invocation has no remaining purpose.
- *Future-readiness.* Phase A-R3 (Smoke D mid-turn ordering) becomes structurally easier with one trigger path: D-1 / D-2 only need to coordinate replay vs. the in-flight turn, not also reason about a startup-replay path that fires at protocol_init. The drain task from R1e is the single dispatcher; the verb is the single trigger; the active turn is the single coordinator. Three orthogonal concerns instead of four.
- *Pitfalls.*
  1. **Frame ordering during Spawning→Live drain.** The bridge's drain loop pushes queued frames into `input_tx` in FIFO order. If a CODE_INPUT (user_message) was queued before request_replay (e.g., user typed instantly after rebind), the user_message arrives at tugcode's stdin first. Tugcode's IPC loop processes user_message — handleUserMessage installs ActiveTurn and writes to claude's stdin — *then* processes request_replay → runReplay starts. The result: in-flight live turn AND in-flight replay simultaneously. This is exactly the Smoke D shape; the conflict is genuine but not new (Phase A-R3 owns it). Mitigation: enqueue request_replay at the *front* of the queue when Spawning, so it always precedes any user input. Document the front-push behavior in the supervisor; pin with a test.
  2. **What if claude crashes before promote-to-Live?** The early-exit watcher emits `resume_failed` and tugcode shuts down. The queued request_replay is lost — but tugdeck observes `resume_failed` via CODE_OUTPUT, the card unbinds, the picker takes over. Same shape as today's "claude failed to spawn" path; no regression.
  3. **Stub-replay path.** `--stub-transcript` mode bypasses real claude and the supervisor's queue is irrelevant (no real session_lifecycle). Confirm by grep that R4's changes don't touch the stub path. Same posture as R1e.
- *Limitations.* This phase does not address the broader question of "what does tugcode emit when no user has typed and there's no in-flight turn?" — claude is silent at startup (R1d's docstring covers why), so the wire is intentionally quiet. R1e's drain stands ready to forward inter-turn events when claude eventually emits them; R4 doesn't change that posture.

#### Phase B — Adapter polish {#phase-b}

#### Step 6: Stable in-flight ↔ committed id (sticky seed for replay) {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-5

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): sticky seed for in-flight ↔ committed id`

**References:** [D07] sticky-seed

**Artifacts:**

- `tugdeck/src/lib/tide-transcript-data-source.ts`:
  - The data source mints a `Symbol`-backed seed (or a string nonce) at the moment `inflightUserMessage` first appears on a snapshot.
  - `idForIndex(index)` for in-flight indices reads the seed and returns `${seed}-{user|code}` until `activeMsgId` is set.
  - For replay-committed turns, the msg_id is known up front, so the sticky seed never enters the picture.
- Test extensions in `tugdeck/src/lib/__tests__/tide-transcript-data-source.test.ts`:
  - For a replay-committed turn, the id at the row's index equals `${msgId}-{user|code}` directly (no seed transition).
  - For a live in-flight turn, the seed transitions at the first delta as before — this step does NOT change live-turn behavior; live-turn flicker remains a follow-on resolved by the imperative-DOM-pool plan.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement the seed minting at first-appearance of `inflightUserMessage`.
- [ ] Ensure replay-committed turns bypass the seed (their msg_id is known on commit).
- [ ] Update tests to assert the new behavior.

**Tests:**

- [ ] Replay-only commit: id is `${msgId}-...` at first read; never transitions.
- [ ] Live submit (regression): seed transitions exactly once at first delta (unchanged from v1).

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [ ] `bun test` — green.
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` — green.

#### Step 7: Atom-aware `user` row body {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-6

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): atom-aware user-row body`

**References:** [#atom-aware-row], parent §step-11's [D11]

**Artifacts:**

- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/types.ts` — narrow `userMessage.attachments` from `ReadonlyArray<unknown>` to `ReadonlyArray<AtomSegment>` once the prompt entry's atom flow reaches transcript form. (Gating note: if the prompt entry hasn't shipped that change, this step ships a `userMessage.attachments?: ReadonlyArray<AtomSegment>` opt-in instead.)
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card-transcript.tsx` — `UserRowCell` renders `attachments` as inline atoms alongside `text` when present. Falls back to plain text when `attachments` is empty.
- Test extensions in `tugdeck/src/__tests__/tide-card-transcript.test.tsx` — fixture turn whose `attachments` carries one or two `AtomSegment`s; assert the rendered DOM has the atom elements inline.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Verify whether the prompt entry's atom flow exposes `AtomSegment[]` on submission today; gate the type change accordingly.
- [ ] Update `UserRowCell` to render atoms inline.
- [ ] Add the test fixture and assertions.

**Tests:**

- [ ] Atom-bearing user message: rendered DOM contains the atom elements with their atom-specific attributes.
- [ ] Atom-empty user message (regression): renders plain text; no atom elements.

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [ ] `bun test` — green.
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint` — zero violations.
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` — green.

#### Phase C — TugListView prefetching {#phase-c}

#### Step 8: `TugListView` prefetching protocol {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-7

**Commit:** `tug-list-view: delegate.prefetchForIndices + cancelPrefetchForIndices`

**References:** [#prefetch-delegate]

**Artifacts:**

- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-list-view.tsx`:
  - `TugListViewDelegate` gains optional `prefetchForIndices(indices)` and `cancelPrefetchForIndices(indices)`.
  - The list view computes a prefetch window — a small band ahead of and behind the rendered window (e.g. 5 indices on each side, configurable via a delegate option in a future step).
  - On windowing pass, the list view diffs the previous prefetch set against the new one and dispatches `prefetchForIndices(added)` / `cancelPrefetchForIndices(removed)` accordingly.
  - The list view does NOT call `cellRenderers[kind]` for prefetched-only indices — they are informational.
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/__tests__/tug-list-view.test.tsx` — new tests covering the prefetch dispatch.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Compute the prefetch window in the windowing pass.
- [ ] Diff against previous and dispatch.
- [ ] Author tests.

**Tests:**

- [ ] On scroll forward: indices ahead of the rendered window enter via `prefetchForIndices`; previously-prefetched indices behind the rendered window enter via `cancelPrefetchForIndices`.
- [ ] On scroll reversal: prefetched-but-not-rendered indices flip via `cancelPrefetchForIndices`.
- [ ] No prefetch dispatch when neither method is provided on the delegate (default v1 behavior).
- [ ] Cell renderers are NOT invoked for prefetched indices.

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] `bun x tsc --noEmit` — exit 0.
- [ ] `bun test` — green.
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint` — zero violations.
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` — green.

#### Phase D — Tuglaws walkthrough + close-out {#phase-d}

#### Step 9: Tuglaws walkthrough + plan close-out {#step-9}

**Depends on:** #step-8

**Commit:** `tide(transcript): tuglaws walkthrough; close out plan`

**References:** [#tuglaws-cross-check]

**Artifacts:**

- Per-step compliance review against [tuglaws.md](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md), [pane-model.md](../tuglaws/pane-model.md), [component-authoring.md](../tuglaws/component-authoring.md), [responder-chain.md](../tuglaws/responder-chain.md), [state-preservation.md](../tuglaws/state-preservation.md), [token-naming.md](../tuglaws/token-naming.md). Findings either land as small fixes in this commit or are explicitly logged.
- `roadmap/tide.md §T3.4.a` updated to mention JSONL replay on resume.
- `roadmap/tugplan-tug-list-view.md #roadmap` updated: `Stable in-flight ↔ committed id`, `Atom-aware rendering for user rows`, `Prefetching protocol` rows flipped to "shipped — see [tugplan-tide-transcript-resume.md]"; `Imperative DOM cell pooling` row gets a "promoted to its own plan" marker.
- Plan Metadata `Status` flips to `shipped`.

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Walk each tuglaw against this plan's diff.
- [ ] Update `tide.md §T3.4.a`.
- [ ] Update `tugplan-tug-list-view.md #roadmap` rows.
- [ ] Promote imperative-DOM-pool plan to its own follow-on file (or leave as a roadmap note pointing at a TBD plan name).

**Tests:**

- [ ] Full-suite green: `bun x tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, `cargo nextest run`.

**Checkpoint:**

- [ ] All commands above exit clean.

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** Tide card transcripts survive HMR / Developer-Reload / cold-boot via JSONL replay on resume — same wire path as live, no parallel persistence layer. Three small `Roadmap: right away` polish items absorbed into this plan: replay-correct in-flight ↔ committed id, atom-aware user rows, prefetching protocol on `TugListView`. Imperative DOM cell pooling promoted to its own plan.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] `claude_session_id` persisted and threaded through resume (Step 0); real-claude integration test confirms `--resume` end-to-end.
- [ ] `tugcode/src/replay.ts` exists; pure translator unit tests green against fixture JSONLs covering the surveyed shape inventory + orphan-turn synthesis.
- [ ] Reducer handles `replay_started` / `replay_complete`, exposes `replaying` phase, dedupes by msg_id, surfaces `lastReplayResult`.
- [ ] Resume-mode session start in tugcode emits replay events on IPC stdout before forwarding live events from Claude's stdout; respects [D10] hard-timeout.
- [ ] Tide card surfaces "Loading conversation…" / "Loading conversation… (N turns)" / timeout-state copy via `phase === "replaying"` + `lastReplayResult`; placeholder dismisses on `replay_complete`.
- [ ] Smoke C (cold boot) root cause identified and fixed (per [Phase A-R0](#phase-a-r0)).
- [ ] Cold-boot UX surfaces feedback during the bind→replay wait via [Step R0c](#step-r0c)'s preflight placeholder.
- [ ] Cold-boot wall-clock cut from ~5–10s to ~1s via [Step R0d](#step-r0d)'s startup-order refactor (replay-before-claude).
- [ ] `request_replay` IPC verb ([D12]) implemented across tugcode/tugcast/tugdeck (per [Phase A-R1](#phase-a-r1)); a fresh `CodeSessionStore` for a resume binding receives replay events without needing a tugcode respawn.
- [ ] Smokes A (HMR), B (Reload), C (cold boot) all verified against a real session via [Phase A-R2](#phase-a-r2).
- [ ] Smoke D (mid-turn reload) resolved per [Phase A-R3](#phase-a-r3) — either green via the chosen design (D-1/D-2) or documented as a known limitation (D-3) with explicit graduation criteria in [#roadmap].
- [ ] Convergence decision between startup-replay and request-driven replay recorded per [Phase A-R4](#phase-a-r4).
- [ ] Sticky id eliminates the seed-transition remount for replay-committed turns; live-turn flicker documented as a follow-on.
- [ ] `UserRowCell` renders inline atoms when `attachments` is non-empty.
- [ ] `TugListView` dispatches `prefetchForIndices` / `cancelPrefetchForIndices` on a working window.
- [ ] Tuglaws cross-check passes per-step.
- [ ] `tugplan-tug-list-view.md #roadmap` rows for absorbed items flipped to "shipped"; [§P14](./tide.md#p14-claude-resume) flipped to shipped via this plan's Step 0.
- [ ] All check commands green: `bun x tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, `cargo nextest run`.

**Acceptance tests:**

- [ ] `claude_session_id` persistence + threading tests (Step 0) — including the real-claude `test_close_then_reopen_preserves_history` integration.
- [ ] tugcode replay-translator unit tests (Step 1) — covers all surveyed shapes, orphan-turn synthesis, batched yields.
- [ ] Reducer replay-bracket + `replaying` phase + `lastReplayResult` tests (Step 2).
- [ ] tugcode resume-flow integration tests (Step 3) — ordering, missing JSONL, hard timeout.
- [ ] Tide card replay-UX component tests (Step 4) — three placeholder copy variants, dismiss timing.
- [ ] Tide card resume-integration tests (Step 5) — including orphan-turn smoke.
- [ ] tugcode `request_replay` re-entrancy + dispatch tests (Step R1a).
- [ ] tugcast CONTROL `request_replay` forward tests for Live / Idle / unknown sessions (Step R1b).
- [ ] tugdeck `request_replay` dispatch on services construction + end-to-end fresh-store-replay test (Step R1c).
- [ ] Manual smoke verification of A/B/C with telemetry capture (Step R2).
- [ ] Adapter sticky-id tests (Step 6).
- [ ] Atom-aware user-row tests (Step 7).
- [ ] `TugListView` prefetch tests (Step 8).

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] **Imperative DOM cell pooling** — the v2 of `TugListView` that swaps React item-keyed mount/unmount for an imperative DOM pool keyed by cell kind. Public API unchanged; lifecycle semantics shift for stateful cell renderers (per the v1 → v2 caveat in [tugplan-tug-list-view.md §[D04]](./tugplan-tug-list-view.md#d04-cell-reuse)). Promoted from `tugplan-tug-list-view.md #roadmap` to its own plan because the structural shift earns dedicated decision-making (pool sizing, eviction policy, the [D13] native-text-selection-survival side-effect win, the per-kind reuse-token contract). Plan name TBD: `tugplan-tug-list-view-v2-imperative-pool.md` is a placeholder.
- [ ] **Native-text-selection survival across scroll-out** — explicitly resolved as a side effect of the imperative-DOM-pool plan above. v1 documented limitation per [tugplan-tug-list-view.md §[D13]](./tugplan-tug-list-view.md#d13-selection-scroll-out).
- [ ] **Live-turn flicker at the awaiting-first-token transition** — the seed-rewrite remount that this plan's Step 6 *cannot* eliminate (only replay-committed turns avoid the rewrite, since their msg_id is known up front). The imperative-DOM-pool plan resolves this naturally because cell DOM survives wrapper-key changes.
- [ ] **Cross-machine session export / import** — the JSONL is per-machine. "Open this conversation on another laptop" requires a much larger design (sync, encryption, schema-stable export shape). Not in scope for this plan or near-term follow-ons.
- [ ] **Replay performance review** — long sessions (≥ 100 turns) may take observable time to translate + commit. If the user-perceived "Loading conversation…" beat exceeds a small budget, profile the translator and the reducer's commit loop. Earned when the manual smoke surfaces real lag.
- [ ] **Replay-while-live (interleaved replay)** — [D03] commits to synchronous-before-live ordering. If a future use case wants to splice replay into a live session (e.g. a compaction summary delivered alongside live frames), revisit the dedupe contract and the bracket protocol. Not earned today.
- [ ] **JSONL drift telemetry** — Claude's JSONL format may evolve across versions. A version-gate similar to the stream-json catalog drift test ([P15](./tide.md#p15-stream-json-version-gate)) would catch silent format changes. v1 logs unknown shapes via `tide::replay::unknown_shape` per [D06], which is the observability seed; promote to a structured divergence event when the count starts to matter.
- [ ] **Per-row historical model name** — [D09] commits to "current model wins for all replay-committed rows" in v1. A future refinement could surface per-row historical model when the JSONL records different models across the session's lifetime. Earned when sessions routinely span model versions and users notice.
