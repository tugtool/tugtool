## Tide Connection Health & Reconnect-Aware Cards {#tide-connection-health}

**Purpose:** Make Tide cards survive a tugcast restart and a half-open WebSocket *with submit always working at the end of the cycle*. Introduce a `ConnectionLifecycle` abstraction parallel to `AppLifecycle` and `CardLifecycle`; add a client-side heartbeat watchdog and a transport-state axis on the per-card store; and fix the server-side session-recovery path so resume after `pkill -x tugcast` actually succeeds end-to-end.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

Two coupled defects surfaced in real use of Tide:

1. **Tide cards have trouble reconnecting after a tugcast restart.** When the WebSocket comes back up, tide cards stay unbound. Submitting a command spins forever, with no visible signal that anything is wrong.
2. **Connection failures are not always detected.** `pkill -x tugcast` does not reliably surface the disconnection banner. The app sometimes reconnects on its own, but every existing tide card is broken without showing it.

Tracing these symptoms surfaces three coupled root causes:

- **`restoreTideSessions` runs once at startup, never on reconnect.** `tugdeck/src/main.tsx:228` calls it once after `tugbankClient.ready()`. There is no companion `connection.onOpen(...)` for subsequent opens. After a tugcast restart, the server's `rebind_from_tugbank` rebuilds ledger entries from `dev.tugtool.tide.session-keys`, but the client never re-asserts them with `spawn_session(mode=resume)`. The bindings the client holds in `cardSessionBindingStore` no longer correspond to anything live on the new server's side, and frame routing fails silently.
- **The client has no heartbeat watchdog.** The server has one — `tugcast/src/router.rs` enforces `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT = 45 s`. The client only *sends* heartbeats; it never validates that the server's heartbeats are arriving. If TCP goes half-open (process hung, OS sleep, broken proxy), the WebSocket's `onclose` may not fire for hours, until OS-level keepalive expires.
- **The transport-state / per-card lifecycle is incomplete.** `code-session-store.ts:155` already subscribes to `connection.onClose` and dispatches `transport_close`, but the reducer drops it silently for `idle` cards (`reducer.ts:737`). There is no companion `transport_open` event to recover. The banner has its own 2 s show-debounce (`tug-banner-bridge.tsx:22`) that often elapses *after* a quick reconnect, so brief outages flash invisibly.

This plan fixes all three by introducing a `ConnectionLifecycle` abstraction (the foundational deliverable; every subsequent step subscribes through it), a client-side watchdog driven by lifecycle state, a `lastPayload` snapshot-cache clear on close, an orthogonal transport-state axis on the per-card store that the UI gates on, and — crucially — a tugcast-side fix so `spawn_session(mode=resume)` after a kill actually succeeds rather than failing with `crash_budget_exhausted`.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **Lifecycle abstraction first, behavior on top.** Step 1's foundational deliverable is `ConnectionLifecycle` — named events (`connectionDidOpen`, `connectionDidReconnect`, `connectionDidClose`, etc.) parallel to the existing `AppLifecycle` and `CardLifecycle`. Every subsequent client-side step in this plan subscribes through the lifecycle; no step uses bare `connection.onOpen` / `connection.onClose` callbacks. The lifecycle owns the close-then-open gating that distinguishes "wire is alive" from "wire is alive *again*", so subscribers never re-derive it (and never get it wrong, as a per-store first-flag does).
- **End-to-end submit-works is the bar.** The success criterion is "submit always works after `pkill -x tugcast`" — not "binding re-asserts" or "banner shows up." A properly functioning reconnection scheme delivers full restoration. Step 8 is dedicated to fixing the server-side `crash_budget_exhausted` path so the resume frame the client now sends actually completes successfully on tugcast's side.
- **Transport state is orthogonal to phase.** Phase is *turn lifecycle*; transport is *wire health*. Two independent axes. Conflating them produces bad UX during reconnects ("errored" cards that nothing was submitted on; cards refusing retry when the wire is back) and leaks across tests.
- **Lifecycle layer emits; reducer owns transitions.** Per-card stores translate lifecycle events into store-level events (`transport_close`, `transport_open`, `transport_settled`). The lifecycle is the action source; the store reducer is the responder. Mirrors [L11].
- **Watchdog mirrors the server's contract.** The 45 s threshold is the same `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` the server already uses to time *us* out. The watchdog is a defensive copy of an existing constraint, not a new one.
- **Build stays green at every commit.** `bun x tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, `bun run audit:tokens lint`, and `cargo nextest run` pass on every step. Warnings are errors.
- **App-test recipes where feasible; manual where not.** Kill+restart and rapid-cycle scenarios become `app-test` recipes. OS sleep / wake stays manual.
- **Tuglaws cross-checked.** Every step that touches the connection layer, the per-card store, or the banner re-checks against [tuglaws.md](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md). The closing step records the walkthrough.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- **Submit always works after `pkill -x tugcast`.** After the kill and tugcast respawn, every tide card that was bound before the kill rebinds *and* a freshly-typed `> hi` reaches Claude and streams a response — without a page reload. (Verified by app-test recipe and manual smoke. Step 1 delivers binding re-assertion; Step 8 delivers server-side resume reliability so the resume frame succeeds end-to-end.)
- `ConnectionLifecycle` exposes named events (`connectionDidOpen`, `connectionDidReconnect`, `connectionDidClose`, `connectionDidEnterReconnecting`, `connectionWillOpen`) and a `getState()` query. All in-tree callers of connection events subscribe through the lifecycle; bare `connection.onOpen` / `connection.onClose` callable APIs are removed by Step 5. (Verified by `grep`-able codebase + unit tests on the lifecycle's gating behavior.)
- A half-open WebSocket where no frames arrive for ≥ 45 s causes the client to force-close and reconnect. (Verified by unit test on the watchdog timer; manual smoke via OS sleep / wake.)
- `transportState` transitions are observable in the per-card snapshot: `online → offline` on close, `offline → restoring` on next open, `restoring → online` when the binding lands. (Verified by reducer unit tests.)
- `canSubmit` is gated on `transportState === "online"` in addition to phase. (Verified by snapshot test; manual smoke disables the submit button visibly during a kill+restart cycle.)
- The disconnect banner appears within ≤ 1 s of a connection loss (was: up to 2 s due to debounce). (Verified by app-test recipe.)
- After a visible disconnect, a transient "Reconnected" affordance shows for ≤ 1.5 s on recovery. (Verified by manual smoke.)
- `lastPayload` is empty after `connectionDidClose`; a late `onFrame` registration after reconnect does not deliver any pre-close frame. (Verified by unit test.)

#### Scope {#scope}

1. **`ConnectionLifecycle` abstraction** (new file, parallel to `app-lifecycle.ts` / `card-lifecycle.ts`): named events, `notify*` / `observe*` pairs, `getState()` query, module-level singleton via `register*` / `get*`. Owns the close-then-open gating that distinguishes `connectionDidReconnect` from a bare `connectionDidOpen`.
2. **`TugConnection` drives the lifecycle** at four well-defined transitions (`will-open`, `did-open`, `did-close`, `did-enter-reconnecting`).
3. Reconnect-aware `restoreTideSessions` driven by `connectionLifecycle.observeConnectionDidReconnect`.
4. Client-side heartbeat watchdog inside `TugConnection` that force-closes on `lastFrameAt` staleness, gated on lifecycle state.
5. `lastPayload` snapshot-cache clear on `connectionDidClose`.
6. New `transportState: "online" | "offline" | "restoring"` field on `CodeSessionState` and on `CodeSessionSnapshot`.
7. New `transport_open` event; rework of `transport_close` so it sets `transportState` for *every* phase (no longer dropped for `idle`).
8. `code-session-store` migrates to `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidClose` / `observeConnectionDidReconnect`; bare `connection.onOpen` / `connection.onClose` callable APIs are removed.
9. `MockTugConnection` migrates: lifecycle events come from a real `ConnectionLifecycle` driven directly by tests; the mock shrinks to transport-only.
10. UI gating on `transportState`: `canSubmit` becomes `phase ∈ {idle, errored} && transportState === "online"`; `TideCardContent` renders `TideRestoring` while `transportState === "restoring"`.
11. Banner UX tightening: shorter / removed disconnect debounce; transient "Reconnected" affordance; "Restoring sessions…" status while any card is in `restoring`.
12. **Server-side fix for `crash_budget_exhausted` after `pkill -x tugcast`** so the resume frame the client now sends actually completes successfully on tugcast's side. Investigation-driven; specific subtasks land after Step 8's spike.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- A server-pushed `client_recognized { sessions: [...] }` frame so the client doesn't have to ask. See [D03].
- Folding `transportState` into the existing `phase` enum. See [D01].
- Rewriting `TugConnection`'s reconnect/backoff strategy. The watchdog reuses the existing `ws.close()` → `scheduleReconnect()` path.
- Persisting transport state across page reloads. Transport state is in-memory only; on reload, every store starts at `online` and the normal `restoreTideSessions` path runs.
- Adding new client→server wire frames in Steps 1–7. Step 8 *may* introduce server-side state changes inside tugcast, but the wire shape between tugdeck and tugcast is unchanged.
- Reworking the picker, the session ledger, or any other Step-10-and-later work in `tugplan-tide-card-polish.md`. Those are independent.
- A `useConnectionLifecycle` React hook. Lifecycle subscribers in this plan are all module-scope (lifecycle events drive store state which React reads through the existing `useSyncExternalStore` paths). A hook can be added in a follow-on if a UI component needs to subscribe directly.

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- Existing `spawn_session(mode=resume)` plumbing from [T3.4.c Step 4i](./archive/tugplan-tide-card.md#step-4i) and the picker work in [Step 4.5](./archive/tugplan-tide-card.md#step-4-5).
- **Existing `AppLifecycle` (`tugdeck/src/lib/app-lifecycle.ts`) and `CardLifecycle` (`tugdeck/src/lib/card-lifecycle.ts`) as the templates `ConnectionLifecycle` mirrors.** Same naming convention (`{notify,observe}{will,did}<Event>`), same module-level singleton pattern, same dev-mode trace-log toggle.
- Existing `cardSessionBindingStore` and `tideRestoreRegistry` modules (`tugdeck/src/lib/card-session-binding-store.ts`, `tugdeck/src/lib/tide-session-restore.ts`).
- Existing `code-session-store` reducer + effect-list architecture ([D11] in T3.4.c).
- Existing `TugBanner` primitive and `tug-banner-bridge.tsx` provider.
- Tugcast supervisor + agent-spawn code paths in `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` (Step 8 investigation surface).

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- **Tuglaws** [L02], [L03], [L11], [L23] apply at every step. See [#tuglaws-cross-check].
- **No warnings**: `cargo build` / `cargo nextest run` enforce `-D warnings` (CLAUDE.md build policy).
- **HMR is always running**: never run a manual tugdeck build; HMR picks up changes on save (`feedback_hmr` memory).
- **Use bun, not npm**: every tooling invocation is `bun ...` (`feedback_use_bun` memory).
- **No mock-store assertion tests**: reducer unit tests dispatch through the real store, not via hand-rolled mock interfaces (`feedback_no_mock_store_tests` memory).
- **app-test recipes use `just app-test <file>`**: never hand-rolled `bun test` with `TUGAPP_*` env vars (`feedback_just_app_test` memory).

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The 15 s server-side `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` and the 45 s `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` from `tugcast/src/router.rs` are stable and authoritative. If either changes, the watchdog threshold tracks the server's `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`.
- Snapshot frames are server-authoritative and replayed on every reconnect handshake. Clearing `lastPayload` on close cannot lose any client-authoritative state.
- `restoreTideSessions` is idempotent across multiple invocations once Step 1 lands; concurrent restore attempts collapse cleanly because `cardSessionBindingStore.clearAll()` precedes each run.
- A card's transcript (already accumulated `TurnEntry` rows) is preserved across transport flips. Only `transportState`, the inflight buffers, and gating change.

### Reference and Anchor Conventions (MANDATORY) {#reference-conventions}

This plan follows [tuglaws/tugplan-skeleton.md §reference-conventions](../tuglaws/tugplan-skeleton.md#reference-conventions). Key points:

- All execution-step anchors are kebab-case `step-N`.
- Design decisions use `dNN-...` slugs.
- `**References:**` lines cite specific decisions, specs, lists, and anchors — never line numbers.
- `**Depends on:**` lines cite step anchors, never titles or numbers.

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

> The three open questions on the source [step-7-5](./tugplan-tide-card-polish.md#step-7-5) sketch were promoted to design decisions during plan authoring. See [D01], [D02], [D03]. One additional question is open at plan-author time and is the gate before Step 8 lands.

#### [Q01] Root cause of `crash_budget_exhausted` after `pkill -x tugcast` (OPEN) {#q01-crash-budget-root-cause}

**Question:** After `pkill -x tugcast` and tugcast respawn, the client correctly fires `spawn_session(mode=resume)` — but tugcast responds with `SESSION_STATE: errored detail=crash_budget_exhausted`. Why does the new tugcast process fail to spawn the underlying claude subprocess for the recovered session, repeatedly enough to exhaust its retry budget?

**Why it matters:** Until this is answered and fixed, success criterion #1 ("submit always works after `pkill -x tugcast`") cannot be met. Step 1's reconnect work proved the binding does re-assert; the failure is now downstream on the server.

**Hypotheses to investigate (Step 8's spike):**
- The previous claude subprocess held an open file handle on the per-session JSONL transcript; on `pkill -9`-style termination the JSONL was left in a state the new claude process refuses to resume from.
- The previous tugcode bridge process is orphaned (not killed by `pkill -x tugcast` — only tugcast itself is killed) and is still holding a lock or socket the new tugcast can't supersede.
- Tugcast's `spawn_session(mode=resume)` re-uses the previous `tug_session_id` but allocates a fresh worker; if the worker spawn flow assumes a clean `claude_session_id` and the previous one is still referenced somewhere, the spawn loops.
- A real crash budget that's correctly reporting a real spawn failure that needs a code fix in claude/tugcode/tugcast subprocess management.

**Plan to resolve:** Step 8 begins with a directed spike: instrument `agent_supervisor.rs` to log every spawn attempt's exit reason, reproduce the kill+restart locally, read the actual exit signal / stderr / lock state. Once the failure mode is concrete, scope the fix.

**Resolution:** OPEN — must be answered as Step 8's first deliverable. The fix is whatever the spike reveals.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Transport-state introduces a new dimension to test | med | high | Default `transportState = "online"`; existing tests stay green; explicit transport tests cover the new dimension | A flaky reducer test correlates with a transport event |
| Watchdog mis-fires under legitimate idle wires | med | low | Threshold mirrors server's `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`; any drift past 45 s is already a real problem | Telemetry shows force-closes without other failure signals |
| Reconnect can stack restores | low | low | `restoreTideSessions` is idempotent; binding-clear before each run; per-card 10 s timeout | Logs show overlapping `restore.fired_resume_spawns` events |
| `lastPayload` cache clear loses a snapshot frame | low | low | Snapshot path is server-authoritative; post-reconnect handshake replays | A late subscriber renders empty after reconnect |
| Banner UX change feels noisy | low | med | Keep "Reconnected" ≤ 1.5 s; only on recovery from a *visible* disconnect | User feedback or design review flags noise |
| Step 8 spike reveals the fix is larger than this plan can absorb | high | med | Step 8 starts with a time-boxed spike; if the fix lands in claude/tugcode rather than tugcast, scope the smallest tugcast-side mitigation that satisfies success criterion #1 and file the deeper fix as a follow-on | Spike runs > 2 days without a concrete fix path |

**Risk R01: Watchdog false-positive force-close** {#r01-watchdog-false-positive}

- **Risk:** A legitimately quiet wire (no traffic for > 45 s) gets force-closed by the watchdog.
- **Mitigation:** The server emits a HEARTBEAT every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL = 15 s` (`router.rs:45`). `lastFrameAt` bumps on *any* incoming frame, including HEARTBEAT. The 45 s threshold tolerates two missed heartbeats. If three consecutive heartbeats don't arrive, the wire is genuinely broken — the same conclusion the server would reach about us.
- **Residual risk:** A pathological network path that delivers heartbeats in a 50 s+ burst would cause a force-close. Acceptable; that path is already broken from the server's perspective.

**Risk R02: Reconnect-stack from rapid `onOpen` fires** {#r02-reconnect-stack}

- **Risk:** A flaky network where `onOpen` fires twice within the time it takes a `spawn_session(resume)` round-trip causes two restore runs to interleave.
- **Mitigation:** `restoreTideSessions` is idempotent (it clears in-flight expectations and re-arms via `tideRestoreRegistry._clear` then `_register`); Step 1 inserts `cardSessionBindingStore.clearAll()` before each run; the per-card 10 s timeout in `tideRestoreRegistry` cleans up stuck restores.
- **Residual risk:** Two `spawn_session(resume)` frames could land back-to-back on the server. The server's existing dedupe on `tug_session_id` collapses them to one bind.

**Risk R03: ~~`transport_open` dispatched on initial mount~~** (RETIRED) {#r03-initial-open-dispatch}

> **Retired by [D09].** The original framing assumed per-store flags (`_seenFirstOpen`) would gate the spurious-mount dispatch. That framing was wrong on two counts: (1) `connection.onOpen` doesn't fire callbacks for handshakes that already completed before registration, so the "first invocation = mount path" assumption was false; (2) the gating belongs at the lifecycle layer, not duplicated in every subscriber. `ConnectionLifecycle` now centralizes the close-then-open gating: subscribers use `observeConnectionDidReconnect` (fires only on recovery) or `observeConnectionDidOpen` (fires on every open). No per-store flags. No spurious mount-path dispatch is possible by construction.

**Risk R04: Step 8 spike reveals a fix beyond this plan's natural scope** {#r04-spike-overruns}

- **Risk:** The `crash_budget_exhausted` root cause may live in claude / tugcode / OS-level subprocess management rather than tugcast itself, and an honest fix might require changes too large for this plan to absorb in one branch.
- **Mitigation:** Step 8 begins with a time-boxed spike (target: 1–2 days). If the spike concludes that the proper fix is out-of-scope, fall back to the smallest tugcast-side mitigation that still satisfies success criterion #1 — for example, a clean-state recovery path where tugcast detects the unrecoverable session, marks it abandoned in the ledger, and the client's existing `resume_failed` UX flips the picker into a fresh-session bind. The deeper fix files as a follow-on plan against tugcast and claude.
- **Residual risk:** The fallback path loses transcript continuity for the user (a fresh session means a fresh JSONL). This is strictly better than the current behavior (errored card with no path forward) and matches the user's existing "close and reopen the card to retry" affordance, but it is not the ideal end state.

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

> Record *decisions* (not options). Each decision includes the "why" so later phases don't reopen it accidentally.

#### [D01] `transportState` is a separate field, orthogonal to `phase` (DECIDED) {#d01-transport-state-separate}

**Decision:** Add `transportState: "online" | "offline" | "restoring"` as a new field on `CodeSessionState` and `CodeSessionSnapshot`, alongside the existing `phase` enum. Do not fold transport health into `phase` (e.g., as `transport_lost` or `restoring` phase values).

**Rationale:**
- Phase is about *turn lifecycle*: interrupting, queuing, errored from the wire's perspective. Transport is about *wire health*: did we lose the connection? Are we mid-handshake on a re-open?
- Conflating them produces bad UX: cards say "errored" when nothing was submitted; cards refuse retry when the wire is back.
- Conflating them leaks across tests: every existing per-phase test would have to re-establish a transport invariant. Separate fields keep each test focused.

**Implications:**
- The reducer handles four `transport_*` events orthogonally to phase events. Most phase-event handlers do not read `transportState`.
- `canSubmit` becomes `(phase ∈ {idle, errored}) && (transportState === "online")` — a conjunction across two axes.
- Existing tests with no transport dispatch keep passing; default value is `"online"`.

#### [D02] Watchdog timeout matches the server's `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` (DECIDED) {#d02-watchdog-mirrors-server}

**Decision:** The client watchdog force-closes the WebSocket if `Date.now() - lastFrameAt > HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` where `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS = 45_000`. This mirrors `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` in `tugcast/src/router.rs:48`. The watchdog timer ticks every 5 s.

**Rationale:**
- The server already uses 45 s to time *us* out. Any drift past 45 s is already a real problem from the server's perspective; the client adopting the same threshold is a defensive copy of an existing contract, not a new constraint.
- The server emits HEARTBEAT every 15 s. 45 s = three missed heartbeats — clear evidence the wire is broken, not just quiet.
- Picking a slightly longer threshold (e.g., 50 s) to absorb clock skew adds latency to recovery without reducing false-positive rate; the 5 s tick already absorbs most jitter.

**Implications:**
- A `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` constant in `connection.ts` carries an explicit comment that mirrors `router.rs`.
- Tests mock `Date.now` and the watchdog timer; do not depend on real timers.
- If `router.rs` ever changes the timeout, the client constant must change in lockstep. A unit-test assertion on both crates can enforce this if desired (out of scope here).

#### [D03] Defer server-pushed `client_recognized` frame to a follow-up (DECIDED) {#d03-defer-server-push}

**Decision:** Do not introduce a server-pushed `client_recognized { sessions: [...] }` frame as part of this plan. The client-driven re-restore (Step 1) is sufficient on its own. A server-push path can be added as defense-in-depth in a later plan if the client-driven path proves insufficient.

**Rationale:**
- Client-driven re-restore is one frame per card, sent after `connection.onOpen`. The server already handles `spawn_session(mode=resume)` deduping by `tug_session_id`. Round-trip cost is bounded by the number of live tide cards (typically 1–4).
- Server-pushed recognition is a larger architectural change: it requires a new control frame type, server-side tracking of "what does this client know about?", and conflict resolution between server-pushed and client-pulled views.
- Adding it now ties this plan's blast radius across the wire boundary; deferring keeps the plan tugdeck-only.

**Implications:**
- This plan does not touch tugcast.
- A future "server-side session recognition" plan can build on top once we know whether client-driven recovery has gaps in production use.

#### [D04] Reconnect-aware restore clears bindings before re-running (DECIDED) {#d04-clear-then-restore}

**Decision:** On every `connectionDidReconnect`, the reconnect handler calls `cardSessionBindingStore.clearAll()` and *then* calls `restoreTideSessions(..., { reason: "reconnect" })`. The clear-then-restore order is part of the contract.

**Rationale:**
- Bindings without a live server peer are worse than no bindings: workspace-key filters in `FeedStore` route frames the new server is not actually emitting, and `useCardWorkspaceKey` reads stale data.
- Clearing first guarantees that any UI that observes the binding store sees a clean "no binding yet" state before the next `spawn_session_ok` ack arrives.
- The clear+restore pair is atomic from the React store-subscriber's perspective: a single `clearAll` notify, then per-card `setBinding` notifies as acks arrive.

**Implications:**
- `CardSessionBindingStore` gains a `clearAll()` method that emits a single notify (not N notifies for N entries).
- `restoreTideSessions` accepts a `{ reason: "reconnect" }` flag (or equivalent) so its lifecycle log distinguishes startup from reconnect runs.
- Cards observing the binding store will see at least one render with no binding between `clearAll` and the first `setBinding`. The UI's `transportState === "restoring"` rendering covers this gap (see [D06]).
- The handler is registered via `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidReconnect(...)` per [D09]; the lifecycle's [D08] gating guarantees it never fires on the initial mount path.

#### [D05] `lastPayload` snapshot cache clears on `onclose` (DECIDED) {#d05-clear-last-payload-on-close}

**Decision:** `TugConnection.lastPayload.clear()` runs in the `onclose` handler before any reconnect logic. Late `onFrame` subscribers registered after a reconnect do not receive any pre-close frame.

**Rationale:**
- The cache is the "replay snapshot to late subscribers" mechanism. After a close, any cached frame from before the close is no longer authoritative — the server's post-reconnect handshake will replay whatever is current.
- Without this clear, a card mounted post-reconnect (e.g., a deferred `card-host` mount) could observe a stale `SESSION_STATE` frame that no longer reflects the new server's view.
- The snapshot path is server-authoritative; there is no client-authoritative state in the cache that needs preserving across the close.

**Implications:**
- A snapshot frame that arrives in the narrow window between the last `dispatch` and `onclose` is discarded. This is acceptable: the post-reconnect snapshot will replay it.
- Tests assert `lastPayload.size === 0` after `onclose`.

#### [D06] `transport_close` sets `transportState` for every phase (DECIDED) {#d06-transport-close-not-dropped}

**Decision:** The reducer's `transport_close` handler sets `transportState = "offline"` for every phase, including `idle`. The current "drop silently when idle" behavior is removed.

**Rationale:**
- The current drop was correct under the old assumption that `phase` was the only state. Under [D01] there is now an orthogonal axis where transport health matters even when no turn is in flight.
- An `idle` card that loses the wire still needs to show "offline" gating: the user should not be able to submit until the wire is back.
- The phase transition to `errored` is preserved for non-idle phases; transport-state is set in addition to (not instead of) the phase change.

**Implications:**
- Two reducer tests (`reducer.test.ts:588` and `code-session-store.errored.test.ts:124`) need their assertions updated to reflect the new "always sets transportState" behavior.
- The `lastError.cause = "transport_closed"` path stays the same for non-idle phases.

#### [D07] Lifecycle emits connection events; per-card stores translate to store events (DECIDED) {#d07-lifecycle-emits-stores-translate}

**Decision:** `TugConnection` calls `connectionLifecycle.notify*` at four well-defined transitions (`will-open`, `did-open`, `did-close`, `did-enter-reconnecting`). `CodeSessionStore` and other per-card stores subscribe via `connectionLifecycle.observeConnectionDidClose` / `observeConnectionDidReconnect` and translate those into store-level events (`transport_close`, `transport_open`, `transport_settled`). The store reducer is the sole owner of the `transportState` value. No store subscribes to `TugConnection` directly.

**Rationale:**
- Mirrors [L11]: "Controls emit actions; responders own state that actions operate on." `ConnectionLifecycle` is the action source; the store reducer is the responder.
- Keeps `TugConnection` free of any per-card store knowledge.
- Keeps `ConnectionLifecycle` a pure event pipe (no I/O, no per-card knowledge), which lets tests drive the lifecycle directly without faking the connection.
- Provides a single place that names the events: a reader of `code-session-store.ts:155` sees `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidClose(() => dispatch({type: "transport_close"}))` and immediately understands the contract — versus a bare `conn.onClose` callback that requires reading WebSocket lifecycle docs to interpret.

**Implications:**
- `code-session-store.ts` migrates from `conn.onClose` to `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidClose` and adds `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidReconnect` for the `transport_open` dispatch (Step 5).
- Future transport-aware stores (e.g., `card-services-store`) follow the same pattern.
- Tests use a real `ConnectionLifecycle` and call `notify*` directly. `MockTugConnection` no longer needs to fake transport-event registration (Step 5).

#### [D08] `connectionDidReconnect` requires both a prior successful open AND a close since (DECIDED) {#d08-reconnect-gating}

**Decision:** `ConnectionLifecycle.notifyConnectionDidOpen` fires `connectionDidReconnect` iff *both* (a) a previous `notifyConnectionDidOpen` has fired successfully on this lifecycle instance (`everOpened === true`) and (b) `notifyConnectionDidClose` has fired since the last open (`sawCloseSinceLastOpen === true`). Both flags are owned by the lifecycle; subscribers never re-derive the gating.

**Rationale:**
- The semantic of `connectionDidReconnect` is "the wire is alive *again*" — explicitly distinct from "the wire is alive" (`connectionDidOpen`). Both flags are required to capture this:
  - `everOpened` rules out the case where the very first connect attempt closes before its handshake completes (rare — handshake protocol/version mismatch in `connection.ts:117-145`); the next successful open is then the *first* real open of the lifecycle, not a recovery.
  - `sawCloseSinceLastOpen` rules out spurious double-fires (a stray duplicate `did-open` event).
- Centralizing the gating in the lifecycle layer is the architectural fix for the bug that broke Step 1's first attempt: a per-store "first invocation" flag was wrong because callbacks registered after the handshake never see a true first invocation. The lifecycle, which owns the truth, doesn't have that problem.
- Subscribers that want "do this work on every recovery" use `observeConnectionDidReconnect`. Subscribers that want "do this work on every open including the initial mount" use `observeConnectionDidOpen`. Two named events, two clear semantics.

**Implications:**
- The lifecycle is the only place the gating logic lives. `connection-lifecycle.test.ts` covers all the corner cases (mount path, reconnect after established connection, close-before-first-successful-open, multiple closes between opens, multiple opens after one close).
- No subscriber needs a per-store `_seenFirstOpen` field. Step 5's `code-session-store` migration deletes that pattern outright; it never lands in production.
- Future transport-aware abstractions (per-card stores, banner) can subscribe to lifecycle events without re-implementing the gating.

#### [D09] `ConnectionLifecycle` is the canonical surface for connection events (DECIDED) {#d09-lifecycle-canonical}

**Decision:** All in-tree consumers of WebSocket connection events subscribe through `ConnectionLifecycle.observe*`. The bare `connection.onOpen(callback)` and `connection.onClose(callback)` callable APIs on `TugConnection` are removed by the end of Step 5. The lifecycle is the *only* public surface for connection events; `TugConnection` itself is treated as transport-only.

**Rationale:**
- Two parallel event APIs (lifecycle observers + bare callbacks) is one too many. Drift between them creates exactly the kind of "which gating logic applies here?" confusion that broke the original Step 1 attempt.
- `AppLifecycle` and `CardLifecycle` already established this pattern: there is no parallel `app.onWillBecomeActive(callback)` API on the underlying message-channel — `useAppDelegate` and `observeApplication*` are the surface. `ConnectionLifecycle` should match.
- Removing the bare APIs forces every event-name choice to surface in the lifecycle's vocabulary, which is reviewable and easy to grep for.

**Implications:**
- Step 1 introduces the lifecycle and migrates `main.tsx`'s `signalReady` from `connection.onOpen` to `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidOpen`.
- Step 5 migrates the last remaining caller (`code-session-store.ts:155`'s `conn.onClose`) and removes `TugConnection.onOpen` and `TugConnection.onClose` from the public API.
- `MockTugConnection` no longer exposes `onClose`; tests construct a real `ConnectionLifecycle` and drive `lifecycle.notify*` directly.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### Connection Lifecycle Contract {#connection-lifecycle-contract}

`ConnectionLifecycle` (`tugdeck/src/lib/connection-lifecycle.ts`) is parallel to `AppLifecycle` and `CardLifecycle`: a stateless event pipe with named events, `notify*` / `observe*` pairs, a state query, and a module-level singleton.

**Five events:**

| Event | Fires when | Owner of the truth |
|-|-|-|
| `connectionWillOpen` | TCP connection made; protocol handshake in progress | `TugConnection.ws.onopen` |
| `connectionDidOpen` | Handshake response accepted; wire is alive. Fires on initial open AND every reconnect. | `TugConnection` post-handshake branch |
| `connectionDidReconnect` | A `connectionDidOpen` that *followed* a prior `connectionDidClose`, AND a prior successful open exists. Subset of `connectionDidOpen`. | Lifecycle internal gating (see [D08]) |
| `connectionDidClose` | WebSocket lost: server-initiated close, network error, or intentional `close()` | `TugConnection.ws.onclose` |
| `connectionDidEnterReconnecting` | Backoff timer scheduled after a close, awaiting next attempt | `TugConnection.scheduleReconnect()` |

**State machine:**

```
       connectionWillOpen          connectionDidOpen

                                                        ▼
                                                     opening
                                                        │ connectionDidOpen
                                                        ▼
                                                     open  + connectionDidReconnect (if everOpened)
```

**Public API (Spec S00):** {#s00-connection-lifecycle-api}

```ts
export type ConnectionState = "closed" | "opening" | "open" | "reconnecting";
export type ConnectionLifecycleObserver = () => void;

export class ConnectionLifecycle {
  // State query
  getState(): ConnectionState;
  isOpen(): boolean;

  // Notify (called by TugConnection)
  notifyConnectionWillOpen(): void;
  notifyConnectionDidOpen(): void;
  notifyConnectionDidClose(): void;
  notifyConnectionDidEnterReconnecting(): void;

  // Observe (called by subscribers)
  observeConnectionWillOpen(cb: ConnectionLifecycleObserver): () => void;
  observeConnectionDidOpen(cb: ConnectionLifecycleObserver): () => void;
  observeConnectionDidReconnect(cb: ConnectionLifecycleObserver): () => void;
  observeConnectionDidClose(cb: ConnectionLifecycleObserver): () => void;
  observeConnectionDidEnterReconnecting(cb: ConnectionLifecycleObserver): () => void;
}

// Module-level singleton (mirrors registerAppLifecycle)
export function registerConnectionLifecycle(lifecycle: ConnectionLifecycle | null): void;
export function getConnectionLifecycle(): ConnectionLifecycle | null;
```

**Gating semantics ([D08]):** `connectionDidReconnect` fires only when both `everOpened === true` and `sawCloseSinceLastOpen === true`. The lifecycle owns these flags; subscribers never see them or re-derive them. Tests in `connection-lifecycle.test.ts` pin every corner case (mount path, reconnect, close-before-first-successful-open, double opens, double closes).

**Production wiring (`main.tsx`):**

```ts
export const connectionLifecycle = new ConnectionLifecycle();
connection.setLifecycle(connectionLifecycle);
registerConnectionLifecycle(connectionLifecycle);
```

The lifecycle is attached *before* `connection.connect()` runs, so the very first handshake fires `connectionDidOpen` through it.

**Production subscribers (post-Step 5):**

| Subscriber | Event | What it does |
|-|-|-|
| `main.tsx` | `connectionDidOpen` | `signalReady()` — frontendReady postMessage to native host |
| `main.tsx` | `connectionDidReconnect` | `clearAll()` then `restoreTideSessions(reason="reconnect")` |
| `code-session-store.ts` (per card) | `connectionDidClose` | dispatch `{type: "transport_close"}` |
| `code-session-store.ts` (per card) | `connectionDidReconnect` | dispatch `{type: "transport_open"}` |
| `tug-banner-bridge.tsx` | `connectionDidClose`, `connectionDidEnterReconnecting`, `connectionDidOpen` | Banner show/hide and "Reconnected" affordance |

#### Transport-State Lifecycle {#transport-state-lifecycle}

The state machine for `transportState`:

```
                    transport_close            transport_close
                   ┌──────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────┐
                   ▼                  │       ▼                  │
              ┌─────────┐    transport_open    ┌────────────┐    │

                   ▲                                │         │ │
                   │ transport_close                │ binding-arrived
                   │ (from any state)               ▼         │ │
              ┌─────────┐                       ┌────────┐    │ │
              │  online │ ◀───────────────────  │ online │ ───┘ │
              └─────────┘                       └────────┘      │
                                                                │
              (default at construct)                            │
                                                                │
               (transport_close from any state) ────────────────┘
```

Transitions:

| From → To | Event | Notes |
|-|-|-|
| any → `offline` | `transport_close` | Always sets state. [D06] |
| `offline` → `restoring` | `transport_open` | Wire is back; spawn_session(resume) ack pending. |
| `restoring` → `online` | binding-arrived effect | The `cardSessionBindingStore` gained a binding for this card. |
| `online` → `online` | `transport_open` | No-op. [D08] |
| `online` → `restoring` | `transport_open` | Defensive — if a `transport_close` was missed (shouldn't happen in normal flow). |

**Spec S01: transport-state event vocabulary** {#s01-transport-events}

```ts
// events.ts additions
type Event =
  | ...existing
  | { type: "transport_close" }              // existing, behavior changes per [D06]
  | { type: "transport_open" }               // NEW, [D07]
  | { type: "transport_settled" };           // NEW, dispatched on binding-arrived [D04]
```

`transport_settled` is the explicit "the binding for this card landed" event. It's dispatched by the existing `cardSessionBindingStore` subscription path in `tide-session-restore.ts`, which already runs after `spawn_session_ok` populates the binding. The reducer treats `transport_settled` as `transportState = "online"` regardless of prior state.

#### Watchdog Contract {#watchdog-contract}

**Spec S02: client-side heartbeat watchdog** {#s02-watchdog}

```ts
// connection.ts additions
private lastFrameAt: number = Date.now();
private watchdogTimer: number | null = null;

private startWatchdog(): void {
  this.watchdogTimer = window.setInterval(() => {
    if (Date.now() - this.lastFrameAt > HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS) {
      console.warn("tugdeck: heartbeat watchdog firing — force-closing stale wire");
      this.ws?.close();
    }
  }, WATCHDOG_TICK_MS);
}

// In onmessage (any frame, including HEARTBEAT echo):
this.lastFrameAt = Date.now();
```

Constants:

| Name | Value | Source |
|-|-|-|
| `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `45_000` | mirrors `router.rs:48` `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT` |
| `WATCHDOG_TICK_MS` | `5_000` | absorbs jitter; small enough to detect within ~5 s of threshold |

Lifecycle:
- `startWatchdog()` runs in the same place as `startHeartbeat()` (after the handshake completes).
- `stopWatchdog()` runs in `stopHeartbeat()` (on close).
- `lastFrameAt` is bumped on every `onmessage` *after the handshake* — including the binary HEARTBEAT echo.

#### Banner UX {#banner-ux}

**Spec S03: banner timing changes** {#s03-banner-timing}

| State | Old timing | New timing |
|-|-|-|
| Disconnect detected | 2 s show-debounce | 0–250 ms show |
| Reconnect | banner hides on `disconnected: false` | banner shows "Reconnected ✓" for ≤ 1.5 s, then hides |
| Restoring sessions | (no equivalent) | banner shows "Restoring sessions…" while any card is in `restoring` |

The "Reconnected" affordance only fires if a banner was actually shown (i.e., on recovery from a *visible* disconnect). The silent-watchdog path — where the wire was broken but the user never saw a banner — does not flash a "Reconnected" message; the user wasn't told there was a problem, so don't tell them it's been fixed.

The "Restoring sessions…" status is a separate transient indicator, driven by the union of all per-card `transportState === "restoring"` states. It clears once every restoring card has flipped to `online` (or the per-card 10 s restore timeout has elapsed).

### Specification {#specification}

#### Public API Surface {#public-api}

**`ConnectionLifecycle` (`tugdeck/src/lib/connection-lifecycle.ts`, NEW):**

Full surface in [Spec S00](#s00-connection-lifecycle-api). Five `notify*` methods, five `observe*` methods, `getState()` / `isOpen()` queries, module-level `registerConnectionLifecycle` / `getConnectionLifecycle` singleton helpers.

**`TugConnection` (`tugdeck/src/connection.ts`):**

```ts
// NEW
setLifecycle(lifecycle: ConnectionLifecycle | null): void;
```

Removed (Step 5):

```ts
// REMOVED
onOpen(callback: () => void): void;
onClose(callback: () => void): () => void;
```

Internal additions for the watchdog (Step 2):
- `private lastFrameAt: number`
- `private watchdogTimer: number | null`
- `private startWatchdog()` / `private stopWatchdog()`

**`CardSessionBindingStore` (`tugdeck/src/lib/card-session-binding-store.ts`):**

```ts
// NEW
clearAll = (): void => { ... }
```

Emits a single notify. Replaces the entire `_bindings` map with an empty `Map`.

**`CodeSessionState` and `CodeSessionSnapshot` (`tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/types.ts`):**

```ts
// NEW
transportState: "online" | "offline" | "restoring";
```

Default value: `"online"`. Initial state from `createInitialState` includes the field.

**Snapshot:**
```ts
canSubmit: phase ∈ {idle, errored} && transportState === "online";
```

**`Event` (`tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/events.ts`):**

```ts
// NEW
| { type: "transport_open" }
| { type: "transport_settled" }
```

Existing `transport_close` keeps its name; reducer behavior changes per [D06].

**`restoreTideSessions` (`tugdeck/src/lib/tide-session-restore.ts`):**

```ts
// signature unchanged but body becomes idempotent
export function restoreTideSessions(
  deck: DeckManager,
  tugbank: TugbankClient,
  connection: TugConnection,
  opts?: { reason?: "startup" | "reconnect" },
): void
```

### Documentation Plan {#documentation-plan}

- [ ] Update [tuglaws/tuglaws.md](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md) reference list in `code-session-store` and `connection` headers if any new law-touching pattern emerges (none expected — this is a pure additive transport axis).
- [ ] Update [tuglaws/card-state-model.md](../tuglaws/card-state-model.md) §"State axes" to mention `transportState` alongside `phase`, with a one-paragraph note on orthogonality (per [D01]).
- [ ] Update [tugplan-tide-card-polish.md §step-7-5](./tugplan-tide-card-polish.md#step-7-5) to a one-line redirect to this plan (lands as part of Step 0).
- [ ] No README changes; this is internal architecture.

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Lifecycle unit** | Construct a real `ConnectionLifecycle`; drive `notify*` directly; assert state transitions, observer dispatch, gating semantics | All `connectionDidReconnect` corner cases; subscriber registration / unsubscribe / throw isolation |
| **Reducer unit** | Direct dispatch into the reducer; assert `transportState` and `lastError` transitions | All transport-event behaviors |
| **Connection unit** | Mock `WebSocket` and timers; assert watchdog force-closes; assert `lastPayload` cleared on close; assert `notify*` calls fire at the right transitions | Watchdog timing, snapshot-cache hygiene, lifecycle wiring |
| **Snapshot integration** | Drive a real `CodeSessionStore` against a real `ConnectionLifecycle`; trigger lifecycle events; assert `canSubmit` toggles correctly | Cross-axis gating (phase × transportState) |
| **Tugcast unit (Rust)** | `cargo nextest run` against tugcast — assert spawn-recovery behavior after simulated kill | Step 8's server-side fix |
| **App-test (`just app-test`)** | Run against the built app; observe DOM after kill+restart of tugcast | End-to-end reconnect round-trip incl. submit-works; banner fast-show |
| **Manual smoke** | OS-level scenarios that don't fit harnesses | Laptop-sleep half-open detection; subjective banner-UX review |

**Test seam:** With `ConnectionLifecycle` as a pure event pipe, tests almost never need a `TugConnection` fake. They construct a real `ConnectionLifecycle`, register subscribers, and drive `notify*` directly. The legacy `MockTugConnection.onClose` path is removed in Step 5 (per [D09]); existing tests that use it migrate to the lifecycle.

### Execution Steps {#execution-steps}

> Execution comes last. Each step is one commit. The build stays green at every commit. References are mandatory.

#### Step 0 — Land plan + redirect {#step-0}

<!-- Step 0 has no dependencies (it is the root) -->

**Commit:** `roadmap: add tide connection-health plan; redirect step 7.5`

**References:** [#strategy], [#context], [tugplan-tide-card-polish.md §step-7-5](./tugplan-tide-card-polish.md#step-7-5)

**Artifacts:**
- `roadmap/tugplan-tide-connection-health.md` (this document, new)
- `roadmap/tugplan-tide-card-polish.md` Step 7.5 reduced to a one-line pointer to this plan; the `{#step-7-5}` anchor stays so existing internal references resolve.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write this plan into `roadmap/`.
- [ ] Edit `tugplan-tide-card-polish.md` Step 7.5 to a redirect line; preserve the `{#step-7-5}` anchor.
- [ ] Verify all internal references in `tugplan-tide-card-polish.md` to `[Step 7.5](#step-7-5)` still resolve to the redirect.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Manual: open both files in the editor; confirm anchors resolve and the redirect line is unambiguous.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `grep -n "step-7-5" roadmap/tugplan-tide-card-polish.md` shows only the redirect line and the anchor.
- [ ] `git diff --stat` shows two files changed: the new plan and the parent plan's Step 7.5 redirect.

#### Step 1 — `ConnectionLifecycle` abstraction + reconnect-aware restore {#step-1}

**Depends on:** #step-0

**Commit:** `tugdeck: introduce ConnectionLifecycle; re-restore on reconnect`

**References:** [D04], [D07], [D08], [D09], Spec S00, Spec S01, (#connection-lifecycle-contract, #internal-architecture)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/connection-lifecycle.ts` (new) — `ConnectionLifecycle` class, `ConnectionState` type, `registerConnectionLifecycle` / `getConnectionLifecycle` module singleton helpers. Five `notify*` and five `observe*` methods per [Spec S00](#s00-connection-lifecycle-api). Internal `everOpened` + `sawCloseSinceLastOpen` flags for the `connectionDidReconnect` gating per [D08].
- `tugdeck/src/connection.ts` — add `setLifecycle(lifecycle)`. Fire `notifyConnectionWillOpen` in `ws.onopen`, `notifyConnectionDidOpen` after the handshake response, `notifyConnectionDidClose` in `ws.onclose`, `notifyConnectionDidEnterReconnecting` in `scheduleReconnect`. Lifecycle fires before the legacy `openCallbacks` / `closeCallbacks` so subscribers gating on `getState()` see consistent state. Legacy `onOpen` / `onClose` callable APIs are *not yet removed* — they have one remaining caller (`code-session-store.ts:155`); Step 5 migrates that and removes them per [D09].
- `tugdeck/src/lib/card-session-binding-store.ts` — add `clearAll()` with single notify; no-op when empty.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/tide-session-restore.ts` — accept `opts?: { reason?: "startup" | "reconnect" }`; thread `reason` into `logSessionLifecycle("restore.fired_resume_spawns", ...)`. Body remains idempotent across calls.
- `tugdeck/src/main.tsx` — construct `ConnectionLifecycle`, attach via `connection.setLifecycle(lifecycle)`, register as singleton via `registerConnectionLifecycle(lifecycle)` *before* `connection.connect()` runs. Migrate `signalReady` to `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidOpen(signalReady)`. Subscribe the reconnect handler via `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidReconnect(() => { cardSessionBindingStore.clearAll(); restoreTideSessions(deck, tugbankClient, connection, { reason: "reconnect" }); })`.
- `tugdeck/src/__tests__/connection-lifecycle.test.ts` (new) — exhaustive lifecycle tests; see Tests below.
- `tugdeck/src/__tests__/card-session-binding-store.test.ts` — append `clearAll` cases.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `connection-lifecycle.ts` with the full surface from [Spec S00](#s00-connection-lifecycle-api). Match `app-lifecycle.ts` shape (event sets keyed by event name, throw-isolated `fire`, dev-mode trace logs).
- [x] Implement the `[D08]` gating — `connectionDidReconnect` fires only when `everOpened === true` AND `sawCloseSinceLastOpen === true`. Both flags owned by the lifecycle.
- [x] Wire `TugConnection.setLifecycle` and the four `notify*` call sites. Lifecycle fires *before* the legacy callback arrays.
- [x] Add `clearAll` to `CardSessionBindingStore`.
- [x] Extend `restoreTideSessions` with `opts?: { reason?: "startup" | "reconnect" }`.
- [x] In `main.tsx`, construct + attach + register the lifecycle, migrate `signalReady`, register the reconnect handler. Confirm lifecycle is attached *before* `connection.connect()` so the very first handshake fires through it.
- [x] Verify the legacy `onOpen` / `onClose` callbacks remain callable (one caller in `code-session-store.ts:155` until Step 5).

**Tests:**
- [x] `connection-lifecycle.test.ts`: initial state, all four state transitions, observer dispatch (registration, unsubscribe, throw-isolation), `connectionDidReconnect` gating across mount path / first reconnect / subsequent reconnects / close-before-first-successful-open / multiple closes between opens / multiple opens after one close / late subscriber receiving later reconnects. **17 cases.**
- [x] `card-session-binding-store.test.ts`: `clearAll()` fires exactly one notify, leaves `getSnapshot().size === 0`, returns a new Map reference, no-op on empty.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [x] `bun test src/__tests__/connection-lifecycle.test.ts src/__tests__/card-session-binding-store.test.ts` green. Full `bun test` suite green.
- [x] `bun run audit:tokens lint` unchanged from `main` baseline (Step 1 has no CSS changes).
- [ ] Manual: in a running tugdeck with HMR, observe the lifecycle traces in the browser console after `pkill -x tugcast` and tugcast respawn. Expect: `[ConnectionLifecycle] connectionDidClose`, `[ConnectionLifecycle] connectionDidEnterReconnecting`, then `connectionWillOpen` → `connectionDidOpen` → `connectionDidReconnect`. Step 1 alone does *not* guarantee submit works — Step 8 closes that loop.

---

#### Step 2 — Client-side heartbeat watchdog {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugdeck: client-side heartbeat watchdog mirrors server timeout`

**References:** [D02], Spec S02, Risk R01, (#watchdog-contract)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/connection.ts` — add `lastFrameAt`, `watchdogTimer`, `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS = 45_000`, `WATCHDOG_TICK_MS = 5_000`. Add `startWatchdog` / `stopWatchdog`. Bump `lastFrameAt` in `onmessage` post-handshake. Stop watchdog in `onclose`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the constants with an explicit comment naming `router.rs:48` as the source of truth for the threshold ([D02]).
- [ ] Initialize `lastFrameAt = Date.now()` after handshake completes (in the same block that calls `startHeartbeat`).
- [ ] Bump `lastFrameAt` on every `onmessage` after the handshake-pending branch returns. Include the binary HEARTBEAT echo path.
- [ ] Start the watchdog timer in `startHeartbeat` (or in a parallel `startWatchdog` called from the same site). Stop in `stopHeartbeat`.
- [ ] In the watchdog tick, if `Date.now() - lastFrameAt > HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS`, call `this.ws?.close()` and log a warn. The existing `onclose` path schedules reconnect.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Connection unit test (with mocked `WebSocket` and fake timers): construct a `TugConnection`, complete the handshake, advance fake time by 50 s without delivering any frame, advance the watchdog tick. Assert `ws.close` was called.
- [ ] Connection unit test: as above, but deliver a frame at t=30 s. Assert no force-close at t=50 s; assert force-close at t=80 s.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test src/connection` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run audit:tokens lint` green.
- [ ] Manual (qualitative; no recipe): observe console — under normal use the watchdog never fires; force a wire stall (e.g., `kill -STOP <tugcast pid>` then `kill -CONT` after 60 s) and confirm a force-close + reconnect within ~5 s of the threshold.

---

#### Step 3 — Clear `lastPayload` on close {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugdeck: clear lastPayload snapshot cache on websocket close`

**References:** [D05], (#internal-architecture)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/connection.ts` — `this.lastPayload.clear()` in the `onclose` handler before `notifyDisconnectState` and before reconnect scheduling.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the `lastPayload.clear()` call in `onclose`. Place it after `stopHeartbeat()` but before `notifyDisconnectState(false)` so any subscriber that re-registers in response to the disconnect state does not see stale frames.
- [ ] Add a one-line comment naming [D05].

**Tests:**
- [ ] Connection unit test: register a callback for a feed, deliver a frame to populate the cache, simulate `onclose`, register a *new* callback for the same feed. Assert the new callback receives no replay.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test src/connection` green.

---

#### Step 4 — Add `transportState` to per-card store {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `tugdeck: add transportState to code-session-store`

**References:** [D01], [D06], Spec S01, (#transport-state-lifecycle)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/types.ts` — add `transportState: "online" | "offline" | "restoring"` to `CodeSessionState` and `CodeSessionSnapshot`. Default `"online"` in `createInitialState`.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/events.ts` — add `transport_open` and `transport_settled` event variants.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/reducer.ts` — rework `handleTransportClose` to set `transportState = "offline"` for every phase (no longer dropped for idle). Set `lastError.cause = "transport_closed"` only for non-idle phases (preserve current error semantics for those). Add `handleTransportOpen` and `handleTransportSettled`. Wire them into the dispatch switch.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store.ts` — `getSnapshot` includes `transportState`. `canSubmit` becomes `(phase === "idle" || phase === "errored") && transportState === "online"`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Extend the type definitions; let TypeScript guide the cascading default-value updates.
- [ ] Update `createInitialState` to include `transportState: "online"`.
- [ ] Rework `handleTransportClose` per [D06]; update existing reducer tests that assert "drops for idle" to the new behavior.
- [ ] Add `handleTransportOpen` (sets `transportState = "restoring"` from any prior state; treat from `online` as a no-op per [D08]).
- [ ] Add `handleTransportSettled` (sets `transportState = "online"`).
- [ ] Update `canSubmit` and the snapshot-equality cache check.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Reducer unit: `transport_close` from each phase → `transportState === "offline"`. Phase preserved for idle (no longer flips to errored); flips to errored for non-idle phases as before.
- [ ] Reducer unit: `transport_open` from `offline` → `restoring`. From `online` → no-op (state reference unchanged).
- [ ] Reducer unit: `transport_settled` from any state → `online`.
- [ ] Snapshot integration: drive a store through `online → offline → restoring → online`; assert `canSubmit` follows.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test src/lib/code-session-store` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run audit:tokens lint` green.

#### Step 5 — Migrate `code-session-store` to lifecycle; remove legacy callable APIs {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugdeck: migrate code-session-store to ConnectionLifecycle; remove legacy onOpen/onClose`

**References:** [D07], [D08], [D09], (#internal-architecture, #connection-lifecycle-contract)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store.ts` — replace the `conn.onClose(...)` subscription at line 155 with two lifecycle observers: `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidClose` (dispatches `transport_close`) and `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidReconnect` (dispatches `transport_open`). Hold both unsubs in `_lifecycleUnsubs: Array<() => void>`. **No `_seenFirstOpen` flag** — [D08]'s gating makes it unnecessary by construction.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/tide-session-restore.ts` — when the `cardSessionBindingStore` subscriber observes a binding for a card, dispatch `transport_settled` into the per-card store (in addition to the existing `tideRestoreRegistry._clear` path). Look up the per-card store via the existing card→store registry.
- `tugdeck/src/connection.ts` — **remove** the legacy `onOpen` / `onClose` callable APIs and their backing `openCallbacks` / `closeCallbacks` arrays. `TugConnection`'s public surface is now `connect`, `close`, `forceReconnect`, `send`, `onFrame`, `setLifecycle`, `sendControlFrame`, `onDisconnectState`. Per [D09].
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/testing/mock-feed-store.ts` — remove `onClose` and `closeCallbacks` from `MockTugConnection`. Tests that previously called `conn.triggerClose()` migrate to `lifecycle.notifyConnectionDidClose()` against a real `ConnectionLifecycle` instance.
- Tests that consume `MockTugConnection.onClose` (`code-session-store.errored.test.ts`, `session-chain.integration.test.ts`, etc.) migrate to constructing a real `ConnectionLifecycle` and driving lifecycle events directly.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add a `lifecycle` parameter (or accessor via `connection.getLifecycle()`) to `CodeSessionStore`'s constructor — whichever fits the existing options shape best.
- [ ] Replace the `conn.onClose` subscription with `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidClose` (still dispatches `transport_close`).
- [ ] Add `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidReconnect` subscription that dispatches `transport_open`. **No flag** — the lifecycle's gating per [D08] guarantees this fires only on real recoveries.
- [ ] Hold both unsubs in `_lifecycleUnsubs`; unsubscribe in the dispose path.
- [ ] In `tide-session-restore.ts` `cardSessionBindingStore` subscriber, after `tideRestoreRegistry._clear(cardId)`, look up the per-card store and dispatch `transport_settled`.
- [ ] Remove `TugConnection.onOpen` and `TugConnection.onClose` (and their backing arrays). Verify there are no remaining callers via `grep`.
- [ ] Remove `MockTugConnection.onClose` and `closeCallbacks`. Verify no tests reference them.
- [ ] Migrate all existing tests that drove `conn.triggerClose()` to drive `lifecycle.notifyConnectionDidClose()` against a real `ConnectionLifecycle` instance constructed in the test.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Store unit: construct a `CodeSessionStore` with a real `ConnectionLifecycle`. Drive `lifecycle.notifyConnectionDidClose()` → assert `transportState === "offline"`. Drive `lifecycle.notifyConnectionDidOpen()` (after a prior open + close to satisfy [D08]) → assert `transportState === "restoring"`. Manually populate `cardSessionBindingStore` for the card → assert `transport_settled` dispatched and `transportState === "online"`.
- [ ] Store unit: construct a store with a connection that's already open (lifecycle in `state="open"`). Verify no spurious `transport_open` dispatch on construction. Drive `notifyConnectionDidClose` then `notifyConnectionDidOpen` → assert `transportState` walks `online → offline → restoring`.
- [ ] Integration: drive the full `connect → open → close → reconnect → open → binding-arrived` cycle through a real `ConnectionLifecycle`; assert `transportState` walks `online → offline → restoring → online`.
- [ ] Migration verification: `grep -rn "TugConnection.onOpen\|conn.onClose\|MockTugConnection.onClose"` returns zero hits in `src/`.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [ ] `bun test src/lib/code-session-store src/lib/tide-session-restore src/__tests__` green (all migrated tests pass).
- [ ] Full `bun test` green (no regressions in unrelated suites).
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint` unchanged from baseline.

#### Step 6 — Surface transport state in UI; gate submit {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-5

**Commit:** `tugdeck: gate tide submit on transportState; render restoring placeholder`

**References:** [D01], [D04], (#transport-state-lifecycle, #public-api)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card-content.tsx` (or `tide-card.tsx`, whichever owns the body switch) — read `transportState` from the per-card snapshot. Render `TideRestoring` (the existing placeholder) when `transportState === "restoring"`, in addition to the existing `tideRestoreRegistry`-driven branch. Gate the submit button: `disabled` while `transportState !== "online"`, with a tooltip / status-row note explaining "Reconnecting to tugcast…" or "Restoring session…".

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Read `transportState` from `useSyncExternalStore` (it already lives in the snapshot per Step 4 — no parallel React state, [L02]).
- [ ] Update the body switch: if `transportState === "restoring"`, render `TideRestoring`. Combine with the existing `tideRestoreRegistry` check using OR (both paths can apply during the brief overlap; rendering `TideRestoring` is idempotent).
- [ ] Update the submit button `disabled` prop and add an `aria-disabled` reason or status-row hint.
- [ ] Confirm no React state is added — all data flows from the snapshot ([L02]).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Component test (happy-dom OK per `feedback_no_happy_dom_tests` — pure component markup): render `TideCardContent` with each of the three `transportState` values via a fake snapshot; assert correct body branch and submit-button state.
- [ ] Snapshot integration: dispatch `transport_close → transport_open` into a store mounted in a real `TideCard`; assert the rendered output transitions through the placeholder and back without React re-render flooding (snapshot reference stable per [L02]).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test src/components/tugways/cards` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run audit:tokens lint` green.
- [ ] Manual (HMR): kill+restart tugcast; confirm the card visibly flips into `TideRestoring` and the submit button disables, then both clear when the binding lands.

---

#### Step 7 — Banner UX tightening {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-6

**Commit:** `tugdeck: tighten banner timing; add reconnected and restoring states`

**References:** Spec S03, (#banner-ux)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/components/chrome/tug-banner-bridge.tsx` — migrate from the existing `connection.onDisconnectState` callback (which is a separate, banner-specific path inside `TugConnection`) to a combination of `lifecycle.observeConnectionDidClose`, `observeConnectionDidEnterReconnecting`, and `observeConnectionDidOpen`. Reduce `SHOW_DELAY_MS` from `2000` to `≤ 250` (or remove the debounce and rely on the lifecycle event timing). Add a "Reconnected ✓" affordance that shows for ≤ 1.5 s on recovery from a *visible* disconnect (track `wasShown: boolean` to gate, fired on `connectionDidReconnect` only when the banner had been visible). Add a "Restoring sessions…" status driven by the union of per-card `transportState === "restoring"` (subscribe via the existing per-card registry — read-only).
- `tests/app-test/at0NNN-tide-banner-fast-show.test.ts` (new) — kill the tugcast subprocess from the harness, observe the banner DOM appears within ≤ 1 s. Recipe ends with `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Migrate banner subscriptions from `connection.onDisconnectState` to lifecycle observers. Keep the `disconnectState` shape (countdown / reason) but compute it from lifecycle events plus the existing internal countdown timer.
- [ ] Lower `SHOW_DELAY_MS` to 250 ms (or zero with a 1-tick guard, whichever the existing test infra accepts cleanly).
- [ ] Add the `wasShown` state machine that flips when the banner becomes visible. The "Reconnected" affordance subscribes to `connectionDidReconnect` and renders only when `wasShown` is true.
- [ ] Add the `restoringCount` subscription; show the status string when `> 0`.
- [ ] Author the app-test recipe per the `feedback_just_app_test` memory: ends with greppable `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL`.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Component test: simulate a `disconnected: true` callback; assert banner is visible at t = 250 ms (was: 2000 ms).
- [ ] Component test: simulate `disconnected: true` then `disconnected: false` while `wasShown === true`; assert "Reconnected" affordance renders, then disappears at t ≤ 1.5 s.
- [ ] Component test: with a fake per-card registry that yields one card in `restoring`, assert "Restoring sessions…" text renders.
- [ ] App-test: `just app-test at0NNN-tide-banner-fast-show.test.ts` exits with `VERDICT: PASS`.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test src/components/chrome` green.
- [ ] `just app-test at0NNN-tide-banner-fast-show.test.ts` final line is `VERDICT: PASS`.

#### Step 8 — Server-side resume reliability ([Q01] resolution) {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-1, #step-2, #step-3, #step-4, #step-5, #step-6, #step-7

**Commit:** depends on the spike outcome — at least one tugcast crate commit; possibly tugcode and/or supporting Rust crates. Each substep gets its own commit.

**References:** [Q01], Risk R04, (#success-criteria)

**Artifacts (concrete subset depends on Step 8a's spike outcome):**
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` — likely the primary surface. Spawn-flow / crash-budget / session-recovery logic lives here.
- Possibly `tugrust/crates/tugcode/src/...` — if tugcode's claude-subprocess management is implicated (orphaned bridge process, stale lock files, JSONL handle).
- Possibly tugcast's `rebind_from_tugbank` if the recovery path needs to mark sessions abandoned more aggressively.
- Possibly a small client-side fallback in `tide-session-restore.ts` if the spike concludes that some sessions are genuinely unrecoverable: in that case, on `SESSION_STATE: errored detail=crash_budget_exhausted` we offer the user a one-click "Start fresh" path that flips the card to `mode=new` while preserving the displayed transcript.

**Tasks:**

*Step 8a — Spike (time-boxed: 1–2 days)*

- [ ] Reproduce locally: launch tugcast, open a tide card, submit a turn so the claude subprocess is alive, `pkill -x tugcast`, observe respawn behavior.
- [ ] Instrument `agent_supervisor.rs` to log every spawn attempt's exit code / signal / stderr / stdout. Capture the actual failure mode for the `crash_budget_exhausted` path.
- [ ] Check for orphaned tugcode bridge processes (`ps aux | grep tugcode` after the kill). If present, that's the issue — `pkill -x tugcast` doesn't transitively kill the subprocesses it spawned.
- [ ] Inspect the per-session JSONL state on disk after the kill. Is it truncated? Is there a lock file? Does claude refuse to resume from it?
- [ ] Document the root cause in the commit message of the resolution commit. Update [Q01]'s resolution field with `DECIDED (see Step 8b)` plus a one-paragraph summary.

*Step 8b — Fix (scope determined by 8a)*

- [ ] Implement the smallest fix that makes `spawn_session(mode=resume)` succeed after `pkill -x tugcast`. Likely candidates by hypothesis:
  - **Orphaned tugcode**: tugcast's startup detects orphaned tugcode bridges and reaps them before `rebind_from_tugbank` runs. (Or tugcast registers a process group so `pkill` cascades.)
  - **JSONL state**: tugcast verifies JSONL integrity before issuing `spawn_session(mode=resume)` to claude; if corrupt, marks the session abandoned and the client's existing `resume_failed` UX flips to a fresh bind.
  - **Crash budget too aggressive**: differentiate "claude subprocess fails to start" (real failure, exhaust budget) from "sub-second-grace-period after parent kill" (don't count toward budget).
  - **Client-side fallback (Risk R04 path)**: if the spike concludes the proper fix is out-of-plan-scope, add a small client-side path: on `SESSION_STATE: errored detail=crash_budget_exhausted`, surface a "Start fresh" button in the existing `Session errored` modal (`tide-card-content.tsx`'s error UI). Click flips the card to `mode=new` while preserving the in-memory transcript display.

*Step 8c — Pin the success criterion*

- [ ] Add a Rust-side test in `tugcast` that simulates the `pkill` scenario and asserts `spawn_session(mode=resume)` succeeds. Use a test-only signal injection that mimics the exit semantics of an actual kill.
- [ ] Update the manual smoke note in Step 1 to remove the "submit doesn't work after kill" caveat.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` against `tugcast` — new spawn-recovery test passes; existing tests stay green.
- [ ] Manual: `pkill -x tugcast`. Wait for respawn. Submit `> hi`. Streaming response arrives.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] [Q01] resolved (root cause documented in a commit message).
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` green for tugcast.
- [ ] Manual smoke for the `pkill -x tugcast` scenario passes end-to-end.
- [ ] If the fallback path was taken (Risk R04), the "Start fresh" UX is documented and a follow-on plan filed for the deeper fix.

---

#### Step 9 — Integration Checkpoint {#step-9}

**Depends on:** #step-1, #step-2, #step-3, #step-4, #step-5, #step-6, #step-7, #step-8

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [D01], [D02], [D04], [D06], [D07], [D08], [D09], [Q01], (#success-criteria)

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/app-test/at0NNN-tide-reconnect-roundtrip.test.ts` (new) — kill+restart tugcast end-to-end; verify card binding flips through `online → offline → restoring → online` without page reload; verify submit works after recovery. Recipe ends with `VERDICT: PASS|FAIL`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Author the end-to-end app-test recipe. Now that Step 8 has fixed the server-side recovery path, "submit works" is a reachable assertion.
- [ ] Walk the [#tuglaws-cross-check] list; record the result in the commit message of Step 8's *previous* commit, or in a `tuglaws-walkthrough` log entry if the project keeps one.
- [ ] Spot-check the [#success-criteria] list against current behavior; flag any criterion that does not hold.

**Tests:**
- [ ] App-test: `just app-test at0NNN-tide-reconnect-roundtrip.test.ts` exits with `VERDICT: PASS`. Asserts: after `pkill -x tugcast`, the card binding re-asserts AND a submitted turn streams a response.
- [ ] Manual scenario (no recipe — laptop sleep is awkward to orchestrate): open a tide card, sleep the laptop for ~2 minutes, wake. The watchdog detects the silent half-open within ~45 s of wake, force-reconnects, the card flips through `restoring → online`, submit works. Note observed timing in the commit message.
- [ ] Manual scenario (no recipe): kill+restart tugcast faster than the old 2 s show-debounce. Banner still shows briefly; cards still flip through `restoring`; submit works again.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bun x tsc --noEmit` green.
- [ ] `bun test` (full suite) green.
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint` green.
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` green.
- [ ] `just app-test at0NNN-tide-reconnect-roundtrip.test.ts` and the banner recipe both end with `VERDICT: PASS`.
- [ ] All [#success-criteria] entries verifiable.

### Tuglaws Cross-Check {#tuglaws-cross-check}

Per the `feedback_tuglaws_cross_check` memory and the constraint in [#constraints], every step that touches the connection layer, the per-card store, or the banner re-checks against [tuglaws.md](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md). The following laws apply:

- **[L02] External state enters React through `useSyncExternalStore` only.** `transportState` is added to the existing `code-session-store` snapshot (Step 4) and read via the existing `useSyncExternalStore` path. No parallel React state. `ConnectionLifecycle` itself is consumed at module scope (Step 1, 5, 7); React reads its effects through the per-card store, never directly.
- **[L03] Use `useLayoutEffect` for registrations that events depend on.** `ConnectionLifecycle` `notify*` calls fire synchronously in the WebSocket transport's call stack; subscribers register at module scope or in `useLayoutEffect` (banner). Per-card store subscriptions in `code-session-store.ts` register at construction (well before any React render).
- **[L11] Controls emit actions; responders own state.** `ConnectionLifecycle` is the action source for connection events; `CodeSessionStore`'s reducer is the responder for `transport_*` events. See [D07] and [D09].
- **[L23] Internal implementation operations must never lose, destroy, or cease to apply user-visible state.** Reconnect must not lose the user-visible transcript. The transcript already accumulated in the store is preserved across `transport_close` / `transport_open` / `transport_settled` cycles. Only `transportState`, the inflight buffers, and gating change. The submit-button gating is purely additive — no in-flight content is discarded. The `lastPayload.clear()` discards only server-authoritative cached frames that are about to be replayed by the post-reconnect handshake. If Step 8b's fallback path (Risk R04) is taken, "Start fresh" preserves the in-memory transcript display while the server-side session is rebound.

The walkthrough is recorded in Step 9's tuglaws-walkthrough verification.

---

### Compatibility / Migration / Rollout {#rollout}

- **Compatibility policy:** Steps 1–7 are tugdeck-internal architecture. Step 5 removes the `TugConnection.onOpen` and `TugConnection.onClose` callable APIs; this is a breaking change to those internal entry points (no external consumers exist). Step 8 *may* touch tugcast (server-side spawn-recovery logic) but does not change the wire shape between tugdeck and tugcast. No tugbank schema changes anywhere in the plan.
- **Migration plan:** None for end-users. Internal callers of `TugConnection.onOpen` / `onClose` are migrated to `ConnectionLifecycle.observe*` in Steps 1 (signalReady) and 5 (code-session-store). `MockTugConnection.onClose` migrates to lifecycle-driven tests in Step 5. `transportState` defaults to `"online"`; existing reducer tests with no transport dispatch stay green.
- **Rollout plan:** Lands on `tugplan-tide-connection-health` branch behind no feature flag. Each step is a green commit; the branch can be merged to `main` once Step 9 passes.
- **Rollback strategy:** Revert the merge commit. No persistent state is introduced; transport state is in-memory only. If Step 8b's tugcast fix needs reverting independently, its commits are separable from the tugdeck-side commits.

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** Tide cards rebind *and submit successfully* after a `pkill -x tugcast`, without a page reload. The client detects half-open WebSocket states within ~45 s. All connection events flow through `ConnectionLifecycle`.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] All nine execution steps committed; each commit's checkpoint passes.
- [ ] `bun x tsc --noEmit` green on `main` after merge.
- [ ] `bun test` green on `main` after merge.
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint` green on `main` after merge.
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` green on `main` after merge.
- [ ] `just app-test at0NNN-tide-reconnect-roundtrip.test.ts` (asserting submit-works end-to-end) and the banner-fast-show recipe both `VERDICT: PASS`.
- [ ] `grep -rn "TugConnection.onOpen\|conn.onOpen\|conn.onClose\|MockTugConnection.onClose"` in `src/` returns zero hits — [D09] is enforced.
- [ ] [#success-criteria] all hold under manual smoke.

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] App-test: `at0NNN-tide-reconnect-roundtrip.test.ts` `VERDICT: PASS` (binding re-asserts AND submit works after kill+restart).
- [ ] App-test: `at0NNN-tide-banner-fast-show.test.ts` `VERDICT: PASS`.
- [ ] Lifecycle unit tests under `tugdeck/src/__tests__/connection-lifecycle.test.ts` covering all gating corner cases.
- [ ] Reducer + store unit tests under `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/__tests__/` covering all transport-event transitions.
- [ ] Tugcast spawn-recovery test under `tugrust/crates/tugcast/...` exercising the simulated `pkill` scenario.

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] Server-pushed `client_recognized { sessions: [...] }` frame for defense-in-depth (deferred per [D03]).
- [ ] Telemetry on watchdog firings vs `connectionDidClose` arrivals — useful for tuning the threshold if real-world data suggests drift.
- [ ] Apply the same transport-state pattern to `card-services-store` if that store grows wire-dependent state.
- [ ] If Step 8b took the Risk R04 fallback path: a follow-on plan against tugcast / tugcode for the deeper spawn-recovery fix that preserves transcript continuity rather than offering "Start fresh."
- [ ] A `useConnectionLifecycle` React hook for components that need to subscribe to connection events directly (none in this plan; deferred until a real consumer appears).

| Checkpoint | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| Step 0 plan landed and Step 7.5 redirect | `grep -n "step-7-5" roadmap/tugplan-tide-card-polish.md` shows the redirect |
| Step 1 ConnectionLifecycle + reconnect handler | `connection-lifecycle.test.ts` green; manual: console traces show full will/did/reconnect cycle |
| Step 2 watchdog fires on stale wire | Connection unit test green |
| Step 3 `lastPayload` cleared on close | Connection unit test green |
| Step 4 `transportState` field present | Reducer unit tests green |
| Step 5 store migrated to lifecycle; legacy APIs removed | `grep` returns zero hits for `TugConnection.onOpen`/`onClose` and `MockTugConnection.onClose` |
| Step 6 UI gates on `transportState` | Component test green; manual: card disables submit during reconnect |
| Step 7 banner UX | Component tests green; `just app-test` banner recipe `VERDICT: PASS` |
| Step 8 server-side resume reliability | [Q01] resolved; `cargo nextest run` green for tugcast; manual: `pkill -x tugcast` → submit works |
| Step 9 integration | `just app-test` reconnect recipe `VERDICT: PASS` (asserts submit-works); manual sleep/wake check noted |
