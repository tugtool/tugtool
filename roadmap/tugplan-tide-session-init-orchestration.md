## Tide Session-Init Orchestration {#tide-session-init-orchestration}

**Purpose:** Make the click-to-caret experience on the Tide card feel finely crafted: suppress the misplaced "Loading session…" banner that flashes when the user opens a new session, document and stress-test the focus/caret contract that governs how the prompt-entry editor takes first responder, and coordinate the picker→body transition with a brief body fade-in so the moving parts feel choreographed rather than abrupt.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

The Tide card today renders a `TugSheet`-hosted picker while unbound, then flips to a `TugSplitPane` body the moment `spawn_session_ok` lands and `cardSessionBindingStore` populates. The sequence works — the chain converges, the editor focuses, the caret blinks — but the user-visible orchestration is uncoordinated:

- For a **new** session, a "Loading session…" banner mounts for ~700ms (`minMountedMs=500` floor + 200ms exit) even though there is no JSONL to replay. The banner is firing because `sendRequestReplay` is dispatched unconditionally on every binding land (`card-services-store.ts:312`), the wire returns `replay_started → replay_complete{kind: "jsonl_missing"}`, and `deriveTideCardBannerSpec` branch 5 (`phase === "replaying"`) lights up the banner indiscriminately.
- During that window the editor's caret flashes and is stolen: `cardDidActivate` fires focus on subscribe, then the banner mounts and sets `inert` on `.tug-pane-body` (browser strips focus from the contentDOM, caret-layer stops painting), then `bannerDidHide` fires and the focus claim re-runs. The user sees a flicker.
- The picker→body transition is a hard appearance: the body has no enter animation, while the sheet is still translating out. The two animations don't share a beat.

The good news is that the focus-claim plumbing (`560beb5b` — "tide(focus): SheetLifecycle + BannerLifecycle for prompt-entry focus") is correct and load-bearing. The fragility the previous bug revealed — that the caret depends on `inert` clearing followed by an explicit re-focus — is solved by composing per-overlay lifecycle events. The architecture is sound; what's misaligned is the *content* the banner is showing for new sessions and the *visual handoff* between picker and body.

This plan addresses three independent improvements to the click-to-caret experience, ordered by user-visible value:

1. **Banner suppression for new sessions.** The "Loading session…" banner has no referent during new-session init; suppress it by data, not timing.
2. **Focus-contract documentation.** The lifecycle-based focus model is correct but its load-bearing invariant is not written down where the next reader will see it; document it in code.
3. **Body fade-in.** Add a brief opacity ramp on the body's first mount so the picker→body handoff reads as choreographed.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **Verify before changing.** Two pre-existing constraints govern this work and were verified before authoring (see [V01](#v01-sheet-exit-deferral) and [V02](#v02-preflight-phase-atomicity)). Surfaces that look reducible (the 220ms `SHEET_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS` deferral) are load-bearing and stay.
- **Suppress by data, not by timing.** The banner-spec helper is pure. Gating the silly banner is a one-line guard in the helper, predicated on a field threaded onto the snapshot — no race, no timer, no observability gap.
- **Preserve the existing focus-claim model.** The lifecycle-event focus claim composes per-overlay, is idempotent, and is pinned by `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts`. Do not "robustify" it by introducing a single derived signal or by reading `inert` through a `MutationObserver`; both alternatives blur structure-zone boundaries ([L24](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l24)) and weaken commit-ordering guarantees.
- **Document the contract where it lives.** Every overlay that sets `inert` on `.tug-pane-body` for a card MUST emit a per-card `didHide` lifecycle event, and the card MUST subscribe with an idempotent focus claim. Today this is true; tomorrow's overlay author needs to read it before they discover it the hard way.
- **Animate the body via TugAnimator, not CSS.** Mount/unmount is React-driven (binding flip), so [L13](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l13) / [L14](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l14) put this in TugAnimator's lane.
- **One commit per step.** Build stays green at every commit; `bun run check`, `bun test`, `cargo nextest run`, `bun run audit:tokens lint` pass on every step. `-D warnings` enforced.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

**New-session banner suppression:**
- For a new-mode binding, `<TugPaneBanner>` is **never mounted** during the bind→replay round-trip. (verification: `at0051` augmented with a "no banner mount on new-mode bind" assertion + manual)
- Click-to-caret latency for a new session is bounded by sheet-exit + binding-land + cardDidActivate, with no banner gate. Target ≤ 300ms wall time from `sendSpawnSession` to caret-blink. (verification: at0051 timepoint capture)
- For a resume-mode binding, the banner mounts as today and exits when replay completes; `bannerDidHide` re-claims focus exactly once. (verification: at0051 unchanged for resume path)

**Focus-contract documentation:**
- `tide-card.tsx`'s focus-claim block (currently around lines 1656–1697) carries an explicit comment naming the L24 invariant ("every overlay that sets inert MUST emit a didHide; this card MUST subscribe with an idempotent focus claim"), citing the at0051 test as the contract. (verification: code review)
- `tug-pane-banner.tsx` and `tug-sheet.tsx` carry call-site comments at their `notifyXxxDidHide` emissions stating the event is load-bearing for editor-focus restoration. (verification: code review)

**Body fade-in:**
- On the first mount of `TideCardBody` for a card, `.tide-card` ramps opacity 0→1 over `--tug-motion-duration-moderate` (200ms), `ease-out`, exactly once. The animation does not re-run on later prop or store updates. (verification: gallery harness or augmented at0051 + manual)
- The fade-in does not interfere with focus-claim: caret-layer is paintable from the moment the body mounts (focus claim is independent of body opacity). (verification: at0051 + manual)
- For resume sessions where the banner is also entering, the two animations coexist (banner strip slides over a fading-in body) without visual stutter. (verification: manual)

**Compliance:**
- All new/changed components pass the component authoring guide checklist.
- `bun run audit:tokens lint` exits 0.
- Vitest + Rust nextest suites pass with `-D warnings`.
- No new IndexedDB / localStorage dependencies (per [tide.md D-T3-10](./tide.md#decisions-t3) and the user's no-localStorage rule).

#### Scope {#scope}

**In scope:**
1. Threading `sessionMode` from the binding onto `CodeSessionSnapshot`.
2. Gating `deriveTideCardBannerSpec` branch 5 on resume mode.
3. In-code documentation of the focus contract at three call sites (`tide-card.tsx`, `tug-pane-banner.tsx`, `tug-sheet.tsx`).
4. Body opacity fade-in on `TideCardBody` first mount.
5. `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts` augmentation: assert no banner mount for new-mode binding; assert click-to-caret budget; preserve existing resume-path assertions.

**Out of scope:** see [non-goals](#non-goals).

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- **Reducing `SHEET_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS`.** Verification [V01](#v01-sheet-exit-deferral) shows the 220ms deferral is load-bearing — the picker's React subtree owns the sheet's lifecycle, and reducing the deferral re-introduces the "sheet just disappears on Open" bug. Out of scope.
- **Lifting `<TugSheet>`'s React parent above the picker.** Would let us overlap sheet-exit with body-mount honestly, but it's a structural restructuring with its own ripple. Tracked as a follow-on; not in this plan.
- **Replacing the resume banner with a `TideRestoring`-style backdrop.** A different UX for resume worth considering, but a redesign rather than a polish pass. Not in this plan.
- **Centralizing focus claim via a single derived "interactive" signal or a `MutationObserver` on `inert`.** See [D02](#d02-keep-lifecycle-focus-model) for the rationale. Not in this plan.
- **Reducing the banner's `minMountedMs` for the resume path.** The 500ms floor is correctly placed for the case where the banner has real content (resume preflight); leave it.
- **Animating the split-pane sash on first paint.** Body fade-in carries the entrance work.

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- The `560beb5b` SheetLifecycle + BannerLifecycle wiring is already landed and is a hard prerequisite. This plan extends and documents that work; it does not re-do it.
- `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts` exists and runs in the app-test harness with `TUGAPP_APP_TEST=1`. Augmenting it requires the harness's existing `seedDeckState` + `bindTideSession` helpers.
- `cardSessionBindingStore.CardSessionMode` (the `"new" | "resume"` discriminator) already exists and is set by the picker's Open / Retry callbacks via `sendSpawnSession`.

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- **`SHEET_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS = 220` is fixed by [V01](#v01-sheet-exit-deferral).** Any sequencing in this plan must compose with that constraint, not assume it can be reduced.
- **The focus delegate routes through `manager.focusResponder(responderId)`** (`tug-text-editor.tsx`, post-560beb5b). All focus claims must use this path; raw `view.focus()` calls are reserved for the chain-less harness fallback.
- **Banner mount/unmount lifecycle is the source of truth for `inert`** (`tug-pane-banner.tsx:362–375`). Anything that wants to know "is the body inert because of a banner?" must observe the banner-lifecycle event pipe, not read the attribute.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The `JSONL-missing` reply for new sessions returns within 100ms in-process. (Confirmed today by the comment at `card-services-store.ts:283` describing the round-trip as "harmless flash through `replaying` back to `idle`.")
- Adding `sessionMode` to `CodeSessionSnapshot` does not break existing snapshot consumers (it's additive and never changes after construction).
- `TugAnimator`'s WAAPI animations cooperate with parent React unmount cleanly — interrupted animations are tracked already in tug-pane-banner / tug-sheet patterns.

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] sessionMode plumbing path — store snapshot vs. external context (OPEN) {#q01-sessionmode-plumbing}

**Question:** Should `sessionMode` enter the banner-spec helper through (a) `CodeSessionSnapshot` (threaded into the store at construction time), or (b) a separate read of `cardSessionBindingStore` from the helper's call site?

**Why it matters:** Option (a) keeps the helper pure (one input shape, one output shape) and lets the store's existing `useSyncExternalStore` plumbing carry the value through with no second subscription. Option (b) avoids touching the store schema but introduces a second store read at the call site, and the helper becomes parameterized on something not in the snapshot — slightly worsening testability.

**Options:**
- **(a)** Add `sessionMode: CardSessionMode` to `CodeSessionSnapshot`. Store reads it from the binding at construction.
- **(b)** Read `sessionMode` from `cardSessionBindingStore` in `TideCardBody` and pass as a second arg to `deriveTideCardBannerSpec`.

**Plan to resolve:** Decide at plan-author time. Recommendation: option (a) — see [D01](#d01-sessionmode-on-snapshot).

**Resolution:** DECIDED — see [D01](#d01-sessionmode-on-snapshot).

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Banner-suppression breaks the resume focus contract | high | low | at0051 still asserts banner mount + bannerDidHide focus reclaim for resume; new-mode test only covers new path | at0051 fails on resume path |
| Body fade-in interferes with caret paint | med | low | fade is opacity-only; caret-layer paints regardless of opacity (it reads `view.hasFocus`, not visibility); manual smoke + at0051 caret-count assertion guards this | manual sees caret flicker during fade |
| Future overlay author skips `notifyXxxDidHide` and breaks caret silently | med | med | doc comments at all three call sites + the at0051 test as the canonical contract pin | new overlay merged without lifecycle wiring |

**Risk R01: Resume-path focus regression** {#r01-resume-focus-regression}

- **Risk:** The banner-suppression change (gating branch 5 on `sessionMode === "resume"`) inadvertently affects the resume path — for example, by mis-typing the predicate or by accidentally also suppressing branch 1 (preflight).
- **Mitigation:**
  - Branch 1 is already implicitly gated to resume mode upstream (`notifyResumeBindingLanded()` is called only for resume mode in `card-services-store.ts:309`); the change does not touch branch 1.
  - The change to branch 5 is a single conditional return; the helper's existing unit tests cover both kinds, plus new cases for new-mode in `tide-card-banner-spec.test.ts`.
  - `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts` keeps the resume-path assertion that the banner mounts and `bannerDidHide` re-claims focus.
- **Residual risk:** none material — the change is local to one branch and the resume path is separately tested.

**Risk R02: A future overlay that sets `inert` without emitting `didHide`** {#r02-future-overlay-no-didhide}

- **Risk:** A new modal-class component (a future `TugCallout`, a redesigned drag-drop affordance, etc.) sets `inert` on `.tug-pane-body` to manage its own focus scope but doesn't emit a per-card `didHide`. The card's focus-claim handlers don't fire on its dismissal, the editor stays unfocused, and the caret stops painting. The user discovers it in two hours of debugging, like before.
- **Mitigation:**
  - In-code contract documentation in `tide-card.tsx` (call-site near the focus-claim handlers) names the rule: "every overlay that sets inert on .tug-pane-body MUST emit a per-card didHide lifecycle event."
  - Companion comments at `tug-pane-banner.tsx` and `tug-sheet.tsx` `notifyXxxDidHide` call sites flag the events as load-bearing.
  - The at0051 test pins the existing contract, so any silent removal of an emission breaks the test.
- **Residual risk:** the rule is enforceable only by code review for new overlays; there is no static check. Documenting it is the strongest tool we have without introducing a new linter.

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [D01] sessionMode threaded onto CodeSessionSnapshot, not read separately at the call site (DECIDED) {#d01-sessionmode-on-snapshot}

**Decision:** Add `sessionMode: CardSessionMode` (the `"new" | "resume"` discriminator) to `CodeSessionSnapshot`. The store captures it at construction time from the binding `cardServicesStore` already reads.

**Rationale:**
- Keeps `deriveTideCardBannerSpec` pure: one snapshot in, one spec out. No second-argument widening, no second-store lookup.
- Reuses the existing `useSyncExternalStore` subscription path. Adding a new store dep at the call site would mean a second `useSyncExternalStore` for a value that never changes after construction — wasteful.
- `sessionMode` is structure-zone metadata that parameterizes the store's behavior (and now its derivation surface). It belongs on the snapshot the same way `tugSessionId` does.
- Tests already construct stores with explicit options; adding a constructor arg is a one-line touch in fixtures.

**Implications:**
- `CodeSessionStore` constructor signature gains a `sessionMode` field; `cardServicesStore._construct` passes `binding.sessionMode`.
- `CodeSessionSnapshot` type gains a `readonly sessionMode: CardSessionMode` field.
- Snapshot consumers that build their own snapshots in tests need to add `sessionMode: "new"` (or "resume") to fixtures. The reducer's initial-state helper handles production paths centrally.

#### [D02] Keep the lifecycle-event focus model; do not centralize via MutationObserver or a derived "interactive" signal (DECIDED) {#d02-keep-lifecycle-focus-model}

**Decision:** Continue claiming editor focus via per-overlay `useXxxDelegate({ xxxDidHide })` subscriptions in `TideCardBody` (sheet, banner, future overlays). Do not introduce a `MutationObserver` on `.tug-pane-body`'s `inert` attribute, and do not introduce a `useSyncExternalStore`-derived "interactive" signal in `TideCardBody`.

**Rationale:**
- The lifecycle events fire from inside the same React commit that clears `inert` (see `tug-pane-banner.tsx:304-314`). The focus claim happens in the structurally correct moment — no race window.
- A derived "interactive" signal would lag by a render cycle (the snapshot must propagate before the consumer recomputes), opening a race where the contentDOM is focusable but the consumer doesn't yet know it.
- A `MutationObserver` on `inert` would centralize the read but also blur the [L24](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l24) zone boundary: `inert` is a structure-zone DOM attribute set by structure-zone code, but the MO would treat it as appearance-zone telemetry the way a CSS `data-state` is read. The lifecycle pipe is the correct structure-zone abstraction.
- The composability cost ("every new overlay must wire its own didHide") is small and exactly the kind of contract that lives well in code comments + a contract test.

**Implications:**
- The current focus-claim handlers stay. Documentation is added to make their invariant explicit.
- New overlay components must wire a per-card `didXxxHide` lifecycle event and follow the same pattern.

#### [D03] Body fade-in via TugAnimator, not CSS keyframes (DECIDED) {#d03-body-fade-via-tuganimator}

**Decision:** The `TideCardBody` first-mount opacity ramp is driven by `TugAnimator` (`group({ duration: "--tug-motion-duration-moderate" })`) inside a `useLayoutEffect` keyed on the root `.tide-card` element captured at mount.

**Rationale:**
- Body mount is React-driven (binding flip causes mount); per [L14](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l14), Radix Presence isn't owning enter/exit here, and per [L13](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l13), TugAnimator is the right tool for programmatic motion that needs to coordinate with React mount.
- TugAnimator's `g.finished` provides cancellation semantics if the body unmounts mid-fade (e.g., user closes the card quickly).
- A CSS keyframe + `data-state` approach would require a parallel "first-mount-only" state attribute, which is needless complexity for a one-shot animation.

**Implications:**
- A small `useLayoutEffect` in `TideCardBody` runs once on mount and animates the root element. The effect's dep array is `[]`; subsequent re-renders do not re-trigger.
- No new CSS tokens. The duration token already exists.

#### [D04] `SHEET_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS` stays at 220 (DECIDED) {#d04-sheet-exit-deferral-stays}

**Decision:** Do not reduce or remove the 220ms `SHEET_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS` deferral in `TideProjectPicker.onOpen` / `onRetry`.

**Rationale:** Verification [V01](#v01-sheet-exit-deferral) showed the deferral is load-bearing. `useTugSheet` renders `<TugSheet>` from inside the picker's render tree; when the binding lands and `TideCardContent` flips picker → body, the picker subtree (and the sheet's React parent) unmounts mid-animation. The portaled DOM goes with it. The deferral exists to let the sheet finish its exit before the binding-flip cascade unmounts it.

**Implications:**
- The new-session click-to-caret latency floor includes the 220ms sheet exit; we cannot drive it lower without restructuring the picker→sheet relationship.
- A future plan may lift the sheet's React parent above the picker (e.g., to `TideCardContent` or a card-level `<TugSheetHost>`). That work is explicitly out of scope here.

---

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### [V01] Sheet exit deferral is load-bearing {#v01-sheet-exit-deferral}

`useTugSheet` exposes `renderSheet()`, which returns a `<TugSheet>` element rendered from inside the picker's JSX (`tide-card.tsx:682`, `<div className="tide-card-picker-backdrop">{renderSheet()}</div>`). The portaled DOM target is the host pane's chrome (`tug-sheet.tsx:367`, via `TugPanePortalContext`), so the *DOM target* is independent of the picker — but the *React parent* of `<TugSheetContent>` is `TideProjectPicker`. When `cardSessionBindingStore` populates and `TideCardContent` re-renders to `TideCardServicesGate`, `TideProjectPicker` unmounts. React unmounts `<TugSheetContent>`, which removes the portaled DOM, even if the exit animation is still running.

This is exactly why `SHEET_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS = 220` exists. From `tide-card.tsx:586–602`:

> `spawn_session_ok` arrives in single-digit milliseconds in-process, and the resulting binding update flips this card from picker → body, unmounting the picker (and its sheet host) mid-animation. The user-visible symptom is the sheet "just disappearing" on Open while Cancel animates correctly.

The deferral keeps `sendSpawnSession` from firing until after the sheet has had time to play its exit. Reducing it would re-introduce the "sheet just disappears" bug. The structurally correct fix is to lift the sheet's React parent above the picker (so it survives the inner flip), but that's out of scope here.

#### [V02] Resume preflight → replay phase is atomic {#v02-preflight-phase-atomicity}

The reducer's `handleReplayStarted` (`tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/reducer.ts:1340–1380`) returns a single state object with both `replayPreflightActive: false` AND `phase: "replaying"`. Snapshot subscribers see one notify cycle for the transition `{preflight: true, phase: idle}` → `{preflight: false, phase: replaying}`. `deriveTideCardBannerSpec` returns `{ kind: "replay-loading" }` for both halves — continuous banner across the handoff.

Edge cases where preflight clears *without* phase opening:
- 12s `tick_preflight_done`: banner spec → `"none"`. This is the "give up waiting" beat; focus claim is correct here.
- Transport disruption: `transportState` is no longer `"online"`, so `TideCardServicesGate` routes to `TideRestoring`. Body's banner doesn't render.

Therefore: a focus derivation gated on `bannerSpec.kind === "none" AND transportState === "online"` would *not* prematurely fire focus during the resume happy path. We do not adopt such a derivation in this plan ([D02](#d02-keep-lifecycle-focus-model)), but the verification rules out a class of alternative designs that would otherwise have looked viable.

#### [V03] Why `bannerDidHide` is load-bearing for the caret {#v03-bannerdidhide-load-bearing}

From `560beb5b`'s commit message and `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts`'s docstring: the earlier symptom guarded against was **caret flashes and is stolen as a banner mounts** (banner sets `inert` on `.tug-pane-body` → browser strips focus from `.cm-content` → CodeMirror's caret-layer stops painting), then the banner hides without anyone re-focusing the editor.

The mechanism is concrete:

1. `cardDidActivate` fires when the card becomes first responder → `entryDelegate.focus()` → `manager.focusResponder(responderId)` → atomic chain promotion + DOM focus on `.cm-content`. Caret-layer renders (it paints only when `view.hasFocus`).
2. Banner mounts → `inert` set on `.tug-pane-body` (`tug-pane-banner.tsx:367`) → browser strips focus → `view.hasFocus` becomes false → caret-layer stops rendering.
3. Banner exits → `inert` cleared (`tug-pane-banner.tsx:370`, in the same React commit as `setMounted(false)`) → without a re-focus, the caret stays gone.

The fix wires `bannerDidHide` (which fires inside the same commit that clears `inert`) to call `entryDelegate.focus()` again. **That's load-bearing.** The focus delegate itself is robust (idempotent, chain-aware); the brittleness is purely about *when* — focus must be claimed AFTER any inert-setting overlay has cleared.

This plan suppresses the new-session banner so the cycle simply doesn't run for new mode (no banner to mount, no inert to set, no focus to lose, no reclaim needed). For resume mode, the cycle remains intact and `bannerDidHide` continues to be the focus reclaim path.

---

### Specification {#specification}

#### Spec S01: Banner-spec semantics by sessionMode {#s01-banner-spec-by-mode}

The pure helper `deriveTideCardBannerSpec(snap, ctx)` — `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card-banner-spec.ts` — gates branch 5 (the `phase === "replaying"` branch) on `snap.sessionMode === "resume"`:

- **`sessionMode === "new"`:** branch 5 returns `{ kind: "none" }` regardless of `phase`. Branches 1–4 (preflight / error / transport / replay-timeout) are unchanged; in practice branch 1 already never fires for new mode (preflight is gated upstream), and branches 2–4 are unaffected.
- **`sessionMode === "resume"`:** branch 5 behaves as today.

The helper's precedence chain otherwise stays the same. The module docstring is updated to record this rule.

#### Spec S02: Editor focus contract (the inert/didHide rule) {#s02-editor-focus-contract}

**Invariant:** every overlay that sets `inert` on `.tug-pane-body` for a Tide card MUST emit a per-card `xxxDidHide` lifecycle event after `inert` is cleared, and `TideCardBody` MUST subscribe with an idempotent focus claim (`entryDelegateRef.current?.focus()`) gated on this card being first responder.

**Why:**
- The browser strips focus from any element inside an `inert` subtree. CodeMirror's caret-layer paints only while `view.hasFocus` is true.
- Without a re-focus after `inert` clears, the editor stays unfocused and the caret does not return.
- Lifecycle events fire from inside the structure-zone commit that clears `inert` ([L24](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l24)); this is the structurally correct moment to re-claim focus.

**Today's overlays satisfying the contract:**
- `TugSheet` — emits `sheetDidHide` from `tug-sheet.tsx:498`.
- `TugPaneBanner` — emits `bannerDidHide` from `tug-pane-banner.tsx:311`.

**`TideCardBody`'s subscriptions** (`tide-card.tsx`, around lines 1656–1697):
- `useSheetDelegate(cardId, { sheetDidHide })` → focus claim.
- `useBannerDelegate(cardId, { bannerDidHide })` → focus claim.
- Both gated on `cardLifecycle?.getFirstResponderCardId() === cardId`.
- Both calls are idempotent — calling `manager.focusResponder(editorId)` against an already-focused editor is a no-op for state and DOM.

**Pinned by:** `tests/app-test/at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts`. New overlays that violate the contract break this test.

#### Spec S03: Body first-mount fade-in {#s03-body-fade-in}

`TideCardBody`'s root element (`<div className="tide-card">`, `tide-card.tsx:1851`) animates `opacity: 0 → 1` over `--tug-motion-duration-moderate` (200ms), `ease-out`, exactly once on first mount.

**Mechanics:**
- `useLayoutEffect` with empty deps captures the root via ref and runs `g.animate(rootEl, [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }], { key: "tide-card-enter", easing: "ease-out" })` from `TugAnimator`'s `group({ duration: "--tug-motion-duration-moderate" })`.
- No `useState`-mirrored "isMounted" boolean; the WAAPI animation owns the opacity over its duration. After completion, the element's inline opacity returns to its CSS-default (1) via WAAPI's commit-style "fill: none" default.
- Cancellation: if the body unmounts mid-fade, `g.finished` rejects; nothing else needs to happen because the DOM is going away.

**Properties preserved:**
- The fade does not set `inert`, does not interfere with `cardDidActivate`'s focus claim.
- The fade does not touch React state and does not re-render the body.
- The fade is opacity-only; layout, focus, selection, scroll position are untouched ([L23](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l23)).

- [ ] Add a docblock above the focus-claim handlers in `tide-card.tsx` naming the [L24](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l24) invariant + citing `at0051`.
- [ ] Add inline comments at `notifyBannerDidHide` (tug-pane-banner.tsx) and `notifySheetDidHide` (tug-sheet.tsx) call sites.
- [ ] Update `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts` docstring to describe the new-mode no-banner contract.

No external (markdown) docs are added; the contracts live where the code lives.

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Unit (banner spec)** | Verify `deriveTideCardBannerSpec` returns `none` for new-mode replaying-phase snapshots, and unchanged spec for resume-mode | every change to the helper |
| **Integration (at0051)** | Verify caret blinks within budget for new mode without a banner mount; resume path unchanged | every change to focus or banner choreography |
| **Manual smoke** | Visually confirm picker→body fade-in feels coordinated; resume banner overlaps body fade cleanly | once per landed change |

Specific test additions:
- `tide-card-banner-spec.test.ts` — new cases: `phase: "replaying"` + `sessionMode: "new"` → `kind: "none"`; same with `"resume"` → `kind: "replay-loading"`; preflight + new mode (defensive) → `kind: "replay-loading"` (preflight already implicitly resume-only, but the helper does not need to know that, so this case asserts the helper itself doesn't gate branch 1).
- `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts` — augmentation: assert that when binding is seeded as new mode, no `[data-slot="tug-pane-banner"]` element is ever observed in the DOM during the bind window; assert click-to-caret budget; preserve resume-path assertions.

### Execution Steps {#execution-steps}

> **References are mandatory:** every step cites specific plan artifacts and tuglaw anchors.

#### Step 1: Thread sessionMode onto CodeSessionSnapshot {#step-1}

**Commit:** `code-session-store: thread sessionMode onto snapshot`

**References:** [D01](#d01-sessionmode-on-snapshot), [Q01](#q01-sessionmode-plumbing), [L02](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l02), [L24](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l24), Spec [S01](#s01-banner-spec-by-mode)

**Artifacts:**
- `CodeSessionStore` constructor takes `sessionMode: CardSessionMode`.
- `CodeSessionSnapshot` gains `readonly sessionMode: CardSessionMode`.
- `cardServicesStore._construct` passes `binding.sessionMode` to the store.
- Reducer initial-state helper accepts `sessionMode`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the field to the snapshot type and the store class.
- [ ] Update the reducer's initial-state factory to thread `sessionMode` from the constructor.
- [ ] Update `cardServicesStore._construct` to pass `binding.sessionMode`.
- [ ] Update test fixtures (any place that constructs a `CodeSessionStore` or builds a snapshot directly) to add `sessionMode`. Default fixtures to `"new"` unless a test specifically exercises resume.
- [ ] Verify no consumer reads `sessionMode` yet (it's purely additive in this step).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Existing `code-session-store.*.test.ts` suites compile and pass with the new field.
- [ ] Add a smoke test asserting `store.getSnapshot().sessionMode === "new"` and `=== "resume"` for the two construction modes.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run check`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test`
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run`

#### Step 2: Gate banner branch 5 on sessionMode === "resume" {#step-2}

**Depends on:** [#step-1](#step-1)

**Commit:** `tide(banner-spec): suppress replaying-phase banner for new sessions`

**References:** Spec [S01](#s01-banner-spec-by-mode), [V03](#v03-bannerdidhide-load-bearing), [R01](#r01-resume-focus-regression), [L11](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l11), [L23](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l23)

**Artifacts:**
- `deriveTideCardBannerSpec` branch 5 returns `none` for new mode.
- Module docstring updated to document the rule.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Single-line guard in `tide-card-banner-spec.ts`: `if (snap.phase === "replaying" && snap.sessionMode === "new") return { kind: "none" }` — placed between branch 4 (replay-timeout) and branch 5's existing logic, OR fold into branch 5's guard. Match existing style of the helper.
- [ ] Update the module-top docstring's "Precedence" section to record the rule.
- [ ] Verify branches 1–4 are unchanged (no edit to error / transport / preflight / replay-timeout).

**Tests:**
- [ ] `tide-card-banner-spec.test.ts` — add cases:
  - `phase: "replaying"` + `sessionMode: "new"` + everything-else-clear → `{ kind: "none" }`.
  - `phase: "replaying"` + `sessionMode: "resume"` + everything-else-clear → `{ kind: "replay-loading", turnsCount: <expected> }` (unchanged from today).
  - Defensive: `replayPreflightActive: true` + `sessionMode: "new"` → still returns `{ kind: "replay-loading", turnsCount: null }` (helper itself doesn't gate branch 1 on mode; production never emits this combination, but the unit test pins the helper's surface).
- [ ] Existing helper tests pass unmodified.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run check`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test src/components/tugways/cards/__tests__/tide-card-banner-spec.test.ts`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test`

#### Step 3: Document the focus contract in code {#step-3}

**Depends on:** [#step-2](#step-2)

**Commit:** `tide(focus): document inert/didHide contract at call sites`

**References:** Spec [S02](#s02-editor-focus-contract), [V03](#v03-bannerdidhide-load-bearing), [R02](#r02-future-overlay-no-didhide), [D02](#d02-keep-lifecycle-focus-model), [L24](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l24)

**Artifacts:**
- Docblock above `useSheetDelegate` / `useBannerDelegate` calls in `tide-card.tsx` (around current lines 1656–1697) naming the L24 invariant.
- Inline comment at `notifyBannerDidHide` call site in `tug-pane-banner.tsx` flagging the event as load-bearing for editor focus restoration; cites `at0051`.
- Inline comment at `notifySheetDidHide` call site in `tug-sheet.tsx` with the same flag.
- Module docstring update on `tide-card-banner-spec.ts` (folded in if natural alongside Step 2; otherwise here).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write the docblock for `tide-card.tsx`. Include the rule: "every overlay that sets `inert` on `.tug-pane-body` for this card MUST emit a per-card `xxxDidHide` lifecycle event; this card's focus-claim handlers subscribe to that event and re-claim editor focus, gated on this card being first responder. The claim is idempotent." Reference [L24] and `tests/app-test/at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts`.
- [ ] Write the inline comments in `tug-pane-banner.tsx` and `tug-sheet.tsx`. Keep them short (one short paragraph each), following the project's commenting voice.
- [ ] No code logic changes in this step.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Existing tests pass; this step is documentation-only.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run check`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test` (sanity)

#### Step 4: Body first-mount fade-in via TugAnimator {#step-4}

**Depends on:** [#step-2](#step-2)

**Commit:** `tide(card): fade body in on first mount`

**References:** Spec [S03](#s03-body-fade-in), [D03](#d03-body-fade-via-tuganimator), [L13](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l13), [L14](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l14), [L23](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l23), [L24](../tuglaws/tuglaws.md#l24)

**Artifacts:**
- `useLayoutEffect` in `TideCardBody` that animates `.tide-card` opacity 0→1 once on mount.
- No new CSS tokens; existing `--tug-motion-duration-moderate` is reused.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Capture `.tide-card` via a ref (`tideCardRootRef`).
- [ ] Add a `useLayoutEffect` with empty deps that runs `group({ duration: "--tug-motion-duration-moderate" }).animate(el, [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }], { key: "tide-card-enter", easing: "ease-out" })`.
- [ ] Verify the WAAPI animation does not interfere with `cardDidActivate`'s focus claim — focus runs synchronously on the lifecycle event, which fires from `useCardDelegate`'s `useLayoutEffect`; the fade is a separate effect.
- [ ] Verify the fade does not interfere with banner enter for resume sessions: the banner is portaled into the pane chrome, sits on top of the body in stacking, and animates independently. Manual smoke for resume.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Manual: open a new session, observe body fade-in.
- [ ] Manual: open a resume session, observe banner-over-fading-body sequence.
- [ ] No new vitest asserting WAAPI behavior — happy-dom is the wrong substrate per the user's `feedback_no_happy_dom_tests` rule. The at0051 augmentation in Step 5 covers the integration.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run check`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test`
- [ ] Manual: `cd tugapp && just app-build && just app-run`, open a Tide card, hit Open with a fresh path; observe body fade.

#### Step 5: Augment at0051 — pin new-mode no-banner + click-to-caret budget {#step-5}

**Depends on:** [#step-2](#step-2), [#step-4](#step-4)

**Commit:** `tide(at0051): pin no-banner contract for new sessions`

**References:** Spec [S01](#s01-banner-spec-by-mode), Spec [S02](#s02-editor-focus-contract), [R01](#r01-resume-focus-regression), [V03](#v03-bannerdidhide-load-bearing)

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/app-test/at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts` carries new assertions for the new-mode bind path:
  - During the bind window, no element matching `[data-slot="tug-pane-banner"]` ever appears under the card.
  - The caret-layer becomes visible within a documented budget (target ≤ 800ms wall, with headroom for harness overhead).
- Existing resume-path assertions are preserved.
- Test docstring updated.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add a new-mode test path (separate `test()` block) that seeds a new-mode binding and waits for caret-layer presence while polling for banner absence.
- [ ] Adjust harness helpers if needed (`bindTideSession` may already accept a `sessionMode` param; if not, extend it minimally).
- [ ] Update the test's docstring: name the no-banner contract for new mode and the lifecycle-event focus contract for resume mode (carries forward).

**Tests:**
- [ ] `just app-test at0051-tide-mount-focus` — both new-mode and resume-mode assertions pass.
- [ ] Greppable `VERDICT: PASS` line at end of the recipe output (per the project's `feedback_just_app_test` rule).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `just app-test at0051-tide-mount-focus`

#### Step 6: Integration Checkpoint {#step-6}

**Depends on:** [#step-1](#step-1), [#step-2](#step-2), [#step-3](#step-3), [#step-4](#step-4), [#step-5](#step-5)

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [success-criteria](#success-criteria), Spec [S01](#s01-banner-spec-by-mode), Spec [S02](#s02-editor-focus-contract), Spec [S03](#s03-body-fade-in)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Verify all artifacts from Steps 1–5 are landed.
- [ ] Manually open a new Tide session: confirm sheet exits → body fades in → caret blinks; no banner ever appears.
- [ ] Manually resume a Tide session that has prior content: confirm sheet exits → body fades in → banner mounts over fading-in body → replay completes → banner exits → caret blinks.
- [ ] Manually trigger a banner-bearing condition outside the init path (e.g., transport disruption while body is mounted): confirm focus is restored after the banner exits.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Full vitest suite green.
- [ ] `just app-test at0051-tide-mount-focus` green.
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` green.
- [ ] `bun run audit:tokens lint` exits 0.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun run check && bun test`
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run`
- [ ] `just app-test at0051-tide-mount-focus`
- [ ] Manual smoke: new + resume + transport-disruption scenarios.

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** Click-to-caret on Tide-card Open feels coordinated and unhurried — no banner content for new sessions, a brief body fade-in, the caret blinking by the end of the picker→body handoff, and the focus contract documented in code so the next overlay author can read the rule before re-discovering it.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] For a new-mode binding, `<TugPaneBanner>` is never mounted during the bind→replay window. (verification: at0051 + manual)
- [ ] For a resume-mode binding, the banner mounts as today, exits when replay completes, and `bannerDidHide` re-claims focus exactly once. (verification: at0051 unchanged)
- [ ] `TideCardBody`'s root opacity ramps 0→1 over `--tug-motion-duration-moderate` exactly once on first mount. (verification: manual)
- [ ] The focus contract is documented at three call sites (`tide-card.tsx`, `tug-pane-banner.tsx`, `tug-sheet.tsx`) and pinned by `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts`. (verification: code review + test)
- [ ] All existing tests + new tests green; `-D warnings` enforced. (verification: CI)

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] `tide-card-banner-spec.test.ts` passes with new cases.
- [ ] `at0051-tide-mount-focus.test.ts` passes for both new-mode and resume-mode paths.
- [ ] Full vitest + nextest suites green.

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] Lift `<TugSheet>`'s React parent above the picker so `SHEET_EXIT_ANIMATION_MS` can be reduced or eliminated. Would let the sheet exit and body mount overlap honestly, removing the ~220ms gate on click-to-caret.
- [ ] Consider a `TideRestoring`-style backdrop variant for resume in place of the banner-over-empty-transcript pattern, so resume reads as "we're restoring this" rather than "look at the empty space while we load it."
- [ ] Add a contract test or lint that fails when an overlay sets `inert` on `.tug-pane-body` without also wiring a per-card `didHide` lifecycle event — turning the L24 invariant into a static check rather than a documented convention.

| Checkpoint | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| Banner suppressed for new sessions | `at0051` + manual; banner-spec unit tests |
| Focus contract documented | code review + at0051 |
| Body fade-in lands | manual smoke + at0051 caret-presence assertion |
| All tests green | `bun run check && bun test`, `cargo nextest run`, `just app-test at0051-tide-mount-focus`, `bun run audit:tokens lint` |
