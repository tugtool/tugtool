## Resume Performance 2 — Real Sessions Only {#resume-performance-2}

**Purpose:** Make resuming *real* sessions fast and visibly alive: every
measurement, fixture, and acceptance gate in this plan runs against actual
session JSONLs harvested from this machine, a resumed card shows progress from
its first moment, and no optimization is claimed until the win reproduces on
the real corpus. This plan supersedes `roadmap/resume-performance.md`, whose
synthetic prose-only fixtures validated its machinery while the first real
tool-heavy session still froze the deck ~20 seconds.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

The first resume-performance plan landed real, content-agnostic substrate —
pipeline instrumentation (Spec S02 of that plan; `getSessionPerf`), the
deck-side replay fold (one snapshot tick per flush), the unpaced translate
loop, a render-once parse cache for markdown prose, `content-visibility`
deferral, windowed transcript mounting with selection/focus pinning, and a
speculative warm queue. All of it was measured green — against synthesized
prose. The first real session resumed against it (`763cd1d8`, ~12MB, ~4,900
wire messages across ~46 committed cycles: **937 tool_use + 937 tool_result +
457 thinking + 346 text blocks**, a dozen >50KB) froze the deck **~20s in a
single React mount commit** with a blank card. The instrumentation itself
located the failure precisely: server side 420ms (boot 5ms, 12MB read 3ms,
translate 306ms, 4,923 frames forwarded with zero broadcast lag); everything
else was deck-side mount cost for content shapes the fixtures never contained.

What the synthetic plan never saw, now first-class here:

1. **Real sessions are tool-call machines.** ~107 message components per turn
   in the motivating session. Tool blocks are a full component family
   (`cards/tool-blocks/`: bash, edit, grep, glob, read, write, default, …)
   mounting input `JsonTreeBlock`s, result bodies (`TugMarkdownBlock` /
   code views), and chrome — none of it covered by the prose parse cache.
2. **The blank window is structural.** The cold-restore flow routes the whole
   window to the `DevRestoring` placeholder and holds `DevCardBody` unmounted
   until `replay_complete` (the restore-reveal coordination; the old
   `replay-loading` banner kind was deliberately retired). The reveal then
   mounts the entire transcript in ONE commit — on tool-heavy sessions the
   main thread freezes and whatever painted last (placeholder or nothing)
   stares back for the duration. The [DT10] `visibility: hidden` gate hides
   the transcript host during the window on top of that.
3. **The real population (surveyed 2026-06-12):** 1,198 sessions across 39
   project dirs, 1.85GB total. p50 17KB, p90 145KB, p99 15.5MB, **max 626MB**;
   65 sessions >1MB, 16 >10MB. The 626MB class would trip
   `REPLAY_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS` (10s) on bridge throughput (~25MB/s) alone.

Ken's product ruling folded in: **historical (replayed) tool blocks render
collapsed — header-only chrome; the body materializes on expand.** The same
collapsing is expected for live sessions later (the inline transcript is too
noisy), but live stays out of scope here.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **The corpus is the ground truth.** Step one harvests and classifies the
  real population; every later step baselines and re-measures against those
  snapshots. The synthetic prose generators are deleted from the test suite.
- **Measure on real content before optimizing** — the surviving
  instrumentation already proved it can name the cost (it found the 20s).
  The baseline decides what the render work actually is; this plan
  pre-commits only to the two mechanisms already demanded by evidence and
  product ruling: collapsed historical tool bodies and a progressive,
  feedback-bearing reveal.
- **Visible progress is a success criterion**, not a nicety. A resuming card
  paints something honest immediately and updates as the transcript builds.
  "Fast" alone fails the requirement.
- **No win is claimed until it reproduces on the corpus.** The per-resume
  waterfall on real sessions is the acceptance test for every step.
- **Keep the landed substrate.** Fold, windowing, prose cache, warm queue,
  instrumentation all stay; this plan extends them to real shapes rather
  than relitigating them.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

Budgets are per corpus class (see [P04]); the named targets below harden
after the baseline step records real numbers and are checked on REAL
snapshots, not generators:

- **Typical class (p50–p90, ≤~150KB):** transcript committed within ~500ms
  of Open on the dev machine.
- **Heavy class (1–20MB, tool-dominated — includes `763cd1d8`):** first
  visible transcript content well under 1s; fully settled ≤ ~2.5s; never a
  frozen main thread long enough to read as a hang.
- **Whale class (>20MB up to the 626MB monster):** resumes progressively
  with continuous feedback, no replay-timeout trips, bounded memory; wall
  budget set from baseline data ([Q03]).
- **Feedback:** from Open to first content, the card always shows a live
  affordance (placeholder → progress → progressive transcript); no
  blank-card interval at any class — and the affordance is informative
  from t=0 (title / turn count / size from the picker row, per Spec S03),
  not just animated.
- **Collapsed history:** replayed tool blocks mount header-only; expanding
  one materializes its body on demand; expansion state survives scrolling
  (windowed unmount/remount) and cold boot (the [A9] bag carries it).
- **Parse/mount-once discipline extends to tool blocks:** an expanded body's
  expensive derivations compute once per block per session.
- All assertions land in corpus-driven app-tests with machine-insensitive
  counters as the CI teeth and generous wall ceilings.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. Corpus harvest + classification tooling and a gitignored local corpus.
2. Corpus baseline: per-class waterfalls recorded in this plan; the
   blank-card mechanism pinned exactly.
3. Collapsed historical tool blocks (header-only mount, body on expand,
   expansion state on the existing collapse + [A9] contracts).
4. Progressive reveal + replay progress UX (restore-reveal and [DT10] gate
   reworked for windowed transcripts).
5. Residual render-cost work as the re-baseline demands (gated).
6. Fixture-suite conversion: corpus legs as the default, prose generators
   deleted, budget gates per class.
7. Whale-tier policy (gated): timeout, memory, progressive budget for the
   >20MB class.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- **Collapsing live-turn tool blocks.** Expected follow-on (the transcript
  is too noisy live, too) — designed not to be precluded, but not built here.
- **Re-opening the landed substrate** (fold, windowing, translate pacing,
  prose cache) except where corpus numbers demand tuning.
- **Committing session content to git.** The corpus stays local and
  gitignored; only tooling, manifests of shape metadata, and generators
  derived from shape statistics are committed.
- **Cross-session persistence of parse/render caches.**

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- The joined first plan (`roadmap/resume-performance.md`, squash
  `919452f2`): instrumentation (`logSessionLifecycle` perf events,
  `getSessionPerf` test surface), replay fold, windowed mounting
  (row + message-weight thresholds), render-once prose cache, warm queue,
  at0182/at0183/at0184 harness patterns.
- The supersession contract recorded at
  `roadmap/resume-performance.md#superseded`.
- `~/.claude/projects/` as the live population (1,198 sessions surveyed).
- Tool-block component family under
  `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tool-blocks/`.
- Restore-reveal coordination (`DevRestoring`, restore registry) and the
  [DT10] transcript paint gate.

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- **Tuglaws:** [L02] store→React only via `useSyncExternalStore`; [L05]/[L13]
  no rAF for render-coupled work; [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM; [L23]
  selection/focus/scroll/expansion survive windowing and reveal changes;
  [L26] mount identity stable across collapse→expand and window membership.
  Cross-check tuglaws before each tugdeck step; name touched laws in commits.
- **Warnings are errors** in the Rust workspace; bun for tugdeck; tugcode is
  a compiled binary (rebuild to test); tugdeck is HMR-live.
- Corpus app-test legs must skip cleanly (not fail) on a machine without a
  harvested corpus; the always-runnable gates use the committed real-shape
  generator.
- Privacy: harvested snapshots and manifests carrying session content stay
  out of git by construction (gitignore + harvest-tool defaults).

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The corpus classes are stable enough that a snapshot set harvested once
  (refreshable by re-running the tool) represents the population.
- Tool-block mount cost dominates the heavy class; the baseline either
  confirms or re-ranks ([P01] discipline — gated steps cite its numbers).
- Collapsed-by-default history is acceptable UX for ALL replayed tool blocks
  (Ken's ruling), with expansion as the recovery path.

### Reference and Anchor Conventions (MANDATORY) {#reference-conventions}

Per `tuglaws/devise-skeleton.md`: explicit kebab-case `{#anchor}` headings;
plan-local decisions `[P##]`, open questions `[Q##]`, specs `S##`, risks
`R##` — two digits, never reused; steps cite labels and anchors, never line
numbers; `**Depends on:**` lines reference real step anchors.

---

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] What exactly paints (and when) between Open and first content today? (OPEN → resolve in #step-2) {#q01-blank-window}

**Question:** In the picker→Open flow (vs cold-boot restore), does
`DevRestoring` mount at all? When does the placeholder hand off, what does
the [DT10] gate hide, and which commit freezes the thread on heavy sessions?
The motivating report saw a blank card for ~20s; the mechanism must be
pinned per flow before the reveal rework.

**Plan to resolve:** #step-2 instruments the reveal chain (placeholder
mount/unmount, body mount, gate drop, first transcript paint) on real
snapshots from both entry flows. Code-reading expectation to confirm:
`DevCardServicesGate`'s `deriveColdRestoreActive` + one-shot `revealed`
latch key off "preflight → replaying before first body mount", which a
picker-opened resume also walks — likely ONE gate, TWO entry paths, which
would simplify #step-4's rework.

**Resolution:** OPEN.

#### [Q02] What does a collapsed tool-block header show? {#q02-collapsed-header}

**Question:** Header-only mount needs a digest: tool name + status is the
floor; a one-line input summary (command, file path, pattern) is likely
wanted. Which body-bits are cheap enough to keep in the header, per tool?

**Plan to resolve:** #step-3 designs the header digest per tool family in
the gallery first (the per-tool wrappers already centralize chrome);
cheapness is checked by the corpus re-measurement.

**Resolution:** OPEN (resolved by #step-3's gallery + measurement pass).

#### [Q03] What is achievable for the whale class (>20MB, up to 626MB)? (OPEN → gates #step-7) {#q03-whale-class}

**Question:** Bridge throughput (~25MB/s measured) puts a 626MB session
~25s server-side — past `REPLAY_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS` (10s). What budget,
timeout policy, and memory bound does this class get; is partial/most-recent
replay the right product shape?

**Plan to resolve:** #step-2 baselines the whale snapshots (timeout trips
included — a trip is data); #step-7 sets policy from those numbers.

**Resolution:** OPEN (gates #step-7).

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Corpus snapshots leak into git | high | low | gitignored corpus dir created by the harvest tool; manifest content-free by default; review at commit time ([R01]) | any corpus path in `git status` |
| Collapsed history hides information users relied on | med | med | header digest per tool ([Q02]); one-click expand; expansion state survives scroll ([R02]) | user feedback after build |
| Expansion state lost on windowed unmount ([L23]) | med | med | [A9] preservation keyed by toolUseId restores at mount — the same mechanism covers cold boot ([R02], Spec S02) | expand → scroll away → back loses state |
| Reveal rework reintroduces scroll jumps / FOUC the gate existed to stop | high | med | progressive reveal only under windowed mounting (bounded commits); follow-bottom anchoring; [L26] audit at each transition ([R03]) | any restore scroll jump |
| Baseline re-ranks costs and the pre-committed mechanisms underdeliver | med | low | [P01]: gated residual step (#step-5) exists precisely for what baseline names; collapse + reveal are demanded by evidence already ([R04]) | heavy-class budget missed after #step-3/#step-4 |
| Corpus tests flake on machine variance | med | med | counters as CI teeth, generous ceilings; corpus legs skip (not fail) without a corpus ([R05]) | flaky leg |

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] The real corpus is the only measurement substrate (DECIDED) {#p01-corpus-only}

**Decision:** A committed harvest tool surveys `~/.claude/projects/`,
classifies every session (size tier; shape: tool-heavy / thinking-heavy /
image-bearing / prose; turn and message counts), and snapshots a
representative set — including `763cd1d8` — into a **gitignored** local
corpus with a manifest. Corpus-driven app-test legs are the default
measurement and acceptance path and skip cleanly when no corpus exists.
The synthetic prose generators in at0182/at0183/at0184 are deleted; the
one retained generator is the real-shape tool-heavy generator (kept as the
always-runnable CI gate), with its parameters re-derived from corpus
statistics.

**Rationale:** Synthetic fixtures validated machinery, not workload —
measured wins, unrepresentative reality. (Recorded in the supersession
contract and in auto-memory.)

**Implications:** Tests carry a corpus-resolution helper (locate corpus dir,
read manifest, pick class representatives); CI without a corpus still gates
on the real-shape generator leg.

#### [P02] Historical tool blocks render collapsed; bodies materialize on expand (DECIDED — Ken) {#p02-collapsed-history}

**Decision:** Replayed (committed-history) tool blocks mount header-only
chrome — tool icon/name, status, caution badges, and a per-tool one-line
digest ([Q02]). The body (input trees, result bodies, code views) is NOT
constructed at mount; expanding the block materializes it on demand, and the
expensive derivations behind it compute once per block per session
(render-once discipline extended to tool content). Collapse state rides the
EXISTING contracts per Spec S02 — the host-owned `collapsed` boolean lifted
to the Layer-2 wrapper, persisted through the [A9] preservation protocol
keyed by `tool_use_id` — so expansion survives windowed unmount/remount
([L23]) and cold boot with one mechanism and no new store. Live-turn tool
blocks are unchanged in this plan; the same collapsing is expected for live
later (transcript noise), so the mechanism must not assume
"historical-only" structurally.

**Rationale:** The heavy class's mount bill is thousands of tool-block
bodies nobody is looking at; the product ruling makes the cheap path also
the desired presentation.

**Implications:** [L26] — collapse→expand must not change the block's mount
identity (same key, same component type; the body is a child that appears).
A new gallery fixture family covers collapsed/expanded states per tool.

#### [P03] Progressive reveal with always-on feedback (DECIDED) {#p03-progressive-reveal}

**Decision:** The all-or-nothing restore reveal is replaced for replays:
the card body and transcript mount early; under windowed mounting the
transcript paints progressively as fold flushes commit (the 250-event
threshold flushes are the progress ticks — event-driven, no timers, no
rAF); a progress affordance (e.g. "Restoring — N turns…", derived from the
store at flush commits, plus a compositor-driven indeterminate animation
between commits) is visible from the first moment and is replaced by
content, never by blank. The [DT10] `visibility:hidden` gate is retired or
narrowed to the inline (small) class where the window is sub-perceptual;
follow-bottom anchoring holds the scroll at the live edge across flushes.
`DevRestoring` remains the pre-body placeholder but hands off to the
progressive surface as soon as the body can mount.

**Rationale:** "It can't work like this" — feedback is a requirement.
A frozen 20s commit cannot paint progress by definition, so the reveal must
be made of SMALL commits (windowing + collapse give exactly that) before
any progress text can matter.

**Implications:** [L23] — the reveal rework must preserve the scroll-restore
behavior the old gate protected (no FOUC, no anchor jumps); [Q01]'s findings
drive the exact handoff points; the progress affordance reads store state
via [L02] (no new timers).

#### [P04] Budgets are per corpus class (DECIDED) {#p04-class-budgets}

**Decision:** The corpus manifest assigns every snapshot a class (typical /
heavy / whale, with shape tags); budgets and acceptance gates are stated and
asserted per class. The baseline step replaces this plan's provisional
targets with measured-and-chosen numbers recorded under
`#corpus-baseline`.

#### [P05] The landed substrate stays; extensions must earn their place on corpus numbers (DECIDED) {#p05-keep-substrate}

**Decision:** Fold, windowed mounting (incl. the message-weight stopgap),
prose parse cache, warm queue, and all instrumentation remain. Residual
render-cost work beyond [P02]/[P03] (e.g. JsonTree depth bounds for huge
inputs, code-view highlight deferral, warm-queue coverage for tool digests)
proceeds only where the post-collapse re-baseline still shows a hot spot
(#step-5, gated).

---

### Specification {#specification}

**Spec S01: Corpus harvest tool and manifest** {#s01-corpus-harvest}

- A bun script (committed, e.g. `tests/app-test/corpus/harvest.ts`) that:
  surveys every `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl`; computes per-session stats
  (bytes, lines, turns, wire-message estimate, content-block histogram —
  tool_use/tool_result/thinking/text/image, largest-block size); assigns
  class + shape tags; writes `manifest.json` and materializes a selected
  representative set under `tests/app-test/corpus/snapshots/` with
  per-record `cwd` rewritten at seed time (the at0182 temp-project pattern).
- **Materialization strategy is per-class, recorded in the manifest:**
  typical and heavy snapshots are copied (stable against the live session
  changing underfoot); whale-class snapshots (>20MB — the 626MB monster
  would double ~0.6GB of disk per refresh) are hardlinked or referenced
  in place, with the manifest carrying `{strategy, source_path, size,
  mtime}` so a runner can detect a drifted reference and re-harvest.
- `tests/app-test/corpus/` (manifest + snapshots) is **gitignored**; the
  script and a `README` documenting refresh are committed.
- Selection: per class × shape, newest representative plus pinned ids
  (always includes `763cd1d8`); the survey table (population counts per
  class) is recorded in this plan.
- **Live-session tolerance:** skip sessions a terminal currently holds
  (the `~/.claude/sessions/` registry is the authority) and tolerate
  mid-write reads everywhere — JSONL is append-only, so a torn final
  line parses as one skipped record, same as the translator's policy.

**Spec S02: Collapse state rides the EXISTING contracts — no new store** {#s02-expansion-state}

- The codebase already owns this concern twice over, and [P02] builds on
  both rather than adding a third mechanism:
  1. **Host-owned collapse** — the body-kind contract
     (`cards/tool-blocks/types.ts`) defines `collapsed` +
     `onToggleCollapsed` with the explicit rule that the body never owns
     its own boolean. [P02] LIFTS the owned boolean to the Layer-2
     per-tool wrapper, where collapsed means the body subtree is **not
     mounted at all** (the perf point — today's body-level collapse still
     constructs the body component), and the wrapper renders the header
     digest in its place.
  2. **Persistence via [A9]** — the Component State Preservation Protocol
     (`componentStatePreservationKey` → `bag.components`) is the codified
     home for exactly this state class ("collapsed, inner scroll
     position…"). Each wrapper keys its expansion boolean by
     `tool_use_id`. Mount-time restore covers BOTH hazards with one
     mechanism: windowed unmount → remount within a session ([L23]) and
     cold boot / pane restore across sessions. Default-collapsed blocks
     write no entry, so a 900-block transcript adds only the handful of
     expanded keys to the bag.
- Body materialization on expand parses/derives through the existing
  render-once chokepoints so a re-collapse → re-expand is a cache hit.

**Spec S03: Replay progress affordance** {#s03-progress}

- **The wait has three segments and only one produces deck events.**
  (1) Open → first frame: spawn + `request_replay` + read + translate —
  several hundred ms on the heavy class with NOTHING arriving at the deck;
  (2) ingest: fold flushes tick every 250 events (brief); (3) the windowed
  mount commits. The affordance must be informative across all three, so:
- **t=0 data comes from the picker row, not the wire.** The picker already
  knows `turn_count`, file size, and the title for the selected session —
  thread that metadata through the open/restore expectation (the
  `devRestoreRegistry` entry already carries `projectDir`; extend it) so
  the placeholder reads "Restoring <title> — 106 turns (12MB)…" from the
  first paint, before any frame exists.
- During ingest, transcript turn count read from the store snapshot at
  fold-flush commits updates the line ([L02] — the flush notify is the
  only render-coupled signal). Between events at every segment, a
  CSS/compositor indeterminate animation keeps motion without JS ticks
  ([L06]).
- Surface: a slim strip or placeholder line in the transcript region
  (exact chrome designed in-step against the gallery), visible from body
  mount until the window closes.
- No timers, no rAF anywhere in the affordance.

#### State Zone Mapping (tugdeck/tugways plans) {#state-zone-mapping}

| State | Zone | Mechanism | Law |
|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| Tool-block expansion boolean | local-data (wrapper-owned, [A9]-persisted) | host-owned `collapsed` on the Layer-2 wrapper; `componentStatePreservationKey` = `tool_use_id` per Spec S02 | [L24], [L23] |
| Collapsed-body materialization | render-derived | body subtree appears under the SAME block mount on expand | [L26] |
| Replay progress data | existing store snapshot | read at fold-flush commits via `useSyncExternalStore` | [L02] |
| Progress animation between flushes | appearance | CSS indeterminate animation | [L06], [L05]/[L13] honored |
| Reveal/paint gating | appearance | CSS / mount-order, no React state for paint | [L06], [L23] |

### Deep Dive: Implementation Anchors {#implementation-anchors}

Symbol/path map for the implementing session — everything here was
verified by reading the code or by measurement during planning (no line
numbers by convention; symbols are greppable):

**Reveal chain (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/dev-card.tsx`):**
`DevCardContent` routes unbound cards (restore registry →
`DevRestoring variant="binding"`, `restorePassGate` → `"pass-pending"`,
else picker). `DevCardServicesGate` routes bound cards: `transportState
=== "restoring"` or (`deriveColdRestoreActive` && one-shot `revealed`
latch not yet flipped) → `DevRestoring`; else `DevCardBody`. The latch +
`deriveColdRestoreActive` are the exact surface #step-4 reworks; the
docstring's own words — body "mounts exactly once, against a fully
reconstructed transcript, and reveals in a single paint" — describe the
freeze being removed.

**Transcript (`cards/dev-card-transcript.tsx`):** `DevTranscriptHost`;
the `windowedTranscript` [L02] boolean selector with
`WINDOWED_TRANSCRIPT_ROW_THRESHOLD` (1200) and
`WINDOWED_TRANSCRIPT_MESSAGE_THRESHOLD` (600); the [DT10]
`data-replaying` → `visibility:hidden` gate on the host root; cell memo
gate `transcriptCellPropsEqual` + `sameTranscriptRowData` in
`lib/dev-transcript-data-source.ts` (cells take a resolved `row` prop —
comparators cannot read live state). `CodeRowBody` iterates
`turn.messages` and dispatches kinds; tool calls route through
`dispatchToolCallState` (`cards/dev-assistant-renderer-dispatch.ts`).

**Fold + counters (`lib/code-session-store.ts`):** `dispatch(event,
origin)` — wire-origin events defer notifies while `phase ===
"replaying"`; `_publishAndNotify` / `_flushReplayFold`;
`REPLAY_FOLD_FLUSH_THRESHOLD` (250) — the progress affordance's tick.
Perf: `_getPerfForDevPanel` (replay/lastReplay/liveTurn/lastLiveTurn),
`getSessionPerf(cardId)` on `window.__tug` (SURFACE_VERSION 1.12.0).
The warm queue is fed from the `write-inflight` effect (text channels,
replay window only).

**Render-once (`lib/markdown/`):** `parse-cache.ts` — `ensureParsed`
is THE chokepoint (render path + warm queue share it; options identical
by construction); `warm-queue.ts` (LIFO, 8ms slices, `setTimeout`-class);
`parse-counters.ts` (`parses/cacheHits/memoHits`,
`maxParsesPerIdentity === 1` is the parse-once assertion).

**Tool blocks (`cards/tool-blocks/`):** Layer-2 per-tool wrappers
(bash/edit/grep/glob/read/write/default/…); `types.ts` carries the
host-owned collapse contract (`collapsed` + `onToggleCollapsed`) and the
[A9] `componentStatePreservationKey` — Spec S02 builds on exactly these.
`chrome/dev-thinking-block.tsx`: default-collapsed on complete is a CSS
`data-collapsed` flip — body still mounts/parses (the #step-5 candidate).

**Measured facts (don't re-derive):** bridge throughput ≈25MB/s (53MB
session = ~2.2s server-side end-to-end; translate itself is 42ms
unpaced in-memory); zero broadcast lag at 16k frames (capacity 1024);
`REPLAY_HARD_TIMEOUT_MS` = 10s in tugcode; medium-synthetic post-plan-1
wall ≈0.8s with server ≈25ms of it; the motivating real session
(`763cd1d8`): server 420ms, deck ~19.6s in the single mount commit.
Prior baselines: `roadmap/resume-performance.md#baseline-numbers`.

**Harness lore (hard-won — do not rediscover):** drive the picker via
the recents MOUNT-SEED (the path field auto-fills from the first
recent; the at0181-style Tab→Tab→Enter reliably triggers the picker's
Enter fall-through, which opens a NEW session and dismisses the picker —
recorded follow-up bug); readiness predicates must be windowed-aware
(≥1 mounted user row + `lastReplay !== null`, never "all rows mounted");
a wedged WebView defeats the harness's own RPC timeouts — bun's outer
test timeout is the only backstop, so legs that can wedge must be
skipped-by-default with their numbers recorded; `just app-test` only
builds the apptest bundle when it is ABSENT — `just app-test-build`
forces a rebuild after Rust/tugcode/Swift changes (tugdeck rides the
recipe's dist refresh).

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Corpus app-tests** (`just app-test`) | per-class budgets, waterfall acceptance, reveal/feedback assertions, expansion-survival ([L23]) — `skipIf` no corpus | the default acceptance path |
| **Real-shape generator leg** | the always-runnable CI gate (tool-heavy shape, parameters from corpus stats) | machines without a corpus |
| **Pure-logic (bun)** | wrapper collapse logic; header-digest derivations; harvest classifier; progress derivation | stores + tooling |
| **Gallery fixtures** | collapsed/expanded tool-block states per tool family | [Q02] design + visual review |

Banned (house rules): fake-DOM/RTL tests; mock-store call-count tests;
tight wall-clock CI gates (counters are the teeth; ceilings stay generous).
Prose generators are deleted, not deprecated.

**References:** [P01], Spec S01, (#context, #s01-corpus-harvest)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement the harvest script + classifier per Spec S01; gitignore the corpus dir
- [ ] Run it; record the population/class survey table in this plan
- [ ] Pin `763cd1d8` and at least one snapshot per class × shape

**Tests:**
- [ ] Pure-logic: classifier over hand-built JSONL samples (class + shape tags, histogram math)
- [ ] Harvest dry-run mode produces a manifest without copying (safety)

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Corpus dir populated locally; `git status` clean of corpus content
- [ ] Survey table committed into this plan with real counts

---

#### Step 2: Corpus baseline + reveal-chain audit {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `Baseline resume on the real corpus; pin the reveal chain`

**References:** [P01], [P04], [Q01], (#corpus-baseline, #q01-blank-window)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Corpus runner app-test (at0185-class): resume each selected snapshot through the real picker flow; record per-class waterfalls (server splits, ingest, reveal timestamps, wall) under `#corpus-baseline`
- [ ] Instrument + record the reveal chain ([Q01]): `DevRestoring` mount/handoff, body mount, [DT10] drop, first transcript paint — for picker→Open AND cold-boot restore
- [ ] Whale snapshots included; timeout trips recorded as data ([Q03])
- [ ] Harden the [P04] class budgets from the measured numbers (edit #success-criteria)

**Tests:**
- [ ] The corpus runner itself (skipIf no corpus), printing per-class `CORPUS ...` lines

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Baseline tables in this plan; [Q01] resolved with the measured chain; budgets hardened

---

#### Step 3: Collapsed historical tool blocks {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `Collapse replayed tool blocks: header digest + body on expand (L26, L23, L02)`

**References:** [P02], Spec S02, [Q02], Risk R02, (#state-zone-mapping)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Header digest per tool family ([Q02]) — gallery fixtures first (collapsed + expanded per tool); digest derivation must be render-path cheap (no full parse of a 50KB input to produce one line)
- [ ] Lift the host-owned `collapsed` boolean to the Layer-2 wrapper per Spec S02; body-on-expand materialization under stable mount identity ([L26]); derivations through render-once chokepoints
- [ ] [A9] persistence keyed by `tool_use_id`; survival across windowed unmount/remount AND cold boot ([L23])
- [ ] Re-measure the corpus heavy class; update `#corpus-baseline`

**Tests:**
- [ ] Pure-logic: header digests per tool over real-shape inputs (incl. oversized payloads)
- [ ] Pure-logic: wrapper collapse logic (default-collapsed for history; toggle round trip)
- [ ] Corpus app-test: heavy-class resume meets its hardened budget; expand → scroll away → back retains state

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit`; gallery review clean
- [ ] Heavy-class corpus re-measurement shows the mount bill collapsed (recorded)

---

#### Step 4: Progressive reveal + progress affordance {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-2, #step-3

**Commit:** `Reveal resumed transcripts progressively with always-on progress (L02, L06, L23)`

**References:** [P03], Spec S03, [Q01], Risk R03, (#s03-progress)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Rework the restore-reveal handoff per [Q01]'s findings: body mounts early; transcript paints at fold flushes under windowed mounting; retire/narrow the [DT10] gate
- [ ] Progress affordance per Spec S03 (no timers, no rAF); follow-bottom anchoring across flushes
- [ ] Verify no FOUC / scroll jump on every corpus class (the old gate's job)
- [ ] Re-measure; record reveal timestamps per class

**Tests:**
- [ ] Pure-logic: progress derivation from snapshots
- [ ] Corpus app-test: no blank interval — an affordance or content is present at every sampled moment between Open and settled; first-content timestamp within class budget

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Heavy-class: first visible content < 1s on the dev machine; recorded

---

#### Step 5: Residual render-cost work (gated) {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-3, #step-4

**Commit:** `Burn down the remaining corpus hot spots` *(or close as not-needed with numbers)*

**References:** [P05], [P01], (#corpus-baseline)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Gate check on the post-#step-4 corpus waterfalls; name the residue (candidates: JsonTree depth bounds, code-view highlight deferral, digest warm coverage, **historical thinking blocks** — `DevThinkingBlock` is default-collapsed on complete but only via a CSS `data-collapsed` flip: the markdown body still mounts and parses; 457 of them in the motivating session. If the numbers say so, give them the same body-on-expand treatment as [P02])
- [ ] Re-scope the speculative warm queue for the collapsed world: digests in, bodies out — the replay-window feed currently warms tool-result markdown that collapsed history may never render; decide keep/trim from the measured hit rates
- [ ] Implement only what the numbers demand; re-measure

**Tests:**
- [ ] If proceeding: pure-logic tests for each mechanism that lands; the corpus heavy-class leg re-asserts its budget

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Class budgets met across the corpus, or close-out recorded with numbers

---

#### Step 6: Fixture-suite conversion to the corpus {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `Make real-shape fixtures the test default; delete the prose generators`

**References:** [P01], Risk R05, (#test-plan-concepts)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Delete the synthetic prose generators from at0182/at0183/at0184; re-ground their surviving assertions on corpus legs + the real-shape generator
- [ ] Re-derive the real-shape generator's parameters from corpus statistics (message mix, sizes)
- [ ] Ensure corpus legs `skipIf` cleanly; generator legs remain the always-runnable gates

**Tests:**
- [ ] The converted suite itself: full `just app-test` of the resume files green with and without a corpus present

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] No prose generator remains (grep-verifiable); suite green both ways

---

#### Step 7: Whale-class policy (gated by [Q03]) {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-2, #step-4

**Commit:** `Set the whale-class resume policy` *(shape per [Q03]'s numbers)*

**References:** [Q03], [P04], (#q03-whale-class)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Decide policy from baseline data: timeout restructure vs progressive/partial replay vs explicit ceiling with messaging; implement the chosen shape
- [ ] Memory bound verified on the largest snapshots

**Tests:**
- [ ] Corpus app-test: largest snapshots resume per policy (no silent hang, no timeout surprise)

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Whale snapshots behave per recorded policy; numbers in the plan

---

#### Step 8: Integration: corpus acceptance sweep {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-3, #step-4, #step-5, #step-6, #step-7

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [P01]–[P05], (#success-criteria)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Full corpus sweep against the hardened budgets; every class green or its gated close-out recorded
- [ ] Full suites: `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run`; `cd tugdeck && bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit`; `cd tugcode && bun test`; resume app-tests `VERDICT: PASS`

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] All of the above green; final per-class table recorded in this plan

---

### Corpus Baseline (filled by #step-2) {#corpus-baseline}

*(survey table from #step-1 and per-class waterfalls from #step-2 land
here; re-measurements from #step-3/#step-4/#step-5 append below them)*

---

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** Resume that is fast and visibly alive on the user's actual
sessions: a harvested real corpus as the permanent measurement substrate,
collapsed historical tool blocks, a progressive reveal with always-on
feedback, per-class budgets asserted by corpus-driven tests, and a recorded
policy for every class up to the 626MB monster.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] Corpus harvested, classified, gitignored; survey + baselines recorded in this plan
- [ ] Heavy class (incl. `763cd1d8`): first content < 1s, settled within its hardened budget, zero blank intervals — measured on the real snapshots
- [ ] Replayed tool blocks collapsed with working, state-preserving expansion
- [ ] Prose generators deleted; corpus legs are the default acceptance path
- [ ] Whale-class policy implemented and recorded
- [ ] No rAF, no timer-driven render scheduling introduced (grep-verifiable)
- [ ] Full suites green; resume app-tests `VERDICT: PASS`

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] Collapse live-turn tool blocks (the noise problem — same mechanism, live policy TBD)
- [ ] Corpus refresh automation (periodic re-harvest)
- [ ] Render-once reuse for the rewind sheet's preview

| Checkpoint | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| Rust suites | `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run` |
| Frontend suites | `cd tugdeck && bun test && bunx tsc --noEmit` |
| Bridge suite | `cd tugcode && bun test` |
| End to end | `just app-test` resume files → `VERDICT: PASS` |
