## Tide session wake after spontaneous external trigger {#tide-session-wake}

**Purpose:** Tide's transcript paints assistant turns that resume claude from idle — Monitor timeouts, Bash/Task `run_in_background` completions, and harness-fired `ScheduleWakeup` / `CronCreate` timers. Without this work, claude continues processing the wake on its side but the resumed text never reaches the user's screen.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

When claude is between turns and goes idle, certain tools can resume it without a user submission:

- **Monitor** — when the watched file matches or the timeout fires
- **Bash** / **Task** with `run_in_background:true` — when the background process exits (and claude idle-waits rather than actively polling via BashOutput/TaskOutput)
- **ScheduleWakeup** — when the requested delay elapses
- **CronCreate** — when the registered cron expression matches the current time

Each of these resumes claude with a synthetic user_message that drives an assistant turn. Tide must show that turn in the transcript.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- tugcode is the wake detector — observe claude's stream-json stdout, recognize wake-bracket signals, emit a single `wake_started` IPC frame to tugdeck.
- tugdeck's reducer treats `wake_started` as the start of a new turn (a `waking` phase) that closes implicitly on the next `turn_complete`.
- One bracket on the wire for two distinct wake-trigger sources (in-invocation task notifications and harness-fired re-inits) — the reducer cannot tell them apart and doesn't need to.
- Transcript treats wake turns as single-row entries (the wake carries no user-typed text, so there is no "You" bubble to render).
- No tugcode-side scheduler. Claude Code's built-in scheduler is the source of truth for ScheduleWakeup / CronCreate timing; tugcode only reacts to its fire signal.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- A Monitor invocation with a 5-second timeout paints its resumed text in the transcript without reopening the session.
- A `ScheduleWakeup delaySeconds:60` paints its wake response in the transcript (at the next minute boundary after `now+60s`, per the harness's documented behavior).
- A `CronCreate` (one-shot and recurring) paints each scheduled fire as a wake turn; the user's CronDelete cancels further fires.
- No wake turn renders with a phantom "You" bubble above it.
- The user can interrupt a runaway wake turn via the Stop affordance.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. tugcode wake detection for in-invocation tools (Monitor / Bash runbg idle / Task runbg idle) — `system/task_notification` arm.
2. tugcode wake detection for harness-fired tools (ScheduleWakeup / CronCreate) — `system/init` re-bracket arm.
3. tugdeck reducer + store wrapper handling of the `wake_started` bracket and its `waking → idle` close on `turn_complete`.
4. Transcript data source treats wake turns as single-row entries.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Surfacing the wake's trigger in transcript chrome ("Resumed by Monitor t-abc"). Deferred to Slice 2 ([Q02]).
- Rendering the synthetic prompt claude received from its scheduler. The user-visible artifact is claude's response; the prompt is internal. Slice 2 may surface it.
- Durable scheduling across tugcode subprocess restart. Harness scheduling is session-scoped by Anthropic's design (*"dies when Claude exits"*); we match that.
- Cross-session wake delivery (Routines, Desktop scheduled tasks, etc.). Anthropic ships those separately.
- Tugcode-initiated cancellation of harness-scheduled tasks from the Tide UI. The user can ask claude to call `CronDelete`.

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- Claude Code v2.1.150 or compatible (the Cron* tools require v2.1.72+; `system/task_notification` shape pinned against `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/sdk.d.ts:1659-1668`).
- `tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/` captures of claude's stream-json wire (committed; reproducible via `probe-harness.mjs`).

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- tugcode invokes claude with `--input-format=stream-json --output-format=stream-json --verbose --include-partial-messages --replay-user-messages`. The detector and the bracket close design must operate on the wire shape that mode produces.
- The `wake_started` IPC frame and `WakeTrigger` snapshot field are camelCase tugdeck-side, snake_case tugcode-side. Translate at the reducer boundary.
- tugcode is bun-compiled to a standalone binary (`bun build --compile`). Source edits require an explicit rebuild — there is no HMR.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The harness scheduler's `system/init` fire signal is a reliable contract for Cohort B. The pattern is empirically observed (`tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/capture-*.stdout`) but not in published SDK documentation. A future Claude Code release that alters the pattern would surface here.
- `system/task_notification` fields used today (`task_id`, `tool_use_id`, `status`, `summary`, `output_file`) remain on the wire. The SDK type declares all of these except `tool_use_id`; the wire emits all five.

---

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Cohort taxonomy (RESOLVED) {#q01-cohorts}

**Question:** Which tools produce wake turns, and what wire signal does tugcode observe for each?

**Resolution:** Three cohorts, two distinct wire signals:

| Cohort | Tools | Wire signal | Handler |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A — in-invocation async** | Monitor; Bash `run_in_background:true` (idle); Task `run_in_background:true` (idle) | `system/task_notification` between turns | `handleTaskNotification` |
| **B — harness re-invoke** | ScheduleWakeup; CronCreate | A fresh `system/init` between turns (claude's built-in scheduler fired its timer) | `handleWakeReInit` |
| **C — not wake sources** | PushNotification (sync outbound); TaskOutput (blocking wait); Task/Bash `run_in_background:true` WITH active poll | n/a | none |

Empirical capture data at `tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/capture-sw-60-*.stdout` and `capture-cron-1m-*.stdout` plus `tugrust/.../v2.1.150-spike/test-{monitor-wake,bash-runbg-wake,task-runbg-idle-wake}.jsonl`.

#### [Q02] Should the wake turn's chrome show what triggered it? (DEFERRED to Slice 2) {#q02-trigger-chrome}

**Question:** When a wake turn paints, should the transcript carry a visible "Resumed by X" cue?

**Plan:** Ship without the cue; gather feedback; decide whether Slice 2 introduces a chrome variant. The `WakeTrigger` snapshot field is already populated for Cohort A (carries `task_id`, `tool_use_id`, `summary`, etc.) so a chrome layer can read it. For Cohort B the wire carries no trigger metadata; Slice 2 would have to thread it from the originating `ScheduleWakeup` / `CronCreate` tool_use payload.

Field signal (Session 3702c898): user noted the Stop button flips on during a wake even though the user did not initiate the turn. Slice 2 chrome should treat wake-initiated turns as a distinct visual class (still interruptible per [Q03], but the chrome signals "spontaneous").

#### [Q03] How should interrupt behave during a wake? (RESOLVED) {#q03-interrupt-during-wake}

**Question:** If the user clicks Stop while a wake turn is streaming, what happens?

**Resolution:** `canInterrupt` is true during `phase === "waking"`. The interrupt frame is identical in shape to a user-initiated interrupt — there is no pending user_message to discard, so the implementation simplification is to call the existing interrupt path. The wake's `turn_complete` (or `turn_cancelled`) closes the bracket.

---

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code release changes the `system/init` re-emit pattern (e.g., adds a new mid-turn re-init context that's neither compact nor wake) | low | high | Cohort B detector lives in one place (`handleClaudeLine`). The disambiguation rule is "between-turn re-init = wake, mid-turn re-init = not wake" — pinned by `tugcode/src/__tests__/wake-reinit.test.ts`. Step 4 adds a fixture-replay drift test that catches wire-shape changes earlier. |
| `system/task_notification` SDK type misses fields the wire emits (e.g., `tool_use_id`) | low | low | Existing drift test `tugcode/src/__tests__/wake-sdk-drift.test.ts` pins both compile-time (declared fields) and runtime (wire fields) coverage. |
| Concurrent wakes (Cohort A `task_notification` and Cohort B re-init arriving in close succession) double-bracket on the wire | low | low | Both handlers guard on `this.isInWake` and no-op if a bracket is already open. The reducer also flattens nested wakes at [D01]. |
| Resume-mode session (`--resume`) restores unexpired harness tasks that then fire — same detector applies but is unverified empirically | medium | low | Step 4 manual repro. The detector's heuristic is turn-state-based and doesn't care about session lifecycle, so it should hold. |

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [D01] Bracket pattern with a new `waking` phase {#d01-bracket-pattern}

**Decision:** A new reducer phase `waking` brackets the wake turn. Opened by `wake_started`, closed implicitly by the next `turn_complete` (no separate `wake_complete` frame).

**Rationale:** A wake turn needs a phase distinct from `idle` (so guards that drop assistant text in idle don't fire) and distinct from `submitting`/`streaming` (so submit/interrupt affordances aren't enabled mid-wake unless [Q03] says so). Closing implicitly on `turn_complete` reuses the existing turn-close path — no new wire frame, no new commit code.

Nested wakes flatten to one outer bracket. `handleWakeStarted` arriving while already `phase === "waking"` is treated as an idempotent metadata refresh.

#### [D02] tugcode is the detector, not the reducer {#d02-detector-location}

**Decision:** tugcode owns wake detection. The reducer only knows about the `wake_started` IPC frame.

**Rationale:** The wire shapes that signal a wake (`system/task_notification`, fresh `system/init`) are claude/SDK-specific. Keeping that knowledge in tugcode means the reducer is portable and the SDK's wire-shape evolution is absorbed at the tugcode boundary. The reducer's job is to react to a clean, semantic frame.

#### [D03] Guard loosening is additive {#d03-additive-guards}

**Decision:** Only one existing reducer guard needs to loosen for `waking`-phase events: `handleTextDelta`'s phase check now accepts `idle | streaming | waking` instead of `idle | streaming`. Every other guard remains a drop case; the wake bracket is the sole path that opens an inflight slot for waking.

**Rationale:** Minimum-change defensive policy. Each loosened guard is a new attack surface; one is auditable, more would not be.

#### [D04] Detection in tugcode, not the reducer {#d04-detection-location}

**Decision:** The detector lives in `tugcode/src/session.ts:handleClaudeLine`, which sees every parsed stream-json event regardless of `activeTurn` state.

**Rationale:** Cohort A `task_notification` arrives between turns (`activeTurn === null`); Cohort B re-init can arrive either between turns or mid-turn. The detector must classify correctly in both cases, which requires a single dispatch site that observes every event before turn-routing decides what to do with it.

#### [D05] Cohort B uses claude's harness scheduler — tugcode detects the re-init signal {#d05-reinit-detector}

**Decision:** Claude Code v2.1+ has its own scheduler that fires `ScheduleWakeup` / `CronCreate` timers between turns and emits a fresh `system/init` event to bracket the resulting assistant turn. tugcode does NOT run its own scheduler; it observes the fire signal and opens a wake bracket.

**Disambiguation:** `system/init` is also re-emitted mid-turn after `compact_boundary` events. Distinguish by `activeTurn` state at the time of arrival:

- `activeTurn === null` and `sessionInitSeen === true` → wake fire; emit `wake_started` and open `ActiveTurn`.
- `activeTurn !== null` and `sessionInitSeen === true` → mid-turn re-init (compact); fall through to `dispatchEventToTurn` so the existing `system_metadata` IPC forwarding behavior is preserved.
- `sessionInitSeen === false` → first init; flip the flag and fall through to normal dispatch.

The wake's user_message (the registered prompt) is injected into claude's internal queue and never appears on the stdout wire — tugcode sees only the assistant's response.

**Why no tugcode-side scheduler:** Empirically verified that the harness fires its own timers in stream-json spawn mode (see `roadmap/wake-investigation-findings.md`). Re-implementing the schedule logic would (a) duplicate work the harness already does, (b) double-fire if both timers run in parallel, and (c) require re-implementing the harness's cron rounding / jitter / DST handling.

#### [D06] Transcript treats wakes as single-row entries {#d06-transcript-wake-single-row}

**Decision:** `TideTranscriptDataSource` detects wake-style `TurnEntry`s (`userMessage.text === ""` and no attachments) and emits ONE row per such turn (the code-row only), not two. The per-turn index math uses an offset-table lookup; the renderer is unchanged.

**Rationale:** Wake turns carry no user-typed text — the empty-text marker is a contract sentinel, not user data. Rendering it as a "You" row produces a phantom user bubble.

The broader sequence-model rework — `TurnEntry` as paired `userMessage` + `assistant` is the wrong shape for the wire, which is a sequence of messages of varying kinds — is filed as a follow-on plan ([roadmap](#roadmap)).

---

### Specification {#specification}

#### Wire frames {#spec-wire-frames}

**`wake_started`** (tugcode → tugdeck IPC, ipc_version 2):

```ts
interface WakeStarted {
  type: "wake_started";
  session_id: string;
  wake_trigger: {
    task_id: string;          // empty for Cohort B (no tool id on the wire)
    tool_use_id: string;      // empty for Cohort B
    status: "completed" | "failed" | "stopped";
    summary: string;          // user-supplied reason for Cohort A; "scheduled wake" for Cohort B
    output_file: string;
  };
  ipc_version: 2;
}
```

No `wake_complete` frame. The bracket closes on the next `turn_complete`.

#### Reducer state {#spec-reducer-state}

`CodeSessionState` gains:

```ts
phase: ... | "waking";
wakeTrigger: WakeTrigger | null;  // camelCase, populated on wake_started, cleared on turn_complete
```

`CodeSessionSnapshot` mirrors the same.

#### Phase transitions {#spec-phase-transitions}

```
idle ───wake_started──→ waking ───turn_complete──→ idle (commits TurnEntry with empty userMessage)
                          │
                          └──interrupt──→ committing → idle (commits partial or cancels)
```

`submit` from `waking` enters the same merge-with-active-wake path as submit during streaming. The `Send` button is disabled during `waking`; `Stop` is enabled.

#### Guard loosening (only one needed) {#spec-guard-loosenings}

`handleTextDelta`'s phase guard: `if (state.phase !== "idle" && state.phase !== "streaming" && state.phase !== "waking") return ...`. Every other guard stays as drop case.

#### Transcript rendering {#spec-transcript}

For each committed turn:

- `userMessage.text === "" && userMessage.attachments.length === 0` → emit 1 row (`{ kind: "code" }`, key `${turnKey}-code`)
- Otherwise → emit 2 rows (`{ kind: "user" }` then `{ kind: "code" }`)

For the inflight slot: same rule, using `inflightUserMessage`.

---

### Compatibility / Migration / Rollout {#rollout}

No migration required. The change is additive:

- New IPC frame `wake_started` (consumers that don't know about it ignore it).
- New reducer phase `waking` (a value, not a schema change).
- New `wakeTrigger` snapshot field (nullable; legacy consumers see `null`).

Rollback is trivial: revert the commits. No persisted state shape changes.

---

#### New files {#new-files}

- `tugcode/src/__tests__/wake-reinit.test.ts` — re-init detector tests.
- `tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/probe-harness.mjs` — spawns claude directly, captures the raw stream-json wire.

- `tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/analyze.mjs` — decodes a capture for human reading.
- `tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/capture-{sw-60,cron-1m}-*.{stdout,jsonl,meta,stderr}` — committed capture artifacts.
- `roadmap/wake-investigation-findings.md` — empirical findings doc anchoring [D05].

#### Symbols added / modified {#symbols}

- `types.ts` gains `WakeStartedEvent`, `WakeTrigger`.
- `frameToEvent.ts` mints a `turnKey` for the wake bracket.

`tugdeck/src/lib/tide-transcript-data-source.ts`:

- Per-snapshot offset-table lookup replaces flat-index math.
- `isWakeTurn` / `isWakeInflight` helpers.
- `userRowIndexForTurn` returns `-1` for wake turns (consumers handle the sentinel).

---

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

Pure-logic only (no DOM). Three layers:

1. **Reducer**: each handler tested with hand-built `WakeStartedEvent` / `TurnCompleteEvent` against the state shape.
2. **tugcode dispatcher**: `handleClaudeLine` / `handleInterTurnEvent` / `handleWakeReInit` tested with parsed JSON event objects; assert state transitions and IPC emissions.
3. **Wire shape pinning**: drift tests load captured stream-json fixtures and assert the fields tugcode reads are present.

---

### Execution Steps {#execution-steps}

The implementation shipped across the following work; all steps are complete except Step 4.

#### Step 1: Slice 1 — Cohort A wake bracket {#step-1}

**Status:** Shipped.

**Scope:** `wake_started` IPC + reducer `waking` phase + `handleTaskNotification` detector for `system/task_notification`.

**Files:**
- `tugcode/src/session.ts`: `buildWakeStartedMessage`, `handleTaskNotification`, `WakeStarted` type.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/reducer.ts`: `handleWakeStarted`, `wakeTrigger` state, `waking` phase.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/frameToEvent.ts`: `turnKey` mint for the wake bracket.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/types.ts`: `WakeStartedEvent`, `WakeTrigger`.
- Drift test: `tugcode/src/__tests__/wake-sdk-drift.test.ts`.

**Manual repro:** Monitor / Bash runbg / Task runbg (idle wait) — wake turn paints.

#### Step 2: Slice 1b — Cohort B re-init detector {#step-2}

**Status:** Shipped (final fix in commit `bcc3e2b6`).

**Scope:** `handleWakeReInit` for the harness fire signal (`system/init` between turns).

**Files:**
- `tugcode/src/session.ts`: `sessionInitSeen` field, re-init detector branch in `handleClaudeLine`, `handleWakeReInit` method.
- `tugcode/src/__tests__/wake-reinit.test.ts` (6 cases).

**Manual repro:** ScheduleWakeup 60s / CronCreate one-shot / CronCreate recurring + CronDelete — all paint correctly (verified in sessions 95d18839, 017f1206, 5f5af4de; Monitor regression in 2cad794c).

#### Step 3: Slice 1c-a — transcript single-row for wake turns {#step-3}

**Status:** Shipped (commit `19c8cb58`).

**Scope:** `TideTranscriptDataSource` per-snapshot offset table; `isWakeTurn` / `isWakeInflight` helpers; `userRowIndexForTurn` returns `-1` for wake turns.

**Files:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/tide-transcript-data-source.ts`
- `tugdeck/src/lib/__tests__/tide-transcript-data-source.test.ts` (8 new wake-row cases).
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/tide-card-telemetry-popovers.tsx` (one consumer updated for `-1` sentinel).

**Manual repro:** wake fires without phantom "You" bubble.

#### Step 4: Robustness — wire-shape drift test + resume-mode verification {#step-4}

**Status:** Drift test shipped (10 cases). Resume-mode probe shipped; **empirical finding: scheduled wakes do not fire after resume in stream-json spawn mode** — an upstream Claude Code limitation, NOT a tugcode bug. Documented in `roadmap/wake-investigation-findings.md`.

**Artifacts:**

1. **Drift test for the Cohort B re-init pattern (SHIPPED).** `tugcode/src/__tests__/wake-reinit-drift.test.ts` loads `tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/capture-sw-60-*.stdout` and `capture-cron-1m-*.stdout` and asserts five invariants per capture:
   - exactly two `system/init` events (spawn + wake fire),
   - the first turn closes with `result/success` before the wake fires,
   - the second `system/init` is followed by the wake's `message_start`,
   - no `system/task_notification` precedes the wake (rules out Cohort A misclassification),
   - the wake turn closes with its own `result/success`.

   A future Claude Code release that changes any of these invariants fails the test loudly with a fixture-diff message instead of silently breaking Cohort B in production.

2. **Resume-mode probe (SHIPPED, finding documented).** `tugcode/probes/wake-investigation/probe-resume.mjs` spawns tugcode in new mode, schedules a ScheduleWakeup, kills tugcode, respawns in `--session-mode resume`, holds 150s past the scheduled fire time, and reports a PASS / FAIL verdict.

   **Empirical result: FAIL.** In `--input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --resume <id>` mode, claude restores the scheduled task's metadata (it can describe what's pending when asked) but the in-process scheduler does NOT actually fire restored tasks. No `system/init` re-emit, no synthetic user_message, no assistant turn — the wake simply never lands. The official scheduled-tasks docs claim `--resume` restores unexpired tasks; that does not appear to hold in our spawn configuration. Documented in detail in [`wake-investigation-findings.md`](./wake-investigation-findings.md).

   **Why this is not a tugcode bug:** the detector handles the fire signal correctly; the fire just doesn't arrive. If a future Claude Code release restarts the scheduler in this mode, the probe will PASS without tugcode code changes.

   **User-visible implication:** if a Tide session is closed before a scheduled wake fires and the user then reopens the session via the resume path, the wake will NOT fire. Sessions that stay open continuously are unaffected (Probes 1-4 confirmed live).

**Checkpoint:**
- `cd tugcode && bun x tsc --noEmit && bun test` green (463 tests).
- Resume-mode probe `bun probe-resume.mjs` runs end-to-end; current VERDICT line is `FAIL` for the reason above. If/when upstream changes, the same probe will surface a `PASS`.

---

### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- **Slice 1c-b — transcript sequence-model rework.** Replaces `TurnEntry`'s paired `userMessage` + `assistant` structure with a per-turn message sequence. Wakes are one instance of the paired-record mismatch; future cases include multiple consecutive assistant messages, system notes, and tool-only turns. Tracked separately; Slice 1c-a handles wakes specifically.
- **Slice 2 — trigger-aware chrome.** Render wake turns with a chip / banner showing what triggered them ("Monitor t-abc completed", "ScheduleWakeup fired at 7:30am"). Resolves [Q02]. The reducer already populates `wakeTrigger` for Cohort A; for Cohort B the chrome layer would need to snapshot the originating `ScheduleWakeup` / `CronCreate` tool_use payload and match it to the upcoming wake (the harness's re-init carries no tool id on the wire).
- **Slice 2 — replay-translator metadata persistence.** Cold-boot rehydration of historic wake turns paints them correctly via `replaying` phase, but the `wakeTrigger` metadata is lost. Slice 2 chrome that wants to render the trigger needs the translator to synthesize `wake_started` frames inline within the replay bracket. No `wake_complete` synthesis needed — the replayed `turn_complete` closes it.
- **Slice 2 — system-note rendering for the scheduled prompt.** Cohort B's wake prompt (registered with ScheduleWakeup / CronCreate) is injected into claude's internal queue and never appears on the stdout wire. To surface "wake fired with prompt: X" in the transcript, tugcode would need to remember the registered prompt at tool_use time. Requires Slice 1c-b's sequence model to land first.
- **Tide-side cancellation of scheduled tasks.** Today the user asks claude to call `CronDelete` to cancel a recurring fire. A direct UI affordance (right-click a scheduled task, "Cancel") would route a `CronDelete` request through tugdeck → tugcast → tugcode → claude. Out of scope until [Q02] chrome lands.
