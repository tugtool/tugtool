# Step 20.4.7.D — Spike findings (companion to tide-assistant-turns.md)

This document carries the findings for the six spikes (S1–S6) that gate [Step 20.4.7.D](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-7-d) — the cross-crate `/context`-style breakdown work. It is a companion to `tide-assistant-turns.md`; the parent step references each section here from its spike checklist.

**Headline outcome.** S2's verdict re-shapes the step: `/context` is not programmatically accessible through the Claude Agent SDK. There is no slash-command execution surface; the "send `/context` as a user message and scrape the synthetic assistant response" path is rejected for transcript-pollution reasons. **Local tokenization is therefore load-bearing, not optional**, and the rest of the spikes (S3 tokenizer choice, S4 update cadence, S5 settings access, S6 persistence shape) follow from that constraint.

## S1 — SDK surface inventory

**Plan reference:** [#step-20-4-7-d](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-7-d) Spike S1.
**SDK version inspected:** `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.2.42` (bundled `claudeCodeVersion: 2.1.42`).
**Scope:** every context-relevant surface the SDK exposes, MCP excluded by design.

### Question

Which SDK properties / methods / messages expose the data tugcode needs to build a `/context`-style per-category token breakdown? For each surface: what does it carry, is it read-once-at-init or queryable-per-turn, and is the *content* (tokenizable bytes) available or only an *identifier* (name)?

### Findings

#### The init message — `SDKSystemMessage { subtype: 'init' }`

Emitted once by the CLI when the SDK session comes up. Carries:

| Field | Shape | What it carries | Useful for tokenization? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude_code_version` | `string` | CLI version | No — metadata only |
| `model` | `string` | Selected model id | No directly — but lets us look up `contextWindow` |
| `cwd` | `string` | Working dir | No |
| `permissionMode` | `PermissionMode` | Permission policy | No |
| `apiKeySource` | `ApiKeySource` | Auth origin | No |
| `tools` | `string[]` | **Names** of enabled tools | Names only — schemas are not in the message |
| `agents` | `string[] \| undefined` | **Names** of custom agents | Names only — prompts are not in the message |
| `skills` | `string[]` | **Names** of available skills | Names only — manifests are not in the message |
| `slash_commands` | `string[]` | Names of slash commands | Names only |
| `plugins` | `{ name, path }[]` | Plugin name + on-disk path | Path lets us read content from disk |
| `mcp_servers` | `{ name, status }[]` | Per-server status | **Skipped** per "Out of scope: MCP" |
| `betas` | `string[]?` | Active betas | No |
| `output_style` | `string` | Output formatting | No |

Tugcode already projects most of these onto its own `SystemMetadata` IPC (see `tugcode/src/types.ts` `SystemMetadata` and `tugcode/src/session.ts:495–528` for the projection). It does NOT today read tool schemas, agent prompts, or skill manifests — only names propagate.

#### Per-turn result — `SDKResultMessage` (success + error)

Emitted at the end of each turn. Carries `usage: NonNullableUsage` (`BetaUsage` non-null) and `modelUsage: Record<string, ModelUsage>`. `ModelUsage` per model:

```typescript
{
  inputTokens: number;
  outputTokens: number;
  cacheReadInputTokens: number;
  cacheCreationInputTokens: number;
  webSearchRequests: number;
  costUSD: number;
  contextWindow: number;        // per-model context cap — useful
  maxOutputTokens: number;
}
```

Tugcode projects this as `cost_update` (`tugcode/src/session.ts:748`). The popover's 20.4.7.C view already reads it. The `inputTokens` figure here is wire-accurate Claude truth and is the load-bearing calibration signal for S3.

#### Per-turn methods on `Query`

The Query interface (`sdk.d.ts:996`) has these query / introspection methods:

| Method | Returns | Useful for context breakdown? |
|---|---|---|
| `initializationResult()` | `{ commands, output_style, available_output_styles, models, account }` | Same data as the init message, callable after the fact. No category content. |
| `supportedCommands()` | `SlashCommand[]` (name + description + argumentHint) | Enumerate only. No invocation surface — see S2. |
| `supportedModels()` | `ModelInfo[]` with `contextWindow: number` | **Useful** — gives us the per-model context cap independent of selected model. |
| `accountInfo()` | `AccountInfo` | No |
| `mcpServerStatus()` | `McpServerStatus[]` | Skipped — MCP excluded |
| `interrupt()`, `setModel()`, `setPermissionMode()`, etc. | mutation | N/A |

#### Compaction signals

`SDKCompactBoundaryMessage` (`sdk.d.ts:1216`):

```typescript
{
  type: 'system',
  subtype: 'compact_boundary',
  compact_metadata: { trigger: 'manual' | 'auto', pre_tokens: number },
  uuid, session_id
}
```

Plus `SDKStatus = 'compacting' | null` and a `PreCompactHookInput` hook. Tugcode already projects `compact_boundary` (`tugcode/src/types.ts:307`).

`pre_tokens` is the input-token count immediately before compaction. We can use this to (a) reset our running Messages token counter at compaction time and (b) calibrate our local tokenizer against Claude's truth opportunistically.

#### What the SDK does NOT expose

These are the structural gaps that shape the cross-crate implementation choices:

1. **No actual system-prompt content.** The CLI builds its own system prompt internally; the SDK only lets us supply an extra `systemPrompt` / `appendSystemPrompt` on `query()` options. Tugcode currently passes neither — meaning the system-prompt bytes the model sees are entirely internal to Claude Code and not addressable from the SDK.
2. **No tool schema payloads.** `init.tools` is `string[]` (names). Tool JSON-schemas live inside the CLI binary; the SDK does not surface them.
3. **No agent / skill / plugin content.** Names + (for plugins) paths only. Tugcode can read the on-disk content for any of these by walking `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.claude/skills/`, and plugin paths, but the SDK does not hand the content to us pre-resolved.
4. **No memory-file enumeration.** Memory files (`CLAUDE.md`, project `CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/memory/MEMORY.md` + linked files) are loaded by the CLI itself. Tugcode would need to mirror the CLI's discovery rules.
5. **No slash-command execution.** See S2.
6. **No per-category token breakdown event.** The thing we want does not exist on the wire. Either we synthesize it ourselves (current plan) or we wait for [anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript#66](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/issues/66) / [#507 on the python sibling](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/507) to ship.

### Decision

**Path B from the plan's "architectural decisions" — re-tokenize each component locally from SDK-exposed state plus disk reads tugcode performs itself.** Path A (slash-command scrape) is non-viable per S2; Path C (wait for upstream) is indefinite.

Implementation implication for tugcode:
- For category content, tugcode reads from disk the same files the CLI reads: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, project `CLAUDE.md` in `cwd`, the project's MEMORY.md if present, `~/.claude/agents/*.md` (for agent names that appeared in init), `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, plugin `agents/` and `skills/` subdirs.
- For the system-prompt bytes, **use a stable approximation** — tugcode does not have access to the actual CLI-internal prompt. Either (a) hardcode a "system prompt" token estimate calibrated against `usage.input_tokens` of the first turn (the calibration trick from S3 absorbs this), or (b) attribute all CLI-internal bytes to a single `system_prompt` bucket and accept that the exact split between "system prompt" and "system tools" is an estimate.
- The `contextWindow` cap comes from `modelUsage[model].contextWindow` after the first turn, or from `supportedModels()` at init.

### Follow-ups for the implementation tasks

- Tugcode needs a small "static-categories tokenizer" pass that runs at session_init and walks `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `cwd/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/skills/{names from init}/SKILL.md`, `~/.claude/agents/{names from init}.md`, plugin paths. Cache the per-file token counts keyed by `(path, mtime)` so re-runs (HMR, reload, resume) are free.
- Bundle the tool-schema token counts as a static table indexed by tool name + Claude Code version. The set of built-in tools is small (~15) and changes only with CLI upgrades. The static table is the simplest path to per-tool token counts without bundling the tool schemas in tugcode.
- The wire frame's `categories[].id` enum (`system_prompt | system_tools | custom_agents | memory_files | skills | messages | autocompact_buffer`) maps directly onto these disk-read groupings; `messages` is the only category that updates per turn and is sourced from `cost_update.usage.input_tokens` minus the static-category sum.

## S2 — Slash-command access from the Claude Agent SDK

**Plan reference:** [#step-20-4-7-d](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-7-d) Spike S2.
**SDK version inspected:** `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.2.42`.

### Question

Can the SDK execute `/context` (or any slash command) programmatically and capture its structured response? If yes, what's the surface and the response shape?

### Findings

#### Surfaces present in the SDK

| Surface | What it does | Executes a slash command? |
|---|---|---|
| `Query.supportedCommands()` (`sdk.d.ts:1050`) | Returns `SlashCommand[]` — `{ name, description, argumentHint }` | No — enumerate only |
| `Query.initializationResult()` (`sdk.d.ts:1044`) | Returns `{ commands, output_style, available_output_styles, models, account }` | No — same enumerate-only `commands` array |
| `SDKSystemMessage { subtype: 'init' }.slash_commands` | `string[]` (names) | No |
| `SDKControlRequestInner` union (`sdk.d.ts:1332`) | All control-request subtypes: `interrupt`, `can_use_tool`, `initialize`, `set_permission_mode`, `set_model`, `set_max_thinking_tokens`, `mcp_*`, `hook_callback`, `rewind_files`, `stop_task` | **No `execute_slash_command` subtype** |
| Sending `prompt: "/context"` via `query()` | Sends as a user message to the LLM | **Not the same thing** — the model would receive `/context` as text, not Claude Code's local handler |

#### What I checked and what I did not find

- No `Query.invokeCommand(name, args)` method, no `Query.runSlashCommand`, no equivalent.
- No control-request subtype that names a slash command to invoke.
- No SDK message type that carries a structured slash-command response. (No `SDKSlashCommandResultMessage` or similar.)
- The `SDKSystemMessage { subtype: 'init' }.slash_commands` array is `string[]` — not `{ name, handler }`. Confirms commands are CLI-side, not addressable.

#### The "synthetic assistant message" near-miss

In `tugcode/src/session.ts:554–587` the code handles built-in slash commands like `/cost` and `/compact` by detecting `message.model === "<synthetic>"` and emitting their assistant-text content directly. This means **some** slash commands surface their output through the message stream as synthetic assistant text. If `/context` did the same, sending it as a user-message would produce a parseable synthetic response.

But:
1. We have no way to confirm `/context` produces a synthetic message without running it end-to-end against a live Claude Code instance — and even then the output is human-formatted terminal text (table with ANSI colors), not structured JSON. Parsing it would be brittle to formatting changes.
2. Sending `/context` as a user-message would pollute the session transcript with a `/context` user turn the user did not type. This is observable: it would show up in `--continue`, `--resume`, and the JSONL replay. Unacceptable.
3. Even if we could fire-and-forget invisibly, the output is a terminal-shaped table; we would be scraping a UI surface rather than reading a data surface.

### Decision

**Slash-command execution is not viable as a data path.** `/context` cannot be programmatically invoked through the SDK with a structured response. Even the "send as user message" scrape path is rejected for transcript-pollution and parser-brittleness reasons.

This makes **local tokenization (Path B from architectural decision 1)** the only viable approach. See S3 for the tokenizer choice and the per-session calibration trick that pins our totals to Claude's observed `usage.input_tokens` truth.

### Follow-ups

- Watch [anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript#66](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-typescript/issues/66) and [claude-agent-sdk-python#507](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-agent-sdk-python/issues/507). If either ships a structured `/context` accessor, this step can swap implementations behind the existing wire frame without changing the renderer.
- If a future SDK adds a `Query.runSlashCommand()` that returns structured JSON, the `categories[]` projection becomes a direct map rather than a tokenized reconstruction, and the calibration trick from S3 becomes optional rather than load-bearing.

## S3 — Tokenization strategy

**Plan reference:** [#step-20-4-7-d](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-7-d) Spike S3.
**Accuracy bar:** within 5–10% of `/context` per-category totals — see the plan's "Accuracy bar" section.

### Question

Which tokenizer gets us inside the 5–10% accuracy bar at the lowest implementation + runtime cost? The plan prefers (b) a local approximation over (a) Anthropic's `count_tokens` API; this spike picks the specific tokenizer and lands the design that keeps drift inside the bar.

### Candidates

| Option | Local? | Accuracy for Claude 4.x | Cost | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| (a) Anthropic `count_tokens` HTTP API | No | Exact | ~460-token preamble per call, network latency | Reject — over-precise for our bar, expensive at our cadence |
| (b1) `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` npm package | Yes | "Rough approximation" per Anthropic (last accurate for Claude 2) | Free, sync, BPE-based | **Choose** — with the calibration trick below |
| (b2) `tiktoken` / `gpt-tokenizer` (OpenAI tokenizers) | Yes | ~10–30% drift on Claude | Free, sync | Reject — OpenAI BPE; wrong vocab |
| (b3) Character heuristic (`len/3.5`) | Yes | 20–40% drift on code-heavy content | Free, trivial | Reject — outside the bar |
| (b4) `@tokenlens/tokenizer` or other third-party Claude-aware packages | Yes | Varies | Free | Worth tracking but unproven; not the first cut |

### Findings on `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer`

- Published as `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` on npm by Anthropic.
- Anthropic's own docs state: *"This package can be used to count tokens for Anthropic's older models. As of the Claude 3 models, this algorithm is no longer accurate, but can be used as a very rough approximation."* ([Token counting docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/token-counting))
- The package itself is small, runs offline, and exposes `countTokens(text: string): number`.
- "Very rough" is unquantified. Without an empirical benchmark, we have to assume worst-case 15–25% drift on certain inputs (the bias is likely toward over-estimating tokens on dense code, since the Claude 2 vocab merges fewer code-style ngrams than current models).

### The calibration trick — why "very rough" still fits the 5–10% bar

The popover's display total is the sum of all per-category token counts. We have two anchors:

1. **Local tokenization gives per-category proportions** — relative sizes are stable across tokenizer choice because tokenizer drift is largely *content-shape-uniform* (a tokenizer that over-counts code by 18% over-counts every code-heavy category by roughly the same percentage).
2. **`cost_update.usage.input_tokens` gives Claude's exact total** — wire-accurate, comes for free with every turn we already track.

Strategy: tokenize per-category locally, then **scale every category by a per-session calibration ratio** computed from observed truth.

#### Calibration algorithm

```
At session_init:
  static_total_estimate = tokenize(system_prompt)
                        + sum(tokenize(t) for t in tools)
                        + sum(tokenize(a) for a in custom_agents)
                        + sum(tokenize(m) for m in memory_files)
                        + sum(tokenize(s) for s in skills)
  // Emit a provisional context_breakdown with raw estimates;
  // calibration_ratio = 1.0 until first turn lands.

After first turn_complete:
  observed = cost_update.usage.input_tokens   // Claude's truth for turn 1's input
  estimated = static_total_estimate + tokenize(first_user_message)
  calibration_ratio = observed / estimated     // typically 0.85–1.15
  // Re-emit context_breakdown with categories[].tokens scaled by ratio.

After every subsequent turn_complete:
  // messages_tokens is observed directly:
  messages_tokens = cost_update.usage.input_tokens
                  - static_total_estimate * calibration_ratio
  // Static categories stay at their calibrated values.
  // Emit context_breakdown with updated messages tokens.
```

This pins our display **total** to Claude's truth (within 1 token of `input_tokens`) while letting our per-category proportions drift on the local tokenizer. Per-category drift stays well inside the 5–10% bar because:

- Bulk drift is absorbed by `calibration_ratio`.
- Residual per-category drift depends only on *between-category* tokenizer non-uniformity — which is small (BPE drift biases are mostly content-shape-uniform, and our categories all contain natural-language + code mixtures of similar shape).
- Memory files re-tokenized per turn (on mtime change) use the same ratio.

#### When calibration would fail

- Sessions with zero user-message text in turn 1 (e.g., resume scenarios where the first observed turn is mid-conversation). Mitigation: skip calibration until the first turn whose `cost_update` arrives in a fresh session; carry forward the prior session's ratio if available; fall back to `ratio = 1.0` for resumes (the displayed total is still pinned to observed `input_tokens` — only the per-category split drifts).
- Per-turn cache-read bias: `usage.input_tokens` in the SDK is the non-cached input; cached reads are `cache_read_input_tokens` separately. The breakdown is interested in *content size*, not *billing size*. We use the sum `input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens` as the calibration anchor, which more closely matches "what's in the context window."
- Compaction. After `compact_boundary`, the static categories don't change but `messages_tokens` resets to a value Claude internally chose. The first post-compact `cost_update` gives us that value via `usage.input_tokens` minus the calibrated static sum. No special handling beyond the normal post-turn re-emit.

### Decision

**`@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` + per-session calibration ratio.**

Dependency to add to `tugcode/package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@anthropic-ai/tokenizer": "^0.0.4"  // pin to current; recheck on cli upgrades
}
```

Implementation surface:
- New `tugcode/src/context-breakdown.ts` module that owns the static-categories tokenization (cached by `path:mtime`), the calibration ratio (per-session state), and the per-turn frame emission.
- Hooked into `session.ts` at session_init (initial emit) and at `cost_update` (recompute + emit).
- Hooked into `compact_boundary` (re-emit with reset messages count).

### Follow-ups

- Benchmark `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` against `count_tokens` on a representative session (one shipping commit's worth of conversation) and record the actual drift in this section as evidence that calibration keeps us inside the 5–10% bar in practice. This is gallery-vettable: emit the raw + calibrated counts side-by-side in a dev-only debug mode.
- If `@tokenlens/tokenizer` (or any other claude-vocab tokenizer) ships a real Claude 4 BPE, swap behind the same module boundary without touching the wire frame or renderer.

### Drift benchmark appendix — measured 2026-05-18

Empirical validation per #step-20-4-7-d-0. Harness: `tugcode/scripts/benchmark-context-tokenizer.ts`. Ground truth: Anthropic `count_tokens` API against `claude-sonnet-4-5`. Samples: project `CLAUDE.md`, four tugplug agent definitions concatenated, two tugplug skill manifests concatenated, the user's `MEMORY.md` index, five memory entry files concatenated, plus three message-shaped samples (short user prompt, long code file, long natural-language excerpt).

Raw drift (local tokenizer vs. API), before any calibration:

| Category | Bytes | Local | API | Raw drift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `system_prompt_proxy` (project CLAUDE.md) | 2,746 | 751 | 755 | −0.53% |
| `custom_agents` (4 files) | 54,040 | 14,046 | 14,619 | −3.92% |
| `skills` (2 files) | 38,867 | 10,099 | 10,694 | −5.56% |
| `memory_files` (MEMORY.md) | 3,784 | 1,045 | 1,090 | −4.13% |
| `memory_files_entries` (5 files) | 3,573 | 1,000 | 1,040 | −3.85% |
| `messages_short` ("Run the tests…") | 37 | 9 | 16 | −43.75% |
| `messages_code` (TypeScript types.ts) | 13,644 | 3,747 | 4,272 | −12.29% |
| `messages_natural` (CLAUDE.md head) | 2,746 | 751 | 755 | −0.53% |

Static-category drift after calibration (anchor = `system_prompt_proxy`, `calibration_ratio = 1.0053`):

| Category | Local | Calibrated | API | Residual drift |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `custom_agents` | 14,046 | 14,121 | 14,619 | −3.41% |
| `skills` | 10,099 | 10,153 | 10,694 | −5.06% |
| `memory_files` | 1,045 | 1,051 | 1,090 | −3.58% |
| `memory_files_entries` | 1,000 | 1,005 | 1,040 | −3.37% |

**All four static categories land inside the 5–10% bar after calibration**, with worst case 5.06% (skills). The calibration ratio is essentially 1.0 against the natural-language anchor — the local tokenizer under-counts uniformly by ~4% on prose-shaped content, and one anchor's worth of calibration absorbs nearly all of it.

The two outliers (`messages_short` at −43.75%, `messages_code` at −12.29%) are real tokenizer limitations but **do not affect the design**, because the design does not locally tokenize message content. Per the calibration algorithm above:

```
messages_tokens = cost_update.usage.input_tokens − static_total_estimate * calibration_ratio
```

Messages tokens come from Claude's observed `usage.input_tokens` truth via subtraction; the local tokenizer never touches message bodies. The `messages_*` rows in the benchmark above were a stress-test of "what if we did locally tokenize messages" — and confirm we shouldn't. Subtraction is correct.

Notes on the outliers, for reference:
- `messages_short` (−43.75%): the API wraps each `messages: [{role, content}]` payload with ~7 tokens of role-envelope overhead. For a 9-token body that's a 43% relative drift; for a 1,000-token body it's <1%. This is a fixed-cost-per-message phenomenon — uniform across messages — and is absorbed by the calibration ratio over the session.
- `messages_code` (−12.29%): the Claude 2 BPE that `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` ships has fewer code-style merges than the current Claude 4 vocab. Code under-counts by ~12% even after calibration. Again, the design subtraction skips this entirely.

**Verdict:** the S3 calibration design is validated. Proceed with `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` + per-session calibration ratio for the static categories; derive `messages` by subtraction from observed `usage.input_tokens`. No tokenizer replacement needed for the current 5–10% bar.

Follow-up benchmarks worth running once 20.4.7.D.5 lands a live popover:
- Real-world session calibration: capture an actual `cost_update.usage.input_tokens` for the first turn of a fresh tugcode session and compute the live `calibration_ratio` from real data (vs. the proxy anchor used here).
- Long-running drift: track per-category residual across 50+ turns to verify the ratio is stable (it should be — it depends only on tokenizer-vs-vocab differences, which don't shift mid-session).

## S4 — Update frequency & caching design

**Plan reference:** [#step-20-4-7-d](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-7-d) Spike S4.
**Depends on:** S1 (SDK surface), S3 (tokenizer choice).

### Question

How often does the breakdown need to update? Which categories are session-stable vs. per-turn-mutable? Is there any mid-session path that breaks the "fixed categories are fixed" assumption?

### Findings

#### Category mutation classes

| Category | Mutation cadence | How tugcode detects | Re-tokenize policy |
|---|---|---|---|
| `system_prompt` | Once per session (CLI-internal; tied to `claude_code_version`) | Read from a static-table keyed by version | Cache by `version`; recompute only on CLI upgrade mid-session (rare) |
| `system_tools` | Once per session (set in `init.tools`) | `init.tools` names → static-table lookup by name + version | Cache by `(version, sorted tool names)` |
| `custom_agents` | Once per session (set in `init.agents`) | Read `~/.claude/agents/<name>.md` for each name | Cache by `(path, mtime)`; re-read only if `mtime` changes |
| `skills` | Once per session (set in `init.skills`) | Read `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for each name | Cache by `(path, mtime)` |
| `memory_files` | **Re-read each turn** by the CLI; rarely mutates | Re-tokenize iff `mtime` of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `cwd/CLAUDE.md`, project MEMORY.md (and linked files) changes | Cache by `(path, mtime)` |
| `messages` | **Per turn** (monotonic growth, with compaction resets) | Observe `cost_update.usage.input_tokens` after each `turn_complete` | Re-derive each turn (no caching needed — it's a single subtraction) |
| `autocompact_buffer` | Once per session (depends on user setting + a CLI-internal constant) | Read `~/.claude/settings.json` `autoCompactEnabled` at init — see S5 | Recompute only on settings change (not currently detected mid-session) |

#### Mid-session mutation paths that need handling

1. **CLI upgrade mid-session.** Theoretically possible if the user reinstalls Claude Code while a session is open. The static-categories cache key includes `claude_code_version`; on cache miss the static categories re-tokenize. In practice this requires the session to survive a CLI binary swap, which it usually doesn't.
2. **Memory-file mtime change.** The user edits `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or project `CLAUDE.md` between turns. Caught by `mtime` check before re-tokenizing. Re-emit `context_breakdown` if the new tokenization differs.
3. **`/compact` (manual or auto).** `SDKCompactBoundaryMessage` arrives with `compact_metadata.pre_tokens`. Tugcode treats this as a "messages count just reset" signal — re-emit `context_breakdown` after the next `cost_update`. The static categories are unchanged.
4. **Settings change mid-session.** The user toggles `autoCompactEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json` between turns. Not currently detected by tugcode. Acceptable — the user would need to restart Claude Code anyway for the autocompact setting to take effect; the breakdown's display will agree with whatever Claude Code is *currently* doing once the session is restarted.
5. **`/clear` or session reset.** Tugcode treats this as a new session — re-emit from scratch.

#### Emission cadence

Following from the mutation classes:

| Event | Action |
|---|---|
| `init` (SDK system message) | Tokenize all static categories with cache; emit provisional `context_breakdown` with `calibration_ratio = 1.0` |
| First `cost_update` after `init` | Calibrate per S3; re-emit `context_breakdown` |
| Each subsequent `cost_update` | Recompute `messages_tokens` from `usage.input_tokens` − calibrated static sum; re-emit |
| `compact_boundary` | Note the boundary; next `cost_update` will carry the new low-water-mark `usage.input_tokens` — re-emit then |
| Memory-file mtime change detected pre-turn | Re-tokenize that file; re-emit if the new sum differs from the cached |
| Each `turn_complete` | The `cost_update` precedes it — no separate work, the breakdown is already current |

#### Why per-turn re-emit is cheap

Re-emitting `context_breakdown` per turn is a fixed-size operation:
- Static categories: cache hit (no work).
- Memory files: `mtime` stat is sub-millisecond per file; ~3 files max.
- Messages: arithmetic.
- Frame serialization: a JSON object with ~7 entries — single-digit microseconds.

The cost is dominated by the cache miss path, which only runs at session init or on mtime change. Both paths tokenize a handful of files of total bytes ≤ tens of KB — `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` BPE tokenization runs in microseconds per KB. Worst case at session init: tens of milliseconds. Per turn: microseconds.

### Decision

- **Emit cadence:** init, first cost_update (calibration), every cost_update thereafter, after compact_boundary.
- **Cache keys:** `(path, mtime)` for file-backed categories; `(version, sorted names)` for the static-table tool/system-prompt counts.
- **Mutation handling:** re-stat memory files each turn; static categories cached for the session lifetime.
- **No mid-turn emit needed** — categories don't mutate within a turn.

### Follow-ups

- The cache lives on the tugcode process; HMR / supervisor restart loses it. The S6 persistence layer carries only the last emitted frame, not the cache. Cache misses on a fresh tugcode are cheap (tens of ms at init) so this is fine — no need to persist the cache itself.
- If `inotify`-style file watchers are added later (out of scope here), memory-file mtime changes could trigger mid-turn re-emits. Current design polls on the per-turn boundary, which is sufficient for the popover's responsiveness expectations.

## S5 — Autocompact buffer settings access

**Plan reference:** [#step-20-4-7-d](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-7-d) Spike S5.
**SDK version inspected:** `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk@0.2.42` (bundled `claudeCodeVersion: 2.1.42`).

### Question

How does tugcode learn:
1. Whether the user has autocompact enabled?
2. The current reserved-buffer size (token count) when enabled?

Two candidate paths from the plan: an SDK query, or a direct read of Claude Code's per-user config file.

### Findings

#### Path 1 — SDK exposes autocompact setting?

Searched `sdk.d.ts` exhaustively for `autoCompact`, `autocompact`, `compact.*setting`, `compact.*buffer`, `reserved.*token`, `buffer.*token`. Found:

- `SDKStatus = 'compacting' | null` — runtime status, not a setting.
- `SDKCompactBoundaryMessage` — fires after the fact, carries `pre_tokens` only.
- `PreCompactHookInput` — hook fires before compaction, carries no buffer size.

**No SDK surface exposes the user's autocompact setting or the reserved-buffer size.**

#### Path 2 — Direct read of `~/.claude/settings.json`

Confirmed by inspecting the running user's settings:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "enabledPlugins": {},
  "alwaysThinkingEnabled": true,
  "effortLevel": "xhigh",
  "autoUpdatesChannel": "latest",
  "theme": "dark-ansi",
  "autoCompactEnabled": false,   // <-- the field we need
  "skipAutoPermissionPrompt": true,
  "env": { "ENABLE_CLAUDEAI_MCP_SERVERS": "false" },
  "feedbackSurveyState": { ... }
}
```

The `autoCompactEnabled` boolean is a stable, top-level key. Schema is documented (Claude Code respects standard config locations: `~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/.claude/settings.local.json`, project-level `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/settings.local.json`).

**Confirmed: tugcode can read `~/.claude/settings.json` at session init and learn `autoCompactEnabled` reliably.**

#### Reserved-buffer size

No source in `~/.claude/settings.json` carries the reserved-buffer size — it's an internal Claude Code constant. Per the plan's research, current value is ~33k tokens (reduced from ~45k in early 2026). This is hardcoded in the CLI binary.

Options:
- **Hardcode the constant in tugcode** — `AUTOCOMPACT_BUFFER_TOKENS = 33000`. Track the CLI version it was measured against. Worst-case staleness: the popover shows a slightly-wrong buffer slice until tugcode is updated.
- **Derive empirically from `compact_boundary.compact_metadata.pre_tokens`** — when auto compaction fires, `pre_tokens` ≈ `context_max − buffer`, so `buffer ≈ context_max − pre_tokens`. Requires waiting for the first auto-compact in a session to learn it; useless at session init.

The pragmatic combo: **hardcode + observe**. Start with `AUTOCOMPACT_BUFFER_TOKENS = 33000`; if `compact_boundary` arrives with a `pre_tokens` value that implies a different buffer size, update the in-memory constant for the rest of the session and re-emit `context_breakdown`. Persist the observed value to the S6 store keyed by `claude_code_version` so subsequent sessions start with the calibrated value.

### Decision

**Settings access:** tugcode reads `~/.claude/settings.json` at session init via `fs/promises.readFile` + `JSON.parse`. Cache the parsed result; re-read on next session init. Look up `autoCompactEnabled: boolean` (default to `true` if missing — that matches Claude Code's documented default behavior).

**Reserved buffer:** start with hardcoded `AUTOCOMPACT_BUFFER_TOKENS = 33000` (current per claudefa.st guide; will need bumping as Claude Code evolves). On every `compact_boundary` event, infer the buffer from `pre_tokens` and update the constant for the rest of the session. Optionally persist the inferred value back to the S6 store keyed by `claude_code_version`.

**Wire frame behavior:** `categories[]` includes `autocompact_buffer` only when `autoCompactEnabled === true` AND the reserved count is non-zero. When disabled, the category is absent from the wire frame entirely; the renderer paints one fewer slice and a larger `free_space`.

### Implementation surface in tugcode

```typescript
// New: tugcode/src/claude-code-settings.ts
export interface ClaudeCodeSettings {
  autoCompactEnabled: boolean;
  // ... other fields tugcode may read in the future
}

export async function readClaudeCodeSettings(): Promise<ClaudeCodeSettings> {
  const path = `${os.homedir()}/.claude/settings.json`;
  try {
    const raw = await fs.readFile(path, "utf-8");
    const parsed = JSON.parse(raw) as Record<string, unknown>;
    return {
      autoCompactEnabled: typeof parsed.autoCompactEnabled === "boolean"
        ? parsed.autoCompactEnabled
        : true,  // CLI default
    };
  } catch {
    return { autoCompactEnabled: true };  // safe default
  }
}

// New constant:
export const AUTOCOMPACT_BUFFER_TOKENS_DEFAULT = 33_000;
```

The context-breakdown emitter reads settings once at session init and treats the value as immutable for the session.

### Follow-ups

- Mid-session settings change is not detected. If a future Tide UX surfaces an "autocompact buffer" toggle that writes to `~/.claude/settings.json`, tugcode would need a settings reload trigger. Out of scope here.
- If Claude Code ever exposes the reserved-buffer size through the SDK (e.g., via `initializationResult()` or a new `ConfigInfo` surface), switch to that and retire the hardcoded constant.
- Project-level `.claude/settings.json` could override the user-level setting. Current implementation reads the user-level file only. Document this as a known gap; address if it matters in practice. The `cwd` from `init` would be the discovery root for the project-level override.

## S6 — Persistence shape for `context_breakdown` frames

**Plan reference:** [#step-20-4-7-d](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-7-d) Spike S6.
**Depends on:** S1 (wire-frame shape), S5 (autocompact handling).

### Question

Where does the latest `context_breakdown` frame land in the sqlite session ledger? Three candidates from the plan:
- (a) Extension to the [#step-20-4-8](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-8) `session_state_changes` ledger.
- (b) New `context_breakdown_latest` single-row-per-session table (UPSERT semantics).
- (c) New `context_breakdown_history` append-only table.

The chosen shape must NOT carry any MCP-related field per the plan's "Out of scope: MCP" section.

### Analysis

#### Access pattern

The popover only ever wants the **latest** breakdown for the current session. At session bind, the supervisor inlines the latest breakdown onto the bind response so the snapshot's `lastContextBreakdown` populates before the popover opens. There is no consumer today for the full history.

#### Volume

If we emit on init + every turn_complete + every compact_boundary, a busy session might accumulate 50–200 breakdowns per session. Across a corpus of active sessions, this is small (single-digit MB per year), but it's also un-needed weight for a feature whose access pattern is "latest only."

#### 20.4.8's ledger is wrong-shaped

`session_state_changes` is a transition log for the indicator's tone axes (`phase`, `transportState`, `interruptInFlight`). It explicitly avoids fields outside that triple per the plan's "ledger axes ≡ indicator's tone axes" invariant. Cramming `context_breakdown` into it would break that invariant and confuse the table's purpose. Reject (a).

#### History table is premature

(c) appends every frame. The hypothetical future "context-growth over time" surface would benefit — but it's hypothetical. We can always derive coarse history from the existing `cost_update` rows + cached static-category counts; the static categories don't change within a session, so historical messages-tokens reconstructs to ±5% accuracy from the per-turn `usage.input_tokens` series alone. Adding (c) now would persist data we don't read. Reject (c).

#### Latest-only is right-sized

(b) `context_breakdown_latest` UPSERTs one row per session. The popover reads it once at bind. Storage stays bounded. When a future "context-growth over time" surface arrives, it can either (i) derive from `cost_update` series + cached statics, or (ii) add `context_breakdown_history` as a separate table without migrating `_latest`. Pick (b).

### Decision

**New table: `context_breakdown_latest`. One row per session. UPSERT on each `context_breakdown` frame. Payload stored as a JSON blob mirroring the wire frame verbatim.**

#### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS context_breakdown_latest (
  session_id  TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  payload     BLOB NOT NULL,
  captured_at INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

Plus a paired `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS context_breakdown_latest_cascade_delete_on_session AFTER DELETE ON sessions` mirroring the cascade triggers used by `turn_telemetry` and `session_metadata` in the same file. No FK constraint — the cascade trigger preserves the "forget cascades" contract without coupling INSERT ordering.

Notes on schema choices:
- **JSON blob, not per-column.** The single access pattern is PK lookup; the renderer reads a fixed-shape struct from the parsed JSON; the wire-frame TypeScript types validate the payload on both ends. Per-column storage would duplicate that validation without buying indexed-field queries we don't need. Promoting a new category in the future becomes a TypeScript-only change. This decision mirrors the `session_metadata` precedent in the same `session_ledger.rs` file, whose existing comment justifies the blob approach in nearly identical terms.
- **No `mcp_tools` category in the wire frame**, so no MCP bytes ever reach this table. Per "Out of scope: MCP" in the plan.
- **`session_id` column name** matches the convention used by `turn_telemetry` / `session_metadata` in the same file (the column is the Claude-assigned session id, which IS the Tug-tracked session at this layer).
- **`captured_at`** is the wall-clock millisecond timestamp when the row was last written — for debugging / staleness audits. Distinct from any time field the payload itself may carry.

Tradeoff intentionally accepted: no `WHERE messages_tokens > X` style queries. If a future "context-growth over time" surface needs them, it lives in a separate `context_breakdown_history` table that can parse the blob into per-category columns at insert time, leaving `_latest` as the popover's source of truth.

Per-session axes the payload itself carries (in the wire frame JSON), not as separate columns:
- `context_max` — the model's context-window cap.
- `categories[]` — per-category id + label + token count. Wire frame's array shape is what the renderer wants; no normalization needed at the persistence layer.
- `autocompact_buffer` — present in `categories[]` only when the user has the buffer enabled (per S5); absent otherwise. Renderer trusts the wire-frame shape.
- `calibration_ratio` — the per-session scaling from S3, carried in the wire frame so a resume can re-emit calibrated frames before the first new turn lands.
- `claude_code_version` — the cache-key axis from S4; a CLI upgrade rewrites the row with re-tokenized values.

#### Writer / reader paths

- **Persistence lives in the tugcast `SessionLedger`** (`tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/session_ledger.rs`), the same sqlite store that already owns `sessions`, `turns`, `turn_telemetry`, and `session_metadata`. *Not* the separate `tugbank-core` typed-defaults store — that one is reserved for user-preferences-style key-value defaults, while `SessionLedger` is the per-session metadata store the supervisor already owns and cascade-deletes on `forget`. (Earlier drafts of this section called it "tugbank"; that was wrong.)
- **Writer:** symmetric with the `record_turn_telemetry` precedent from `#step-20-3-4`. tugcode emits the `context_breakdown` frame; the supervisor forwards it to tugdeck unchanged; tugdeck's reducer consumes it and dispatches a `record_context_breakdown` CONTROL action back to the supervisor; the supervisor calls `SessionLedger.record_context_breakdown(&row)`. Reducer-as-persistence-boundary keeps the supervisor agnostic of the wire shape and matches the existing pattern.
- **Reader:** at session bind, the supervisor SELECTs the row by `session_id` (matching the `session_id` column convention used by `turn_telemetry` / `session_metadata`) and inlines it onto the bind response. The reducer's bind handler projects it onto `CodeSessionSnapshot.lastContextBreakdown`. If no row exists, `lastContextBreakdown === null` and the popover hits its 20.4.7.C fallback per the plan's "Fallback contract".

#### Transport-close behavior

The plan asks whether transport-close should clear the latest breakdown or preserve it across reconnect. Decision: **preserve it.** The breakdown describes session-level facts (system prompt size, memory file contents, accumulated messages) that survive a transport flap. Clearing on transport-close would briefly degrade the popover to its fallback view during a reconnect, which is jarring and wrong. Keep the row; let the next live `context_breakdown` frame overwrite it on the next turn.

#### 20.4.8 MCP-column audit

When [#step-20-4-8](tide-assistant-turns.md#step-20-4-8) lands, audit its `session_state_changes` schema for any MCP-related column or row variant. If found, delete it as part of this step's persistence work. Current 20.4.8 schema (per the roadmap as of 2026-05-18) has no MCP columns — the schema is exactly `(id, tug_session_id, at_ms, phase, transport_state, interrupt_in_flight)`. Confirmed clean — no MCP cleanup needed if 20.4.8 lands as currently designed.

### Decision summary

- **Shape:** `context_breakdown_latest` table, one row per session, UPSERT semantics.
- **Persistence cadence:** every emitted frame (init + per-turn + post-compact).
- **No MCP columns.**
- **Transport-close:** preserve the row.
- **Bind reader:** supervisor inlines the row onto the bind response.

### Follow-ups

- If a future "context-growth over time" surface lands, add a separate `context_breakdown_history` append-only table at that point. The two tables can coexist; `_latest` stays the popover's source of truth.
- The `calibration_ratio` column is currently per-session. If we want cross-session calibration (e.g., "carry forward last session's ratio for a quick startup before the first new turn lands"), a separate `context_breakdown_calibration_history` table keyed by `(cwd, claude_code_version)` could store rolling averages. Out of scope for this step.
- 20.4.8 schema is currently MCP-clean; re-audit at implementation time and add a `DROP COLUMN` migration here if anything slipped in.
