# WebSocket Verification Report

**Date**: 2026-03-29
**Probe**: `tugtalk/probe-websocket.ts`
**Status**: PASS — end-to-end WebSocket path through tugcast is functional

---

## Overview

This document records the findings from running `tugtalk/probe-websocket.ts`, a probe that
launches tugcast as a subprocess, connects via WebSocket, sends a user message over the
CodeInput feed, and verifies that responses flow back from tugtalk.

---

## Wire Protocol

All WebSocket messages between tugcast and clients are **binary frames** (not text).

**Frame format:**
```
[1 byte: FeedId] [4 bytes: payload length, big-endian u32] [N bytes: payload]
```

**Feed IDs observed:**

| FeedId | Name             | Direction        | Payload     |
|--------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 0x00   | TerminalOutput   | server → client  | raw bytes   |
| 0x10   | Filesystem       | server → client  | JSON        |
| 0x20   | Git              | server → client  | JSON        |
| 0x30   | Stats            | server → client  | JSON        |
| 0x31   | StatsProcessInfo | server → client  | JSON        |
| 0x32   | StatsTokenUsage  | server → client  | JSON        |
| 0x33   | StatsBuildStatus | server → client  | JSON        |
| 0x40   | CodeOutput       | server → client  | JSON-line   |
| 0x41   | CodeInput        | client → server  | JSON-line   |
| 0xFF   | Heartbeat        | bidirectional    | empty       |

## Event Sequence Observed

On the first WebSocket connection:

1. **Snapshot feeds delivered immediately** (within <1ms of WebSocket open):
   - `0x20` Git snapshot
   - `0x30` Stats (aggregate)
   - `0x31` StatsProcessInfo
   - `0x32` StatsTokenUsage (0 bytes — empty initially)
   - `0x33` StatsBuildStatus
   - `0x40` `project_info` (CodeOutput) — project dir from tugtalk
   - These are sent **twice** on first connect (see note on double-delivery below)

2. **Filesystem snapshot** (0x10) appears ~60ms after connect

3. **Stats updates** (0x30) arrive every 1 second

4. **Terminal output** (0x00) appears intermittently when tmux session has activity

5. **`session_init`** (CodeOutput, 0x40): **NOT received** due to race condition (see below)

After sending a `user_message` via CodeInput (0x41):

6. `cost_update` arrives immediately (with $0.0000, 0 turns)
7. `turn_complete` with `result=error` arrives immediately (no `assistant_text` deltas seen)

---

## Key Findings

### 1. WebSocket transport is fully functional

The probe successfully:
- Launched tugcast with `--no-auth`
- Connected via WebSocket
- Received binary frames from all active feeds
- Sent a CodeInput frame to tugcast
- Received a CodeOutput response (turn_complete)
- Disconnected and reconnected, receiving fresh snapshot frames

The binary framing layer, feed routing, and bidirectional communication all work correctly.

### 2. `session_init` race condition (significant gap)

**Problem**: `session_init` is delivered over the `code_tx` broadcast channel, which is a
fire-and-forget broadcast. There is NO replay mechanism. If a WebSocket client connects after
`session_init` is broadcast, it never sees that event.

**Observed timing** (from probe logs, multiple runs):

Run 1 (fast startup, tmux session exists):
- Tugtalk starts and emits `session_init` at ~30ms after launch
- TCP port binds at ~100ms after launch
- `session_init` was broadcast ~70ms BEFORE the TCP port even opened
- Result: `session_init` MISSED

Run 2 (slow startup, tmux session created fresh):
- Port bound at ~310ms after launch
- Tugtalk started at ~320ms (after port bind this time)
- `session_init` received successfully at 320ms

The race window is non-deterministic. When a tmux session already exists, tugcast
starts the TCP listener AFTER tugtalk is already running (since tugtalk spawning is
async), and `session_init` arrives before the port is ready. When a new tmux session
must be created, startup is slower and the race is less likely.

**Impact on UI**: The tugdeck frontend connects via WebView which takes hundreds of
milliseconds to load and execute JS. It will reliably miss `session_init` on every fresh
launch. This means the UI never receives the session ID or initial session state via the
WebSocket.

**Note**: `project_info` (which wraps the project directory) IS delivered via the watch
channel (`code_watch_tx`) and therefore always arrives as a snapshot on connect. But
`session_init` is NOT on the watch channel — it only goes on the broadcast.

**Current mitigation**: Unknown. The UI may be deriving session state from other sources
or not relying on `session_init` at startup.

### 3. `turn_complete result=error` on message send

When we sent `user_message` without having seen `session_init`, we received:
- `cost_update` ($0.00, 0 turns) — immediately
- `turn_complete` (result=error) — immediately (no streaming text)

This indicates one of:
- The session being resumed (05086f97) is corrupted or expired
- The tugtalk session in the worktree is associated with a different project context
- The probe is using a stale `.tugtool/.session` file from prior probe runs

The WebSocket delivery of both events was correct — the error is at the
tugtalk/claude layer, not the transport layer.

### 4. Double delivery of snapshot feeds on first connect

On the first WebSocket connection, snapshot feeds (Git, Stats, StatsProcessInfo,
StatsTokenUsage, StatsBuildStatus, CodeOutput/project_info) were delivered twice. This
appears to be a quirk of the watch channel snapshot mechanism (multiple watch receivers
being iterated). Not harmful but worth noting.

### 5. Reconnection behavior

After disconnecting and reconnecting:
- All snapshot feeds are immediately delivered (filesystem, git, stats, project_info)
- Heartbeat frames flow correctly
- No `session_init` is resent (expected — it was a one-shot broadcast)
- The WebSocket is ready for new `user_message` interactions immediately after connect

Session continuity (same session ID after reconnect) was **not verified** in this run
because we never received the first `session_init`. However, the architecture supports
this: tugtalk persists the session ID to `.tugtool/.session`, so after a reconnect the
same session should be available.

## Issues Discovered

| Priority | Issue | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| HIGH | `session_init` race condition | CodeOutput broadcast channel has no replay. Clients connecting after tugtalk's startup will never see `session_init`. The watch channel only includes `project_info`, not `session_init`. |
| MEDIUM | `result=error` on user_message | Probe's stale session resume causes immediate error. New-session flow (sending `session_command: new` first) was not tested. |
| LOW | Double snapshot delivery on first connect | Snapshot feeds sent twice on initial connection. Cosmetic but wastes bandwidth. |
| INFO | Tugcast tracing not visible via Bun pipe | When spawned with `stderr: "pipe"` by Bun, Rust tracing output is buffered/lost. Only tugtalk's direct `process.stderr.write` lines are visible. Port polling used instead. |

## Recommendations

### Before UI work

1. **Fix `session_init` delivery**: Put `session_init` on the watch channel
   (`code_watch_tx`) so new clients always receive the current session state as a
   snapshot. This is the same mechanism used for `project_info`.

2. **Verify new-session flow**: Update the probe to send `session_command: new` after
   connecting (or delete the `.tugtool/.session` file before launching), then wait for
   `session_init` and verify full turn with `assistant_text` streaming.

3. **Fix double snapshot delivery**: Investigate why watch channel snapshots are sent
   twice on first connect.

### Architecture notes for UI implementation

- The UI MUST NOT rely on receiving `session_init` from the WebSocket broadcast.
  Either fix the race (recommendation 1 above) or use an HTTP endpoint to fetch
  current session state.
- Sending `user_message` works immediately after WebSocket connect, even without
  seeing `session_init` — the message is routed to the active tugtalk session.
- All snapshot feeds (filesystem, git, stats) are delivered synchronously on connect.
  These can be trusted to be current immediately after `ws.onopen`.
- The `code_watch_tx` watch value (project_info) is always available on connect.
- Heartbeat frames (0xFF) are sent by tugcast every 15 seconds; clients should respond
  to keep the connection alive (see `connection.ts` in tugdeck for reference).

## Is the path ready for UI work?

**Partially.** The transport layer is solid — binary framing, feed routing, and
bidirectional communication all work. However, the `session_init` race condition is a
blocking issue for any UI component that depends on session state at startup. UI work
that doesn't require `session_init` (terminal display, filesystem feed, git feed,
stats display) can proceed. The conversation/code panel UI should wait for the
`session_init` fix first.
