# Markdown Attachments {#markdown-attachments}

**Purpose:** Give every markdown-editing surface durable, honest attachment handling: files dropped on a Text card become real files in a sibling `assets/` folder referenced by standard markdown links, and images dropped on the Session card's prompt entry survive an app relaunch as resubmittable attachments instead of vanishing.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

Two attachment problems today, both rooted in "the bytes have no durable home":

1. **Text cards can't attach anything.** The Text card (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/text-card.tsx` + `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-text-card-editor.tsx`) is a CM6 editor over a plain file on disk. Its editor deliberately excludes the composer's atom/drop machinery (see the `tug-text-card-editor.tsx` module docblock — atoms, completion, and drop are listed as "deliberately NOT here"), so dropping a file on it does nothing. There is no storage or linkage story for an attachment, and the documents must remain pure markdown — no `.rtfd`-style sidecar bundle, no proprietary link scheme.

2. **Prompt-entry attachments do not survive a relaunch.** A dropped/pasted image becomes a chip atom (`AtomSegment` with a UUID `id`) plus base64 bytes in a per-card in-memory `AtomBytesStore` (`tugdeck/src/lib/atom-bytes-store.ts`). No source path is ever captured. On save, `capDurableCardState()` (`tugdeck/src/settings-api.ts`) deliberately deletes `content.attachmentBytes` before the tugbank write — persisting megabytes of base64 through the defaults store once stalled boot at ~18 MB — and on restore `pruneOrphanedImageAtoms` (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-prompt-entry.tsx`) splices the now-payload-less chips out of the draft. Only the small baked thumbnail survives (via prompt history), and it is preview-only: `buildWirePayload` skips entries with empty `content`. This reads as user data loss.

A database-backed store with app-served links (Joplin's `:/resource-id`, Notion's signed URLs) was considered and **rejected**: it produces markdown that parses but is dead outside the app, and tugcast's per-instance port (allocated from the 55300–55399 window with walk-on-collision) makes any `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/…` link wrong on the next launch. The survey of prior art (Typora, Zettlr, Logseq, TextBundle, Obsidian-in-markdown-links-mode) converged on the pattern this plan adopts: copy bytes into a deterministic relative folder at drop time and write a standard markdown link. The durable in-repo template for the draft tier already exists: Gazette attachments are path-backed — `store_attachments` (`tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/operator.rs`) rests uploaded bytes under `tugcore::instance::data_dir().join("gazette-attachments")` (`tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/main.rs`, `OperatorContext.attachments_dir`), the post carries `{path, media_type}`, and the deck re-fetches through `GET /api/fs/blob` (`tugdeck/src/lib/gazette-attachment-bytes.ts`).

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **No database, no new server.** Attachments are files; tugcast (the only HTTP server in the suite, `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/server.rs::build_app`) grows two small upload routes and a GC sweep. [P01]
- **Two tiers, one vocabulary.** *Attach = the bytes get a durable home and the surface holds a reference.* For documents the home is next to the document (portable, user-owned, git-visible). For composer drafts the home is app-owned under the per-instance data dir (transient by nature, GC'd). [P02] [P06]
- **Rust first, then the deck.** Land and test the upload routes and storage helpers before touching tugdeck, so every frontend step verifies against a real endpoint.
- **Originals at rest, downsampling at time of use.** Stored bytes are always the verbatim original; the existing downsample pipeline runs when bytes are about to be shown to a model. [P04]
- **The Text card stays a raw-source editor.** No image widgets, no preview pane — the drop gesture writes bytes and inserts a link; syntax stays visible per the card's existing doctrine. ⌘-click opens a viewable asset in a viewer card. [P10]
- **Sequencing:** Tier 2 (composer durability) first — it is nearly mechanical given the Gazette template and pays off the "user data loss" pain immediately — then Tier 1 (Text card drops), then GC.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- Drop an image on the prompt entry, quit and relaunch Tug.app: the draft restores with the image chip in place — briefly a reserved slot, then its thumbnail once rehydration lands ([P07a]) — and submitting sends a real image block (verify via the transcript showing the image and the model describing it). App-test asserts the durable card state carries a `path` and an empty `content`.
- Recall a pre-relaunch prompt from history (↑): the image atom rehydrates to resubmittable bytes, not a preview-only tile.
- Drop `photo.png` on a Text card editing `roadmap/foo.md`: `roadmap/assets/photo.png` appears on disk byte-identical to the source, and `![photo](assets/photo.png)` is inserted at the drop caret. Drop the same filename again: `assets/photo-2.png` and a matching link.
- The written markdown renders the image on GitHub / any standard renderer (relative link, no Tug-specific syntax) — verify by `git diff` inspection of the link form.
- tugbank card-state writes stay small: the durable bag for a card with three dropped images carries three short path strings and no image data at all — no base64 `content`, no `thumbnailDataUrl` ([P07a]) — verified by a unit test on `capDurableCardState`.
- GC: a file in `draft-attachments/` whose UUID appears in no card-state draft and no prompt-history entry, with mtime older than the grace period, is removed at tugcast startup; a referenced or young file is not (Rust unit test).

#### Scope {#scope}

1. Tier 2: durable, resubmittable image attachments in the Session card prompt entry (drop + paste), across relaunch, including prompt-history recall.
2. Tier 1: file drops on the Text card — bytes copied to a sibling `assets/` folder, standard markdown link inserted; images and non-images alike.
3. Two tugcast upload routes plus a startup GC sweep for the draft tier.
4. ⌘-click on a relative asset link in the Text card opens the asset in a viewer card (viewable extensions only).

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Inline image rendering / preview panes in the Text card — it remains a raw-source editor.
- Attachments in Jots rows (`TugMessageEditor`) or any other `TugTextEditor` host beyond the Session card prompt entry — jots are reusable prompt fragments; a dropped image has no home there yet.
- Non-image attachments in the prompt entry — they continue to degrade to filename text ([P05]; see [Q01]).
- The Gazette composer — already path-backed; untouched.
- GC for Tier 1 `assets/` folders — user-owned files in user-owned (usually git-tracked) space; orphans are visible in `git status` and are the user's to manage (Risk R02).
- Cross-tool link rewriting on document rename/move (Obsidian-style) — the link is relative; moving the `.md` without its `assets/` folder breaks it, as in every tool using this pattern.

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- tugcast's existing fs route guards: `guard_absolute_path`, secret-denylist, loopback-only posture (`tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/fs_read.rs`, shared by `fs_write.rs` / `fs_blob.rs`).
- `GET /api/fs/blob` (`tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/fs_blob.rs`) — serves the stored bytes back; its extension→MIME table already covers png/jpeg/gif/webp/heic/heif/avif/tiff/bmp/ico/pdf.
- The existing downsample pipeline (`tugdeck/src/lib/image-downsample.ts` — `downsampleImage`, `MAX_LONG_EDGE_PX = 2576`, `MAX_BASE64_SIZE = 5 MB`, `THUMBNAIL_MAX_EDGE_PX = 512`).
- tugbank reachable from tugcast (already true: `TugbankClient` is passed into `build_app` for the `/api/defaults` routes; per [D15] tugbank unavailability is fatal at startup).

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- **Warnings are errors** (`-D warnings` via `tugrust/.cargo/config.toml`).
- **[L29] canonicalization gateway.** Every stored attachment path is both a persisted value and a compared value, so no raw path may be persisted or matched. Server-side, `guard_absolute_path` (`fs_read.rs`) already runs `resolve_to_claude_form` and is the gateway for the `doc` argument; the paths both routes *return* are built from gateway output (S01) or from `data_dir()` (S02) and are canonical by construction. The GC never compares paths at all — it matches on the UUID basename ([P08]), which is spelling-invariant.
- Documents stay pure markdown: links must be standard CommonMark, resolvable by non-Tug tools.
- No Web storage; all persistence through tugbank / files ([no-localStorage rule]).
- tugdeck laws apply: [L02] external state via stores, [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM, no React state for chip pending-appearance.
- App-tests run selectively via `just app-test-changed`; new tests carry `@covers` headers.
- Verify tugdeck changes with `bunx vite build` before declaring done (debug app loads the prod rollup bundle).

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The per-instance `data_dir()` is stable across relaunches of the same instance (it is: `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` keys it), so absolute paths recorded in durable card state remain valid. The question of a draft crossing instances does not arise: `tugbank.db` is itself per-instance (`instances/<id>/tugbank.db`, `tugbank/src/main.rs`), so card state and its attachments are always in the same instance dir and are removed together by `tugutil host instance prune`.
- Original dropped files are reachable as browser `File` blobs at drop time (they are — the drop pipeline already reads them for downsampling), so "upload the original" needs no filesystem source path.

### Open Questions {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Non-image drops on the prompt entry (DEFERRED) {#q01-composer-non-image}

**Question:** Should a `.zip`/`.md` dropped on the composer become a durable `file` atom carrying a stored path, instead of degrading to filename text?

**Why it matters:** It changes what submit means for non-images and touches the wire docblock's explicit "text-file inline attachments not supported" stance (`tugdeck/src/lib/build-wire-payload.ts` module docblock).

**Resolution:** DEFERRED — parity-with-today scope ([P05]) ships first; revisit once Tier 2 is in use.

#### [Q02] Attachment affordances for Jots and other TugTextEditor hosts (DEFERRED) {#q02-jots-surfaces}

**Question:** Do jot rows ever want image attachments?

**Resolution:** DEFERRED — jots are prompt fragments stored in `jots.json` (1 MiB doc cap); an attachment story there needs its own design. Nothing in this plan blocks it: `tugDropExtension`'s bytes-store parameter is already per-host.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| GC deletes a live draft attachment | high | low | Conservative sweep: UUID-basename match ([P08]) against both root sets (card state + prompt history) union'd, grace period on mtime, delete only inside `draft-attachments/` | Any user report of a chip losing its bytes |
| Tier 1 orphaned assets accumulate | low | med | None by design — user space, git-visible | User asks for a sweep tool |
| Large originals inflate uploads | med | low | Raw-bytes bodies (no base64/JSON inflation), explicit per-route body limits | Body-limit 413s in the wild |
| Durable path stops resolving (file moved/deleted externally) | med | low | Rehydrate failure degrades to today's behavior: chip with no bytes, pruned from wire | — |
| In-app **Save As** breaks a document's asset links | low | med | None in this phase — see [R03] | User hits it once |

**Risk R01: GC correctness** {#r01-gc-correctness}

- **Risk:** The sweep's root set misses a reference class and reclaims live bytes (Joplin's history is the cautionary tale).
- **Mitigation:** Only two producers ever write `draft-attachments/` references (durable card state, prompt history), both enumerable in the instance's own tugbank; the sweep unions both, applies a 7-day mtime grace, and touches only files directly inside `draft-attachments/`.
- **The comparison is on the UUID, not the path** ([P08]). An earlier draft of this plan matched the stored absolute path as a substring of the roots' JSON. That is exactly the failure [L29] exists to forbid: one directory has many spellings (`/u/src/…` vs `/Users/…`, firmlinks, the APFS data-volume link), two spellings silently fail to match, and here a failed match is not a dark row — it is **deletion of live user bytes**. Matching the `<uuid>` extracted from the filename removes the exposure by construction: a v4 UUID cannot collide, cannot be re-spelled, and appears in the roots' JSON if and only if some surface still references that file. There is no path comparison anywhere in the sweep.
- **Residual risk:** A future feature that stores these references elsewhere must add itself to the root set — noted in the sweep's docblock.

**Risk R02: Tier 1 orphans** {#r02-tier1-orphans}

- **Risk:** A user drops a file, then deletes the link (or never saves the doc); the asset file remains.
- **Mitigation:** Accepted. Assets land in user-visible, usually git-tracked space; `git status` shows them; deletion is a normal file operation.
- **Residual risk:** Clutter in long-lived `assets/` folders.

**Risk R03: Save As breaks asset links** {#r03-save-as}

- **Risk:** The Non-goals disclaim link rewriting on an *external* rename, which is standard for this pattern. But the Text card owns a **Save As** gesture of its own (`text-card-store.ts`, `saveAs`), and saving a document with asset links into another directory breaks every one of them — a Tug-initiated break, not a user's `mv`.
- **Mitigation:** None in this phase. `saveAs` is untouched and the links break exactly as a `mv` would.
- **Residual risk:** Accepted for now; the follow-on is either copying `assets/` alongside on `saveAs` or warning when the document being moved carries relative asset links. Listed under Roadmap.

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] No database; attachments are plain files served by tugcast (DECIDED) {#p01-files-not-db}

**Decision:** Attachment bytes live as ordinary files on disk. No new server, no SQLite blob store, no app-scheme or localhost-URL links.

**Rationale:**
- A DB-keyed link (`:/id`, `tug://`, `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/…`) is dead outside the app; the per-instance port window makes localhost URLs wrong across launches.
- `/api/fs/blob` already streams files with ETag/Range semantics; files need no schema migrations, no `ledger_db` gateway, no `db-inspect` discipline.

**Implications:** Both tiers reduce to "where does the file go and what string does the surface hold."

#### [P02] Tier 1 home: shared sibling `assets/` folder, standard relative links (DECIDED) {#p02-shared-assets}

**Decision:** A file dropped on a Text card editing `<dir>/<doc>.md` is written to `<dir>/assets/<name>`, and the editor inserts `![<stem>](assets/<name>)` for images, `[<name>](assets/<name>)` for everything else.

**Rationale:**
- The relative-folder + standard-link pattern is the only one where GitHub, pandoc, Obsidian, and `cat` all agree on what the document means (TextBundle/Typora/Zettlr/Logseq precedent).
- Shared `assets/` (not `<doc>.assets/`) suits repo docs like `roadmap/`: less clutter, and orphan lifecycle is visible in git anyway.

**Implications:** Moving a `.md` without its `assets/` folder breaks links — accepted, standard for the pattern (see Non-goals).

#### [P03] Filename policy: original name, `-2`/`-3`… collision suffix (DECIDED) {#p03-name-suffix}

**Decision:** Assets keep their original filename; a collision appends `-N` before the extension (`photo.png` → `photo-2.png`), resolved server-side at write time. The markdown link percent-encodes characters that would break a CommonMark destination (spaces, parens).

**Rationale:** These links are meant to be read; content-hash names would make the markdown opaque. Server-side resolution makes the write atomic with the name choice.

#### [P04] Originals at rest; downsample at time of use (DECIDED) {#p04-originals-at-rest}

**Decision:** Stored bytes are always the verbatim dropped file. The downsample pipeline (2576 px / 5 MB caps) runs only when bytes are headed to a model: at drop time for the in-memory store entry (as today), and at rehydrate time when restoring a draft from disk.

**Rationale:** The caps exist for API-payload reasons; baking them into storage destroys data. A draft that survives a relaunch submits at identical quality to one that didn't.

**Implications:** In-memory `AtomBytesStore` entries stay downsampled (preview + wire path unchanged, `buildWirePayload` untouched); the disk copy is the original.

#### [P05] Tier 2 scope: images only (DECIDED) {#p05-images-only}

**Decision:** The composer's durable tier covers exactly what attaches today — images from drop and paste. Non-images continue to insert as filename text.

**Rationale:** Parity first; widening scope changes wire semantics ([Q01]).

#### [P06] Tier 2 home: `data_dir()/draft-attachments/<uuid>.<ext>` (DECIDED) {#p06-draft-attachments-dir}

**Decision:** tugcast stores composer originals under `tugcore::instance::data_dir().join("draft-attachments")`, named `<uuid>.<ext>` with the extension derived from the media type (the `attachment_extension` mapping pattern from `feeds/operator.rs`).

**Rationale:** Mirrors the proven `gazette-attachments` layout one directory over; per-instance keeps instances isolated; UUID names need no collision logic and carry no meaning (the human name never mattered for composer images — chips are labeled `image-N`). The UUID in the name is also the GC's root-set key ([P08]).

**The media type is the original file's, not the entry's.** `AtomBytesEntry.mediaType` is the **post-downsample output** type — the store's own docblock says a PNG that hits the JPEG quality ladder comes back as `image/jpeg`. Since what we upload is the *original* ([P04]), deriving the extension from the entry's `mediaType` would write PNG bytes into a `.jpg` that `/api/fs/blob` then serves as `Content-Type: image/jpeg`. The `mediaType` query parameter on S02 is therefore always `File.type` from the dropped/pasted file, carried independently of whatever the downsample produced.

#### [P06a] Unmapped media types are refused, not stored under `.img` (DECIDED) {#p06a-no-img-fallback}

**Decision:** `attachment_extension` becomes `Option<&'static str>` over the extensions `/api/fs/blob` can actually serve. `feeds/operator.rs` keeps today's behavior by calling `.unwrap_or("img")`; S02 returns **415** when the mapping is `None`.

**Rationale:** The `_ => "img"` fallback writes a file `/api/fs/blob` cannot read back. `fs_blob`'s docblock is explicit that `Content-Type` comes from an extension table and *never* from sniffing, and an extension outside the table is refused rather than served as `application/octet-stream` — `img` has no arm in `mime_for_extension`. A `.img` attachment is therefore write-only: it consumes disk and can never rehydrate. Storing bytes we know we cannot read is worse than declining the upload, and declining it degrades to exactly today's behavior (in-memory chip, pruned on relaunch) rather than to a silent dead file.

**Implications:** SVG is the one live case. The drop gate (`IMG_EXTS` in `drop-extension.ts`) admits `svg`, but `fs_blob` has no `svg` arm — deliberately, since an SVG served from a loopback origin is a document that can carry script, and widening the blob route is not this plan's call to make. So an SVG drop keeps today's behavior: it attaches in memory, submits fine, and does not survive a relaunch. Stated rather than discovered.

**Follow-on (not this phase):** the `.img` fallback makes existing *Gazette* attachments of unmapped types equally unreadable — a live latent bug on that path, listed under Roadmap.

#### [P07] Durable card state carries references, not bytes (DECIDED) {#p07-cap-maps-not-strips}

**Decision:** `AtomBytesEntry` gains an optional `path` (absolute path of the stored original). `capDurableCardState()` stops deleting `content.attachmentBytes` wholesale; instead it maps each entry to `{content: "", mediaType, path}` — no image data of any kind ([P07a]). An entry with no `path` yet (upload still in flight, or upload failed) maps to `{content: "", mediaType}` and degrades exactly as today.

**Rationale:** The strip existed because entries were megabytes; a path is tens of bytes. The boot-bloat rationale evaporates while the seam (`capDurableCardState`) and its unit-test surface stay put.

**`content: ""`, not an absent `content`.** Two filters on the restore path require `content` to be a `string` and skip the entry otherwise: `AtomBytesStore.restore` (`atom-bytes-store.ts`) and `coerceAttachmentBytes` (`tug-prompt-entry.tsx`). Omitting the field would make every restored entry fail both filters — the feature would be a silent no-op. The empty string is also already the wire path's established signal for "preview-only, do not ship": `buildWirePayload` gates on `bytes.content.length > 0`, so a not-yet-rehydrated entry falls through to a mention marker exactly as a recalled thumbnail does today. No change to `buildWirePayload`.

**Both filters must also forward the new field.** `coerceAttachmentBytes` today reconstructs `out[id] = { content, mediaType }`, silently discarding anything else — it already drops `thumbnailDataUrl`. It must admit and forward `path`, and `AtomBytesStore.restore`'s field filter must do the same. Both are named in the Symbol Inventory.

**Implications:** Restore must distinguish "entry with path, empty content" (rehydratable) from "entry with neither" (prune, as today).

#### [P07a] No image data in durable card state — the thumbnail is re-derived (DECIDED) {#p07a-no-thumbnail-in-cardstate}

**Decision:** `capDurableCardState` persists no `thumbnailDataUrl`. On restore, a path-bearing chip paints a reserved slot until rehydration lands, at which point `downsampleImage` produces both the bytes and a fresh thumbnail. Prompt history is the exception and keeps its `thumbnailDataUrl` unchanged.

**Rationale:** A `THUMBNAIL_MAX_EDGE_PX = 512` baked data URL is tens of kilobytes; three of them is a couple hundred KB written on *every* durable save, including the synchronous `XMLHttpRequest` path in `putCardState` that runs at quit. That is not the 18 MB that motivated the original strip, but it re-grows precisely the surface that once stalled boot, and it would contradict this plan's own success criterion ("three short path strings"). The thumbnail is derivable from the bytes we are already fetching, so persisting it buys only the milliseconds before the fetch lands — and a reserved slot for one fetch is the exact behavior the Gazette attachment strip already ships.

Prompt history is a different case: its thumbnail is already there, already trimmed against `MAX_PROMPT_HISTORY_BYTES` (192 KiB), and a recalled prompt has no card-state restore to ride — the thumbnail is what makes a recalled entry legible before its bytes arrive.

#### [P08] Conservative startup GC for the draft tier (DECIDED) {#p08-gc}

**Decision:** At tugcast startup, sweep `draft-attachments/`: delete a file only if (a) **the UUID in its filename** appears in no value of tugbank domain `dev.tugtool.deck.cardstate` and no value of `dev.tugtool.prompt.history`, and (b) its mtime is older than 7 days.

**Rationale:** Closed-world root set (only those two producers exist), grace period per the git-gc / Joplin lesson: never delete eagerly on unlink.

**Why the UUID and not the path — [L29].** The obvious predicate is "does this file's absolute path appear in the roots' JSON," and it is wrong. A path has many spellings for one directory, [L29] is absolute that a compared path must pass the canonicalization gateway first, and here the consequence of two spellings failing to match is not an invisible dark row — it is **deleting bytes a live draft still references**, the exact loss this plan was written to end. Matching the `<uuid>` stem sidesteps the whole class: a v4 UUID has one spelling, cannot collide, and appears in a root value if and only if a surface still references that file. The sweep performs **no path comparison at all**, which is why it needs no gateway call and cannot drift.

**Implications:** Reference check is a substring scan for the UUID stem over the domains' JSON values — crude but sound in the safe direction (a false positive merely retains a file for another sweep). The sweep enumerates only files *directly* inside `draft-attachments/`; a filename whose stem does not parse as a UUID is left alone rather than guessed at.

#### [P09] Two upload routes, raw-bytes bodies (DECIDED) {#p09-two-routes}

**Decision:** `POST /api/attachments` (Tier 2: server picks the location per [P06], returns `{path}`) and `POST /api/fs/attach` (Tier 1: caller names the document and desired filename; server creates the sibling `assets/` dir, resolves collisions per [P03], returns `{path, relativePath}`). Both take the file's raw bytes as the request body (media type via header/query), not base64-in-JSON.

**Rationale:** Two policies (server-located vs. document-sibling) are cleaner as two small routes than one route with modes. Raw bodies avoid the 1.33× base64 + JSON-escape inflation that forced `fs_write`'s 6× body ceiling.

#### [P10] Text card stays raw-source; ⌘-click opens assets (DECIDED) {#p10-raw-source}

**Decision:** No widgets, no inline rendering. The inserted link gets the editor's existing markdown token styling; ⌘-click on a relative asset link resolves it against the document's directory and opens viewable extensions in the existing file-view card.

**Rationale:** The Text card's doctrine is "syntax never hidden" (its docblock excludes widgets deliberately); the anchor-links extension (`tug-text-card-editor/anchor-links.ts`) already owns the ⌘-click gesture for intra-doc anchors — asset links extend that grammar.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### Current composer attachment flow, and exactly what changes {#composer-flow}

Today (all paths verified in source):

1. Drop lands in `tugDropExtension`'s `onDrop` (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-text-editor/drop-extension.ts`); paste lands in `handlePaste` branch 1 (`tug-text-editor/clipboard-filters.ts`). Both call `processAttachmentFiles(view, files, insertPos, bytesStore, onError)` (exported from `drop-extension.ts`).
2. `processAttachmentFiles` preflights via `resolveDroppedFile` → `downsampleImage(file)`, mints a UUID per surviving image, `bytesStore.put(id, {content, mediaType, thumbnailDataUrl})`, then one `insertMixedAt` transaction inserts `U+FFFC` chips labeled `image-N`.
3. The prompt entry's `onSave` returns `{route, draft, attachmentBytes: attachmentBytesStore.snapshot()}` into the card-state bag; `putCardState` → `capDurableCardState` deletes `attachmentBytes`; restore → `coerceRestorePayload` → `pruneOrphanedImageAtoms` removes chips whose bytes are gone (`tug-prompt-entry.tsx`).
4. Submit: `CodeSessionStore.send` → `buildWirePayload(text, atoms, bytesStore)` emits interleaved `{type:"image", source:{type:"base64",…}}` blocks; entries with empty `content` (thumbnail-only re-seeds) fall through to a mention marker.

What changes, minimally:

- Step 2 additionally fires a background `POST /api/attachments?mediaType=<File.type>` with the **original** `File` bytes ([P06]: `File.type`, never the entry's post-downsample `mediaType`); on success it re-`put`s the entry with `path` added. The chip is never pending on this — the downsampled bytes are already in hand; `path` arrives whenever it arrives. If the app quits before the upload lands, the entry persists pathless and degrades as today.

  Two mechanics this needs to get right. **The re-put must not resurrect a deleted entry:** if the user removes the chip while the upload is in flight, `delete(id)` has already run, and a bare `put` would recreate a store row for an atom that no longer exists — and hand the GC a live-looking reference to bytes nobody can reach. The completion handler re-reads `store.get(id)`, bails when it is `null`, and otherwise merges `path` into the entry it found rather than reconstructing one from stale locals. **The original `File` must be paired by index:** `bytesToPut` carries only the `DownsampleResult`, and its indices diverge from `files` because a non-image or rejected entry resolves to `text` — the pairing is against the `resolved` array's index, not `bytesToPut`'s.

- Step 3's cap maps instead of strips ([P07]), carrying `{content: "", mediaType, path}` and no thumbnail ([P07a]). Restore keeps path-bearing atoms and fires rehydration: `GET /api/fs/blob?path=…` → `downsampleImage` on the fetched blob ([P04]) → `put` full entry, thumbnail included. The fetch-decode-put shape is exactly `hydrateGazetteAttachments` (`tugdeck/src/lib/gazette-attachment-bytes.ts`), including its chunked `toBase64` helper and in-flight interlock — extract the shared pieces rather than copying them. Note the two coercion filters that stand between the durable bag and the store (`coerceAttachmentBytes`, `AtomBytesStore.restore`) both have to forward `path`, and both reject an entry with no string `content` — hence `""` rather than an absent field ([P07]).
- Step 4 is untouched: an entry whose rehydration has not landed still has `content.length === 0`, which `buildWirePayload` already treats as preview-only.
- Prompt history: `SerializedAtom` (`tugdeck/src/lib/prompt-history-store.ts`) gains `path?: string` alongside its existing `id`/`thumbnailDataUrl`; recall re-seeds the store entry with `{content:"", mediaType, thumbnailDataUrl, path}` and triggers the same rehydration, making recalled prompts resubmittable. History entries are size-trimmed against `MAX_PROMPT_HISTORY_BYTES` (192 KiB, `settings-api.ts`) — a path string is negligible there.

#### Text card drop mechanics {#text-card-drop}

The Text card editor (`tug-text-card-editor.tsx`) installs no drop handling; `tugDropExtension` lives in the composer substrate's module but its drop-caret primitives are already exported (`dropOffsetAtCoords`, `paintDropCaret`, `clearDropCaret` in `drop-extension.ts`). The Text card gets its own small extension (new file `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-text-card-editor/file-drop.ts`) that reuses those primitives for the caret/ring affordance and, on drop:

1. For each `File`: read `arrayBuffer()`, `POST /api/fs/attach?doc=<abs doc path>&name=<file.name>` with raw bytes and `Content-Type: <file.type or application/octet-stream>`.
2. Insert one CM6 transaction at the drop offset with the returned links, space-separated: `![stem](assets/name.png)` for image media types, `[name](assets/name.zip)` otherwise, destination percent-encoded per [P03]. The insertion is a normal edit — dirty-state, manual/automatic save, aside crash-safety, and undo all apply unchanged (one undo removes the links; the asset files remain, per Risk R02).
3. A failed upload inserts nothing for that file and surfaces the error through the card's existing banner/sheet vocabulary.

The doc's absolute path is available on the store (`text-card-store.ts` owns it), and it is the gateway-canonical spelling — it came back from `openPath`'s resolution, and the route re-guards it anyway ([L29]).

An **untitled buffer is refused** with a notice ("Save the file first") — the one guard this needs. Not because it has no directory: `openUntitled` binds it to `asidePathForUntitled(draftId)` under the Tug asides root, so it has a very real one. The problem is that the directory is app-private and *temporary* — `saveAs` moves the document out of it — so an `assets/` folder written there would be invisible to the user and orphaned the moment the buffer is saved anywhere. The guard keys on `snapshot.path === null`, which is what the store sets for an untitled buffer.

Saving a *titled* document elsewhere breaks its links the same way; that is [R03], accepted for this phase.

#### Route specifications {#route-specs}

**Spec S01: `POST /api/fs/attach`** {#s01-fs-attach}

- Query: `doc` (absolute path of the markdown file being edited; guarded by `guard_absolute_path` + secret denylist, which is also the [L29] gateway — everything downstream is derived from its canonical output), `name` (desired filename; reject path separators, `..`, empty, and leading dots).
- **`doc` must resolve to an existing regular file** — 404 `not_found` otherwise. See the directory-creation note below.
- Body: raw file bytes. `DefaultBodyLimit`: 64 MiB.
- Behavior: `create_dir_all(parent(doc)/assets)`; resolve collisions by appending `-2`, `-3`, … before the extension until a name is free; write atomically (temp + fsync + rename, same discipline as `fs_write`); loopback-only.
- Response 200: `{"path": "<abs>", "relativePath": "assets/<final-name>"}`. Errors carry the shared `{"error": …}` body.

**Directory creation is a deliberate relaxation.** `fs_write` refuses to create a missing parent unless it lies under `drafts_root()`/`asides_root()`, and says so in a comment — an HTTP route that will `create_dir_all` anywhere is a bigger blast radius than a route that writes only into directories that already exist. S01 does create a directory anywhere on disk, and that is correct here: creating `assets/` next to the document is *what the user's drop gesture means*, and confining it to the Tug roots would defeat the entire portability argument for [P02]. The relaxation is bounded three ways — loopback-only, `guard_absolute_path` (no `..`, secret denylist), and the existing-regular-file requirement on `doc`, which means the route can only ever create a single `assets/` child of a directory that already holds a real file. It cannot `mkdir -p` into an arbitrary nonexistent tree.

**Spec S02: `POST /api/attachments`** {#s02-attachments}

- Query: `mediaType` (RFC 6838 string — **the original `File.type`**, not the entry's post-downsample media type; see [P06]). The extension is derived from it via the `attachment_extension` mapping, which moves from `feeds/operator.rs` into a shared module so both callers use one table.
- Body: raw file bytes. `DefaultBodyLimit`: 64 MiB.
- Behavior: `create_dir_all(data_dir()/draft-attachments)`; write `<uuid>.<ext>` atomically; loopback-only. No path is accepted from the caller, so there is nothing to guard and nothing to canonicalize — the response path is built from `data_dir()` and is canonical by construction ([L29]).
- Response 200: `{"path": "<abs>"}`.
- Response 415 `unsupported_media_type` when `attachment_extension` returns `None` ([P06a]) — the bytes are declined rather than stored somewhere `/api/fs/blob` could never read them back from.

#### State Zone Mapping {#state-zone-mapping}

| State | Zone (appearance / local-data / structure) | Mechanism | Law |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|
| `AtomBytesEntry.path` | external store data | `AtomBytesStore` entry field; no render dependency (read at save/rehydrate/submit) | [L02] |
| The stored path, as a persisted + compared value | external store data | Minted server-side from `guard_absolute_path` output (S01) or `data_dir()` (S02) — canonical at birth, so the deck only ever round-trips it. The GC compares UUIDs, never paths ([P08]) | [L29] |
| Rehydration in-flight set | external store data | module-level `Set` + store `put` on completion (gazette pattern) | [L02] |
| Chip pending appearance | appearance | existing `data-pending` DOM attribute via store subscription — unchanged | [L06] |
| Text card drop-active ring/caret | appearance | `data-drop-active` attribute + caret DOM element (reused primitives) | [L06] |
| Text card upload-failure notice | structure | existing card banner/sheet vocabulary | [L02] |

### Definitive Symbol Inventory {#symbol-inventory}

#### New files {#new-files}

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/attachments.rs` | Shared storage helpers (`attachment_extension`, atomic write, collision resolution) + both route handlers (Spec S01, S02) |
| `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/draft_gc.rs` | Startup sweep of `draft-attachments/` ([P08]) |
| `tugdeck/src/lib/attachment-upload.ts` | Deck client for both routes + shared rehydration (`fetch /api/fs/blob` → `downsampleImage` → `put`), extracted `toBase64` |
| `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-text-card-editor/file-drop.ts` | Text card drop extension (Deep Dive #text-card-drop) |

#### Symbols to add / modify {#symbols}

| Symbol | Kind | Location | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| `AtomBytesEntry.path` | field | `tugdeck/src/lib/atom-bytes-store.ts` | optional; `snapshot`/`restore` round-trip it |
| `AtomBytesStore.restore` | fn | `tugdeck/src/lib/atom-bytes-store.ts` | field filter must admit + forward `path`; still requires `content` to be a string, hence `""` ([P07]) |
| `capDurableCardState` | fn | `tugdeck/src/settings-api.ts` | map entries to `{content: "", mediaType, path}` instead of deleting the bag ([P07]); no `thumbnailDataUrl` ([P07a]) |
| `coerceAttachmentBytes` | fn | `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-prompt-entry.tsx` | **easy to miss** — reconstructs `{content, mediaType}` and silently discards every other field; must forward `path` or restore is a no-op |
| `pruneOrphanedImageAtoms` | fn | `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-prompt-entry.tsx` | keep path-bearing atoms; trigger rehydration |
| `processAttachmentFiles` | fn | `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-text-editor/drop-extension.ts` | background original-upload after `put`; liveness-guarded merge on completion, original `File` paired by `resolved` index (#composer-flow) |
| `SerializedAtom.path` | field | `tugdeck/src/lib/prompt-history-store.ts` | recall re-seeds with path; `thumbnailDataUrl` stays ([P07a]) |
| `attachment_extension` | fn | move `feeds/operator.rs` → `attachments.rs` | one MIME↔ext table for gazette + drafts; returns `Option` ([P06a]) — operator call site takes `.unwrap_or("img")` |
| `build_app` | fn | `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/server.rs` | register the two routes with body limits |
| `anchor-links.ts` token grammar | const | `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-text-card-editor/anchor-links.ts` | `TOKEN_SOURCE` is `#`-destination-only today and has no `!` branch — Step 8 must add the image form |

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Rust unit** | collision suffixing, extension mapping, GC root-set/grace logic, filename validation | `attachments.rs`, `draft_gc.rs` — pure fns tested directly, `cargo nextest run` |
| **Deck unit (bun)** | `capDurableCardState` mapping, `AtomBytesEntry.path` snapshot round-trip | existing `__tests__` pattern next to the modules |
| **App-test** | real drop → relaunch-shaped restore → resubmit; Text card drop → file on disk + link in doc | new `*.test.ts` with `@covers` for the touched sources; run via `just app-test-changed` |

#### What stays out of tests {#test-non-goals}

- No mocked-fetch or jsdom render tests — banned pattern; the app-tests drive the real routes on real bytes.
- No full-corpus app-test sweeps — selection via `@covers` only.
- GC is not app-tested (it runs at tugcast startup, before any test's first assertion) — covered at the Rust layer with a temp `draft-attachments/` fixture.

#### Step 1: tugcast attachment storage + `POST /api/attachments` {#step-1}

**Commit:** `tugcast(attachments): draft-attachment storage and upload route`

**References:** [P01] files not DB, [P06] draft-attachments dir, [P06a] no `.img` fallback, [P09] two routes, Spec S02, (#route-specs, #composer-flow)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/attachments.rs`: `attachment_extension` (moved from `feeds/operator.rs`, which now imports it) returning `Option<&'static str>` over the `/api/fs/blob`-servable set, atomic raw-bytes write helper (temp + fsync + rename, per `fs_write`'s discipline), `post_attachments` handler per Spec S02.
- Route registered in `server.rs::build_app` with a 64 MiB `DefaultBodyLimit`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `attachments.rs`; relocate `attachment_extension` and widen its return to `Option`; `feeds/operator.rs` calls it with `.unwrap_or("img")` so gazette behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.
- [ ] Implement `post_attachments`: loopback guard (same pattern as `jots.rs`), 415 on an unmapped `mediaType` ([P06a]), `create_dir_all(data_dir()/draft-attachments)`, `<uuid>.<ext>` atomic write, `{"path": …}` response.
- [ ] Register the route.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Unit: extension mapping over the servable set; every mapped extension has an arm in `fs_blob::mime_for_extension` (assert the two tables agree — this is the invariant [P06a] rests on); unmapped type yields `None`; write helper produces the exact bytes; response path is absolute and inside `draft-attachments/`.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

---

#### Step 2: `POST /api/fs/attach` (document-sibling assets) {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugcast(attachments): document-sibling assets upload with collision suffixing`

**References:** [P02] shared assets, [P03] name suffix, [P09] two routes, Spec S01, (#route-specs, #text-card-drop)

**Artifacts:**
- `post_fs_attach` in `attachments.rs`; route registered with its own body limit.
- Pure `resolve_collision_name(dir, name) -> String` helper.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Validate `name` (no separators, no `..`, non-empty, no leading dot); guard `doc` via `guard_absolute_path` + secret denylist ([L29] gateway), then require it to be an existing regular file — 404 otherwise.
- [ ] `create_dir_all(parent(doc)/assets)`; resolve `-N` suffix against existing entries; atomic write; `{"path", "relativePath"}` response.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Unit: collision suffixing (`photo.png` → `photo-2.png` → `photo-3.png`; extensionless names; dotfiles rejected); name validation rejections; relativePath shape.
- [ ] Unit: a `doc` naming a directory, or a path that does not exist, is refused before any directory is created (the bound on Spec S01's directory-creation relaxation — assert no `assets/` appears).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

---

#### Step 3: `AtomBytesEntry.path` + original upload on drop/paste {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugdeck(attachments): upload dropped originals and carry the stored path on bytes-store entries`

**References:** [P04] originals at rest, [P05] images only, [P06] original `File.type`, [P06a] 415 on unmapped, [P07] references not bytes, Spec S02, (#composer-flow, #state-zone-mapping)

**Artifacts:**
- `AtomBytesEntry.path?` in `atom-bytes-store.ts` (`snapshot`/`restore` round-trip it; `restore`'s field filter admits it).
- `tugdeck/src/lib/attachment-upload.ts`: `uploadDraftAttachment(file): Promise<string>` posting raw bytes to `/api/attachments?mediaType=<file.type>`.
- `processAttachmentFiles` (and the paste path, which shares it) fires the background upload per surviving image and merges `path` into the live entry on success; failure — including a 415 for a type the server will not store ([P06a], SVG being the live case) — logs to `tugDevLogStore` and leaves the entry pathless, which degrades to exactly today's behavior.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Extend the entry type + store round-trip.
- [ ] Wire the upload into `processAttachmentFiles` after the synchronous `put`. The chip stays never-pending. Pair the original `File` by the `resolved` array's index — `bytesToPut`'s indices diverge from `files` whenever an entry degrades to `text`. Send `file.type`, not `result.mediaType`.
- [ ] Completion handler re-reads `store.get(id)` and bails on `null`, then merges `path` into that entry — never reconstructs one. A chip deleted mid-flight must stay deleted (#composer-flow).
- [ ] `bunx vite build` clean.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Deck unit: snapshot/restore round-trips `path`; malformed-snapshot filter still admits path-less entries; an entry with `content: ""` survives `restore` (the [P07] contract).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test src/lib/__tests__/atom-bytes-store.test.ts && bunx vite build`

---

#### Step 4: Durable card state maps references; restore rehydrates {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `tugdeck(attachments): persist attachment references in card state and rehydrate on restore`

**References:** [P04] downsample at time of use, [P07] cap maps not strips, [P07a] no image data in card state, (#composer-flow, #state-zone-mapping), Risk R01

**Artifacts:**
- `capDurableCardState` strip 1 becomes a map: each `attachmentBytes` entry → `{content: "", mediaType, path}` (entries with no `path` map to `{content: "", mediaType}` and degrade as today). No `thumbnailDataUrl` in either case ([P07a]).
- `coerceAttachmentBytes` and `AtomBytesStore.restore` forward `path`. Both currently drop unknown fields and both reject a non-string `content` — until they are widened, nothing else in this step has any observable effect.
- `pruneOrphanedImageAtoms` keeps atoms whose entry carries a `path`; a new `rehydrateDraftAttachments(entries, store)` in `attachment-upload.ts` (gazette pattern: in-flight interlock, `GET /api/fs/blob`, `downsampleImage` on the fetched blob, `put` full entry incl. `path` and the freshly baked thumbnail).
- The prompt entry's restore path (`coerceRestorePayload` caller) invokes rehydration fire-and-forget, **after** the keep/prune decision — the prune reads the restored bag, not the eventual store contents, so the two must not race.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Rewrite cap strip 1 + its docblock (the ~18 MB rationale updates to "references only, and not even a thumbnail — [P07a]").
- [ ] Widen both coercion filters to forward `path`.
- [ ] Restore-side keep/rehydrate/prune split.
- [ ] Extract chunked `toBase64` from `gazette-attachment-bytes.ts` into the shared module; gazette imports it.
- [ ] `bunx vite build` clean.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Deck unit: `capDurableCardState` maps path-bearing entries, degrades pathless ones, leaves other bag fields alone, and emits **no** `thumbnailDataUrl` and no non-empty `content` for any entry ([P07a] — this is the Success Criterion's "short path strings" assertion).
- [ ] Deck unit: a capped bag round-trips through `coerceAttachmentBytes` with `path` intact (the regression guard for the filter that silently discards unknown fields).
- [ ] App-test (`@covers` prompt entry, drop-extension, settings-api): drop a real image, force a durable save + cold restore, assert the chip returns and submit ships a real image block.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build`
- [ ] `just app-test-changed`

---

#### Step 5: Prompt-history recall becomes resubmittable {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugdeck(attachments): prompt-history entries carry attachment paths; recall rehydrates`

**References:** [P07] references not bytes, [P07a] history keeps its thumbnail, (#composer-flow)

**Artifacts:**
- `SerializedAtom.path?`; capture at submit (the serializer already reads the store entry for `thumbnailDataUrl` — read `path` alongside). History's `thumbnailDataUrl` stays exactly as it is ([P07a]): it is what makes a recalled entry legible before its bytes land, it is already trimmed against `MAX_PROMPT_HISTORY_BYTES`, and a path string is negligible beside it.
- The recall re-seed in `tug-prompt-entry.tsx` (the `{content:"", mediaType:"", thumbnailDataUrl}` seeding site) includes `path` and triggers `rehydrateDraftAttachments`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Field + capture + re-seed + rehydrate call.
- [ ] `bunx vite build` clean.

**Tests:**
- [ ] App-test: submit with an image, recall via ↑ after a cold-restore-shaped reset, resubmit; assert a real image block (not a mention-marker fallthrough).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `just app-test-changed`

---

#### Step 6: Draft-attachments GC at tugcast startup {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugcast(attachments): conservative startup sweep of draft-attachments`

**References:** [P08] GC, [L29], Risk R01, (#route-specs)

**Artifacts:**
- `draft_gc.rs`: `sweep_draft_attachments(dir, root_json_values: &[String], grace: Duration)` — pure core taking the concatenated JSON values of `dev.tugtool.deck.cardstate` and `dev.tugtool.prompt.history`; startup call site in `main.rs` after the tugbank open (tugbank is fatal-if-absent per [D15], so the roots are always readable).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Pure sweep fn: files directly inside the dir; extract the UUID stem from each filename; substring-match **the UUID** against the roots; mtime > 7 days → remove. No path comparison anywhere in this function — that is the [L29] design, not an optimization ([P08]).
- [ ] A filename whose stem does not parse as a UUID is skipped, never guessed at.
- [ ] Wire into startup; docblock names the root-set contract (any future producer of these references must add itself — Risk R01 residual) and the reason the predicate is a UUID rather than a path, so a later refactor does not "simplify" it back into the bug.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Unit: temp-dir fixture — referenced+old kept, unreferenced+young kept, unreferenced+old removed; subdirectories untouched; non-UUID filename untouched.
- [ ] Unit ([L29] regression): a root JSON that references the file under a **different path spelling** for the same directory still retains it. This is the test that would have failed under the path-substring predicate and is the whole reason [P08] matches on the UUID.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

---

#### Step 7: Text card file drop → assets + markdown links {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugdeck(text-card): file drops write sibling assets and insert markdown links`

**References:** [P02] shared assets, [P03] name suffix, [P10] raw source, Spec S01, (#text-card-drop, #state-zone-mapping), Risk R02, Risk R03

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-text-card-editor/file-drop.ts`: drag ring + drop caret via the exported primitives (`dropOffsetAtCoords`, `paintDropCaret`, `clearDropCaret`), upload via `uploadDocAttachment(docPath, file)` (new fn in `attachment-upload.ts`), one insertion transaction with the returned links per the [P02]/[P03] link forms.
- Wired into `tug-text-card-editor.tsx`'s extension list; its "deliberately NOT here" docblock updates (drop is now here; atoms/completion still are not).
- Untitled-buffer guard keyed on `snapshot.path === null`: refuse with the card's notice vocabulary. The buffer *has* a directory — an asides draft path — which is exactly why the drop is refused (#text-card-drop).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Extension + wiring + link formatting (percent-encode destinations; image vs plain link by media type).
- [ ] Upload-failure notice through the card's existing banner path.
- [ ] `bunx vite build` clean.

**Tests:**
- [ ] App-test (`@covers` text-card, tug-text-card-editor, file-drop): drop a fixture PNG on a Text card over a temp `.md`; assert the asset file's bytes are identical to the fixture, the doc contains the expected link, and a second drop of the same name yields `-2`.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `just app-test-changed`

---

#### Step 8: ⌘-click asset links open a viewer card {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-7

**Commit:** `tugdeck(text-card): cmd-click relative asset links opens the file viewer`

**References:** [P10] raw source, (#text-card-drop)

**Artifacts:**
- `anchor-links.ts` grammar extended: a markdown link whose destination is relative and non-`#` resolves against the document's directory; viewable extensions (the `/api/fs/blob` MIME table's set) open via the existing open-file-in-card path (`tugdeck/src/lib/open-file-in-card.ts`); others no-op.
- The grammar must cover the **image form** `![alt](assets/x.png)` — that is the form Step 7 writes for every image, and it is the common case. `TOKEN_SOURCE`'s labelled-link branch is `\[[^\]\n]+\]\(#[\w-]+\)` today: `#`-destinations only, and no `!` in the alternation at all. Both need widening, and the `!` has to be accounted for in the match extents so the decorated range and the click target line up.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Grammar (image + plain form, relative destinations) + resolution + open call; decode percent-encoding before resolving.
- [ ] Resolve against the document's directory, then hand the result to the same guarded route everything else uses — no locally-assembled path is persisted or compared ([L29]).
- [ ] `bunx vite build` clean.

**Tests:**
- [ ] App-test: ⌘-click the `![…](assets/…)` link inserted in Step 7's fixture doc; assert a file-view card opens on the asset path. Cover the plain `[…](assets/…)` form too, since only one of the two exercises the `!` branch.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `just app-test-changed`

---

#### Step 9: Integration checkpoint {#step-9}

**Depends on:** #step-4, #step-5, #step-6, #step-7, #step-8

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** (#success-criteria)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Walk every Success Criterion end to end on a dash or debug build.
- [ ] `just app-test-covers-check` (every new test declares `@covers`).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Full selected suite green.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build`
- [ ] `just app-test-changed`

---

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** Durable attachment handling on both markdown-editing surfaces — Text card drops produce portable `assets/` files with standard links; prompt-entry image attachments survive relaunch and history recall as resubmittable originals — with no database, two small tugcast routes, and a conservative GC.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] All six Success Criteria verified (#success-criteria).
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` and `bunx vite build` clean; selected app-tests green.
- [ ] `capDurableCardState` docblock, `pruneOrphanedImageAtoms` docblock, and `tug-text-card-editor.tsx` docblock reflect the new reality (no stale "can't be re-resolved" / "the user accepts losing attachments across a cold boot" / "drop deliberately not here" claims).
- [ ] The `draft_gc.rs` docblock states the root-set contract and why the predicate is a UUID rather than a path ([L29]).

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] [Q01] durable non-image composer attachments.
- [ ] [Q02] attachment affordances for Jots / other editor hosts.
- [ ] Optional orphan-report tooling for Tier 1 `assets/` folders.
- [ ] [R03] Save As: either carry `assets/` along or warn when moving a document that carries relative asset links.
- [ ] Gazette's `.img` fallback ([P06a]): existing gazette attachments of unmapped media types are stored under an extension `/api/fs/blob` refuses to serve, so they can never be read back. Pre-existing, untouched here.
- [ ] SVG in the composer ([P06a]): `IMG_EXTS` admits it, `fs_blob` deliberately does not serve it, so SVG drops keep today's non-durable behavior.
