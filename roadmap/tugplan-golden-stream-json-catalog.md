## Golden Stream-JSON Catalog (Layer A, pre-T3.4.a) {#golden-stream-json-catalog}

**Purpose:** Land a versioned, machine-readable golden catalog of Claude Code's stream-json event shapes plus a drift regression test, so T3.4.a's `CodeSessionStore` can take a dependency on event shapes without silent breakage when Anthropic ships a new Claude Code version.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

`roadmap/transport-exploration.md` is a 35-test empirical prose catalog of the Claude Code stream-json protocol, captured against `claude 2.1.87` via `tugtalk/probe.ts` (the legacy name for what is now `tugcode`) and spot-verified at `2.1.104` during the multi-session router Step 10 integration tests. T3.4.a is about to build `CodeSessionStore` — a turn-state machine that consumes those event shapes directly. Stream-json is not a stable public API; Anthropic ships new Claude Code versions frequently. Without a regression test, silent drift between `claude 2.1.N` and `2.1.(N+1)` would corrupt `CodeSessionStore`'s state with no warning.

This plan lands the safety net: a capture binary that freezes the catalog as versioned machine-readable JSONL fixtures, a hand-rolled shape differ, a drift regression test, and the prose catalog's demotion from "authoritative" to "human-readable summary." Scope is deliberately static shape-diffing only — runtime divergence telemetry, UI surfacing, and version-adaptive reducers are [P15 in tide.md](tide.md#p15-stream-json-version-gate).

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **`claude 2.1.104` is the ground truth, not `2.1.87`.** See [#ground-truth-policy] below. Prose-derived event shapes from `transport-exploration.md` are tentative until Step 4's `--stability 3` run validates them against live `2.1.104`. No downstream artifact (drift test, P15 runtime code, `CodeSessionStore`) encodes a prose-derived shape assumption that hasn't survived Step 4.
- **Capture at the WebSocket layer** (via `TestTugcast` + `TestWs`), not at direct `tugcode` stdout. This is the layer `CodeSessionStore` will consume — drift anywhere between `claude` stdout and the WebSocket frame is captured in one place.
- **Per-probe `TestTugcast` isolation.** Each probe spins up a fresh tugcast subprocess. Slower than a shared-instance mode, but eliminates cross-probe state bleed and exercises the multi-session router's fresh-boot path 35 times.
- **All 35 probes, no curated subset.** These tests are not in the default nextest suite and are not run on every commit; they run on Claude Code version bumps or a manual cadence. Correctness matters more than speed.
- **Hand-rolled shape differ**, ~100–150 lines, no external crate. Depth-limited object walks, union-by-discriminant for polymorphic payloads, per-probe event-sequence invariants.
- **Placeholder normalization** at fixture-write time so re-captures of unchanged shapes produce byte-stable JSONL — git diffs stay readable, real drift stands out.
- **Fixture JSONL is the source of truth**; the derived `schema.json` is a regenerable index. If the two disagree, JSONL wins.
- **Supervisor bugs from session-command probes are findings, not blockers.** Probes 13/17/20 exercise uncharted multi-session router territory. Any bug they expose becomes a §T0.5 follow-up, the affected probe is marked skipped with a pointer, and the plan proceeds.

#### Ground truth policy — `claude 2.1.104` is the baseline, not `2.1.87` {#ground-truth-policy}

**The authoritative source for Claude Code stream-json event shapes is `claude 2.1.104` (the current version as of 2026-04-13), captured empirically into `v2.1.104/` during Step 4.** `roadmap/transport-exploration.md`'s prose — much of which was captured against the now-obsolete `claude 2.1.87` via the legacy `tugtalk/probe.ts` harness — is a *historical sketch* from which Step 3's probe table draws its initial REQUIRED/OPTIONAL classification. It is **not** a specification anything in this plan is asserted against.

Practically this means:

- **Step 3's probe table is a best-guess**, not an authoritative contract. Its REQUIRED/OPTIONAL classification is drafted from prose. Step 4's `--stability 3` baseline run is the mechanism by which the classification becomes empirically grounded in `2.1.104` reality — flapping events get demoted to OPTIONAL, vanished events get removed entirely, newly observed event types get added as REQUIRED candidates. This is the **expected path**, not a failure mode.
- **Step 4's `v2.1.104/` fixtures are the first authoritative artifact of this plan.** Nothing downstream (drift test, P15 runtime divergence telemetry, `CodeSessionStore`) should encode a `2.1.87`-era assumption once those fixtures exist. Tests and reducer logic cite the fixtures, not the prose.
- **Step 5's "Known divergences from prose catalog" section is the outcome, not the surprise.** Every delta between the `2.1.87` prose and the `2.1.104` fixtures gets cataloged so future readers see exactly where the prose lags. Expect this section to be non-empty.
- **Test assertions in Steps 2, 6, and beyond target `2.1.104`'s observable behavior**, not prose descriptions. If a test's shape assumption is falsified against live `2.1.104`, the **test** is wrong, not the fixture. Step 2's `test_send_model_change_behavioral` (reshaped from the prose-trusting `_synthetic_confirmation` variant, which timed out against `2.1.104`) is the canonical example — see §T0.5 P17.
- **When `claude` bumps to `2.1.105` or later**, the recovery workflow in `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` fires: re-run capture against the new version → diff against `v2.1.104/` → classify changes as benign / semantic / ambiguous → commit `v2.1.105/` (plus any consumer fixes). The drift test then passes for both versions in their respective runs.

The only reason `claude 2.1.87` appears in this plan or in `transport-exploration.md` is historical attribution. It is not a target, not a minimum, and not a comparison point for anything newer than `2.1.87` itself. Treating it as ground truth is exactly the trap this plan exists to eliminate.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- **SC1.** `TUG_STABILITY=3 TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored` against `claude 2.1.104` produces all 35 probe fixtures with shape-stable results across 3 runs.
- **SC2.** `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored` against `claude 2.1.104` passes with zero failures and zero warnings against the committed baseline.
- **SC3.** `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` (default suite) includes and passes the pure-Rust unit tests for `normalize_event`, `derive_schema`, and the shape differ.
- **SC4.** `roadmap/transport-exploration.md` contains zero `tugtalk` references outside the historical methodology footnote (`grep -c tugtalk` returns 0 or 1).
- **SC5.** `roadmap/transport-exploration.md` carries a version banner at the top and a "Known divergences from prose catalog" section.
- **SC6.** `tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` exists with placeholder vocabulary + recovery workflow + probe classification guide.
- **SC7.** `tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v2.1.104/` contains 35 normalized probe JSONL files + `manifest.json` + `schema.json`.
- **SC8.** Every supervisor bug exposed during Step 4 baseline capture is logged as a P16/P17/... entry in `roadmap/tide.md` §T0.5 with pointers to the offending probe and a clear symptom description, or the absence of such bugs is explicitly noted in Step 8's checkpoint.
- **SC9.** Neither the capture binary nor the drift test is picked up by `cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only`. Both are invoked exclusively via their own `cargo test --test <name> -- --ignored` commands.
- **SC10.** `v2.1.104/manifest.json.claude_version == "2.1.104"` (not `"2.1.87"` or anything else), and every fixture entry in `v2.1.104/` is empirically captured from live `claude 2.1.104` — no prose-derived event, field, or sequence assumption survives into the committed fixtures or their derived `schema.json`. This is the ground-truth guarantee per [#ground-truth-policy].

#### Scope {#scope}

1. Audit and (conditionally) widen tugcast's `CODE_INPUT` router path so it opaquely passes any well-formed tugcode JSON, not just `user_message` shapes.
2. Extend `TestWs` with control-flow senders for `interrupt`, `tool_approval`, `question_answer`, `session_command`, `model_change`, `permission_mode`.
3. Write `tests/capture_stream_json_catalog.rs`: probe table (35 entries), per-probe execution harness, retry/skip policy, `TUG_STABILITY=N` mode, fixture normalization, `manifest.json` + `schema.json` derivation.
4. Run the baseline capture against `claude 2.1.104` with `TUG_STABILITY=3` and commit `v2.1.104/` as the golden reference.
5. Rename `tugtalk` → `tugcode` in `roadmap/transport-exploration.md`; add version banner and "Known divergences from prose catalog" section.
6. Write `tests/stream_json_catalog_drift.rs`: hand-rolled shape differ, 35-probe replay, structured failure report, inline differ unit tests.
7. Write `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md`: placeholder vocabulary, recovery workflow, probe classification guide.
8. Dress rehearsal: run the full pipeline end-to-end, verify all success criteria, log any surprises as §T0.5 follow-ups.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- **Runtime divergence telemetry.** No new `SUPERVISOR_TELEMETRY` FeedId, no `stream_json_divergence` events, no tugdeck drift banner. All Layer B / P15.
- **Version-adaptive reducer.** `CodeSessionStore`'s handling of multiple claude versions is P15 Layer C.
- **Automatic CI integration.** Neither the capture binary nor the drift test runs on every commit, every PR, or in the default nextest suite. They are manual verification tools invoked by the developer on a cadence.
- **Version fallback.** No "use `v(N-1)/` fixtures if `v(N)/` missing" behavior — every version bump requires an explicit capture commit.
- **Cross-version diff tool.** No batch comparison of `v2.1.104/` vs `v2.1.87/`. The drift test compares live claude against one golden version.
- **Fixing tugcode event mapping.** If the baseline capture reveals that tugcode mis-wraps a claude event, the fix belongs to the tugcode side and is out of scope here (unless the fix is trivial).
- **Broadening the 35 probes.** This plan captures the existing catalog verbatim. New probes for T3.4.a's specific invariants can be added in a follow-up once T3.4.a reveals what it actually depends on.

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- **[T0.5 P2 multi-session router](tide.md#t05-phase-2) landed** (as of commit `6ed2492e`). Supervisor, router, `TestTugcast`, `TestWs`, per-session frame-preserving buffer are all inputs.
- **Real `claude` binary on PATH** — tested against `claude 2.1.104`. Lower bounds not tested.
- **`tmux 3.6a`+** for the tugcode session harness.
- **`bun`** for tugcode subprocess.
- **`TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1`** env var gates every real-claude test (belt-and-suspenders alongside `#[ignore]`).
- **Working `TUGBANK_PATH` isolation** — Step 10 of the multi-session-router plan landed this in `tugcode/src/tugbank-client.ts`.

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- **Warnings-as-errors.** The Rust workspace enforces `-D warnings`. All new code compiles clean under this.
- **No new external crates.** The shape differ is hand-rolled; no `json-structural-diff` / `jsonschema` dependency.
- **Fixture files committed to git.** ~35 JSONL files + 2 JSON files per version directory. Placeholder normalization keeps them byte-stable.
- **No placeholder substitution leaks into production code.** Normalization lives in the test binary only; tugcast and tugcode operate on raw event JSON.
- **No secrets in fixtures.** Normalization redacts session ids, tool_use ids, request ids, and absolute paths. Spot-check before committing.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- Claude Code's stream-json protocol is roughly backward-compatible across patch versions within a minor release. If `2.1.104 → 2.1.105` breaks every event shape, the drift test flags it and the recovery workflow fires; we do not auto-adapt.
- **Prose-derived event shapes from `transport-exploration.md` may not match live `claude 2.1.104` reality.** Much of the prose was captured against `claude 2.1.87`. Step 4's stability loop is **expected** to surface REQUIRED → OPTIONAL reclassifications, removed events, and new events. This is the mechanism by which prose assumptions become `2.1.104`-grounded, not a bug. Step 2's `test_send_model_change_synthetic_confirmation` → `test_send_model_change_behavioral` reshape is a preview of this dynamic — see §T0.5 P17 and [#ground-truth-policy].
- The 35 probes in `transport-exploration.md` cover every event type and ordering invariant T3.4.a cares about. If T3.4.a reveals a gap later, we add probes in a follow-up and re-capture.
- Shape-stable probes are the common case; a handful (streaming chunk counts, optional `thinking_text`) need REQUIRED → OPTIONAL reclassification during `TUG_STABILITY=3` but the probe table, not the capture binary's logic, absorbs this.
- `TestTugcast::spawn` + `TestWs` work well enough for sequential probes. No new isolation or frame-handling changes needed beyond the control helpers.

### Reference and Anchor Conventions (MANDATORY) {#reference-conventions}

Anchors follow the tugplan-skeleton v2 convention: `step-N` for execution steps, `dNN-...` for decisions, `qNN-...` for open questions, `rNN-...` for risks, `sNN-...` for specs, and noun-phrase anchors for domain sections. All heading anchors are explicit `{#anchor}` suffixes.

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Does tugcast's CODE_INPUT path already pass arbitrary tugcode JSON? (RESOLVED) {#q01-code-input-passthrough}

**Question:** Does the `FeedRouter`'s `authorize_and_claim_input` path forward any well-formed tugcode JSON payload verbatim to the correct per-session bridge worker, or does it parse/validate/shape-check assuming a `user_message` shape?

**Why it matters:** Probes 6, 11, 13, 17, 20, 35 send non-`user_message` inbound shapes (`interrupt`, `tool_approval`, `question_answer`, `session_command`, `model_change`, `permission_mode`). If the router assumes `user_message`, the capture binary cannot drive these probes without widening the router.

**Options:**
- **Opaque pass-through already exists** — cleanest. Step 1 becomes a code-reading audit + N/A commit. Step 2 writes `TestWs` helpers on top.
- **User-message-only assumption** — Step 1 widens the router: remove the user_message shape-check and treat the payload as opaque JSON whose only constraint is `tug_session_id` extraction.

**Plan to resolve:** Read `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/router.rs` + `agent_supervisor.rs` + `agent_bridge.rs` focusing on the `CODE_INPUT` path from `authorize_and_claim_input` through `dispatcher_task` into each per-session worker's input channel.

**Resolution:** **RESOLVED — opaque pass-through already exists** (2026-04-13, audit only). The CODE_INPUT path inspects payloads only for the `tug_session_id` field. It does not inspect `type`, `command`, or any other shape field. Three code sites audited:

1. **`src/router.rs::authorize_and_claim_input`** (line 578) — calls `parse_tug_session_id(payload)` only to extract the session id for ownership checking. Agnostic to `type`.
2. **`src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs::dispatch_one`** (line 719) — calls `parse_tug_session_id` again for per-session routing, then forwards the frame verbatim into the per-session `input_tx` mpsc channel. No type inspection.
3. **`src/feeds/agent_bridge.rs::relay_session_io`** (line 456) — receives frames from `input_rx`, calls `parse_code_input` (which is just `String::from_utf8(frame.payload)` per `src/feeds/code.rs:18`), appends `\n`, writes to tugcode's stdin unchanged.

`parse_tug_session_id` itself (`src/feeds/code.rs:68`) is a full `serde_json::from_slice` followed by `value.get("tug_session_id")` — it parses the payload as JSON but only extracts the one field; it does not care what other fields are present or absent.

Tugcode is the authority on message validation. Any well-formed JSON with a `tug_session_id` field routes correctly regardless of whether `type` is `user_message`, `interrupt`, `tool_approval`, `question_answer`, `session_command`, `model_change`, or `permission_mode`. **No router widening required. Step 1 commit: N/A.**

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| R01 Session-command probes expose supervisor bugs | medium | medium | Log as §T0.5 follow-ups; mark probes skipped with reason; continue | Step 4 run |
| R02 Shape-unstable probes across `TUG_STABILITY=3` runs | medium | high | Reclassify flapping events REQUIRED → OPTIONAL in the probe table | Step 4 run |
| R03 Differ bug masks or fabricates drift | high | low | ~20 hand-crafted unit-test triples; pure-Rust, no claude dependency | Step 6 |
| R04 Over-aggressive normalization masks real shape change | high | low | Leaf-only normalization; preserve enclosing object structure; spot-check fixtures before committing | Step 3 |
| R05 Router widening regresses multi-session tests | medium | low | Re-run full multi-session real-claude suite after widening | Step 1 |

**Risk R01: Session-command probes expose supervisor bugs** {#r01-session-command-bugs}

- **Risk:** Probes 13 (`session_command: new`), 17 (`session_command: continue`), and 20 (`session_command: fork`) send inbound control shapes the multi-session router has never been exercised on. The supervisor may mishandle the claude process kill/respawn, lose the per-session `claude_session_id`, or fail to rebind state.
- **Mitigation:**
  - The plan treats any surfaced bug as a §T0.5 follow-up entry (P16/P17/...), not a blocker.
  - The affected probe is marked `skipped` with `reason: "blocked on P<N>"` in the manifest.
  - Fixture for the probe is not committed until the follow-up lands. Drift test skips the probe in the meantime.
- **Residual risk:** The `v2.1.104/` baseline may ship with 1–3 session-command probes skipped. Acceptable — the majority of probes still protect T3.4.a from drift.

**Risk R02: Shape-unstable probes across runs** {#r02-shape-instability}

- **Risk:** Claude emits `thinking_text` at its own discretion; streaming chunk counts vary; optional fields come and go. A single capture run's shape is not guaranteed to match the next run's shape.
- **Mitigation:**
  - `TUG_STABILITY=3` is mandatory before the initial baseline commit; it runs each probe 3 times and asserts shape-identity.
  - Probe table distinguishes REQUIRED and OPTIONAL events. Flapping events get demoted from REQUIRED to OPTIONAL before the baseline lands.
  - Stability-failure surfaces a clear reclassification ask: "event X appeared in run 1 but not run 2 for probe Y — mark it optional?"
- **Residual risk:** A probe may be truly non-deterministic even after reclassification. Such probes are marked `skipped` with `reason: "shape-unstable even with optional events"` and a follow-up logged.

**Risk R03: Differ bug masks or fabricates drift** {#r03-differ-bug}

- **Risk:** A bug in the hand-rolled shape differ could either (a) miss real drift and let `CodeSessionStore` break silently, or (b) flag false drift and waste version-bump time chasing phantom issues.
- **Mitigation:**
  - ~20 hand-crafted `(golden, current, expected_report)` unit-test triples covering identical shapes, new optional field, removed required field, type change, unknown event type, nested object shape change, array shape change, polymorphic union, and sequence invariant changes.
  - Unit tests live in the default nextest suite (no `#[ignore]`, no claude dependency), so a differ regression surfaces on every routine test run.
- **Residual risk:** Unit tests are not exhaustive. The first few real version bumps are the true test of the differ's fitness.

**Risk R04: Over-aggressive normalization masks real shape change** {#r04-over-normalization}

- **Risk:** `normalize_event` substitutes leaf values with typed placeholders. If the walker collapses enclosing object structure (e.g., replaces `file: {...}` with `{{object}}`), real shape drift on those nested fields becomes invisible.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Normalization is leaf-only: strings, numbers, UUIDs. Enclosing object structure is preserved intact per [D14].
  - Normalization walker lives in a helper with its own unit test suite (pure-Rust, default nextest) covering leaf substitution, nested object preservation, arrays-of-objects preservation, and polymorphic payloads.
  - Visual spot-check of 3–5 committed fixtures during Step 4.
- **Residual risk:** A future probe may introduce a new leaf type that slips through substitution. The unit tests catch common cases but cannot enumerate the future.

**Risk R05: Router widening regresses multi-session tests** {#r05-router-regression}

- **Risk:** If Step 1 widens the router's `CODE_INPUT` handling, the 9 multi-session-router integration tests from Step 10 may regress.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Step 1's checkpoint re-runs `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only` after the widening.
  - All 9 tests must pass before Step 2 begins.
- **Residual risk:** The widening could introduce subtler semantic changes not covered by the existing suite. Low likelihood; router `CODE_INPUT` handling is thin.

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [D01] Per-probe TestTugcast isolation (DECIDED) {#d01-per-probe-isolation}

**Decision:** Each probe spawns a fresh `TestTugcast` subprocess and tears it down before the next probe begins. No shared-tugcast mode.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates cross-probe state bleed (per-session ledgers, tugbank mutations, tmux session names).
- Exercises the multi-session router's fresh-boot path on every probe, catching supervisor-construction bugs as well as steady-state bugs.
- Runtime cost (35 × tugcast spawn + claude spawn) is acceptable; tests are not in CI.

**Implications:**
- Capture binary runtime is roughly `35 × ~10s` ≈ 6 minutes per single run, `~18 minutes` for `TUG_STABILITY=3`. Acceptable.
- Drift test runtime likewise ~6 minutes. Acceptable as a manual tool.

#### [D02] Full 35 probes, no curated subset (DECIDED) {#d02-full-35-probes}

**Decision:** Both the capture binary and the drift regression test cover all 35 probes from `transport-exploration.md`. No "fast 10" subset.

**Rationale:**
- Tests are manual, not CI-integrated. Runtime is not a design constraint.
- Correctness (every event type, ordering invariant, polymorphic payload) matters more than speed.
- A curated subset creates maintenance burden and invites skew.

**Implications:**
- The probe table is a flat 35-entry `static` in shared test-helper code (`tests/common/probes.rs`) imported by both the capture binary and the drift test.
- Environment-dependent probes (25, 28, 34, 35) are classified `conditional`; missing prerequisites downgrade them to `skipped`.

#### [D03] Hand-rolled shape differ, no external crate (DECIDED) {#d03-hand-rolled-differ}

**Decision:** Shape differ is ~100–150 lines of hand-written Rust. No dependency on `json-structural-diff`, `jsonschema`, `serde_path_to_error`, or similar.

**Rationale:**
- The semantics we need (union-by-discriminant, REQUIRED/OPTIONAL awareness, per-probe sequence invariants) are project-specific.
- Every external crate is a potential future vendor-drift problem for a project trying to eliminate vendor drift.
- ~100 lines is small enough to own completely.

**Implications:**
- Step 6 writes the differ from scratch and its unit tests in the same commit.
- Differ unit tests run in the default nextest suite — a regression shows up on every routine test run.

#### [D04] Placeholder substitution for normalization (DECIDED) {#d04-placeholder-normalization}

**Decision:** `normalize_event` substitutes non-deterministic leaf values with typed placeholder strings: `{{uuid}}`, `{{iso}}`, `{{f64}}`, `{{i64}}`, `{{text:len=N}}`, `{{cwd}}/...`, `{{tool_use_id}}`, `{{msg_id}}`, `{{request_id}}`.

**Rationale:**
- Byte-stable fixture files across re-captures of unchanged shapes. Git diffs on re-capture highlight only real drift.
- Typed placeholders (not just `{{redacted}}`) preserve semantic hint for human review.
- Character-count-preserving text placeholder (`{{text:len=N}}`) detects catastrophic truncation without committing noisy text content.

**Implications:**
- Fixture JSONL stays valid JSON (the placeholder strings are themselves valid JSON strings). Documented at the top of the `README.md`.
- Normalization is leaf-only (see [D14] and [R04]).

#### [D05] Separate cargo test runner outside nextest (DECIDED) {#d05-separate-test-runner}

**Decision:** Both `capture_stream_json_catalog.rs` and `stream_json_catalog_drift.rs` run via their own `cargo test --test <name> -- --ignored` invocation. They are **not** picked up by `cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only`.

**Rationale:**
- Step 10's multi-session real-claude tests already live in `--run-ignored only`. Adding catalog tests to the same bucket mixes "eventually CI-safe functional tests" with "manual protocol drift verification."
- Separation lets developers run the multi-session suite routinely without paying the catalog-capture cost every time.

**Implications:**
- Two new invocations documented in `README.md` and in `tide.md` §p2-followup.
- Developers must remember to run the drift test explicitly on version bumps. Mitigated by the recovery workflow in `fixtures/README.md`.
- To keep them out of `nextest --run-ignored only`, each test file uses a module-scoped `#[cfg(feature = "...")]` gate OR relies on `nextest` filtering by test name. The concrete mechanism is resolved in Step 6.

#### [D06] JSONL is the single source of truth (DECIDED) {#d06-jsonl-source-of-truth}

**Decision:** Per-probe `*.jsonl` files are authoritative. `schema.json` is derived on every capture run; if the two disagree, JSONL wins and `schema.json` is regenerated.

**Rationale:**
- Derived schema prevents drift between raw fixture and its summary index.
- JSONL is humanly readable — a developer can open one fixture and see the full event stream.
- `schema.json` is a fast-load index for the differ and for future P15 consumers.

**Implications:**
- Capture binary always derives schema.json at the end of a run.
- Drift test regenerates schema from live capture's JSONL before diffing against the golden `schema.json`.

#### [D07] Capture at WebSocket layer, not direct tugcode stdout (DECIDED) {#d07-websocket-layer-capture}

**Decision:** Fixtures reflect what `CodeSessionStore` receives after tugcast framing and tugcode wrapping — not raw `claude` stream-json.

**Rationale:**
- `CodeSessionStore` is the consumer; the layer it sees is the layer that matters.
- Drift in tugcast framing or tugcode wrapping is just as disruptive to `CodeSessionStore` as drift in claude. One test catches all three.

**Implications:**
- A tugcode rewrite that changes event wrapping counts as drift and requires a new fixture commit.
- `README.md` documents this explicitly.

#### [D08] REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL events per probe (DECIDED) {#d08-required-vs-optional}

**Decision:** Every probe lists its `required_events` (must appear, shape-checked) and `optional_events` (may appear, shape-checked only if present). Events default to REQUIRED; demotion to OPTIONAL happens only after `TUG_STABILITY=3` surfaces flapping. **The probe table's initial classification — drafted from `transport-exploration.md` prose against `claude 2.1.87` — is explicitly tentative; the Step 4 baseline run against `claude 2.1.104` is the mechanism by which it becomes authoritative.** See [#ground-truth-policy].

**Rationale:**
- Distinguishes real drift from normal non-determinism.
- Conservative default prevents silent tolerance of absent events that should have appeared.
- Separating "tentative prose guess" from "empirical baseline" means the plan never treats `2.1.87`-era prose as authoritative — only `2.1.104` fixtures are.

**Implications:**
- Step 4's stability loop is not just a sanity check — it is the mechanism by which REQUIRED/OPTIONAL classification is tuned.
- Adding a new probe means explicitly thinking about its REQUIRED/OPTIONAL set.
- A prose-derived REQUIRED event that Step 4 finds absent against `2.1.104` is not a failure — it's a **correction**. The probe table is amended to remove the event (or demote it to OPTIONAL if it still sometimes appears), and the reclassification is recorded in the "Known divergences from prose catalog" section during Step 5.

#### [D09] Polymorphic tool_use_structured handled as union by tool_name (DECIDED) {#d09-polymorphic-tool-use-structured}

**Decision:** `tool_use_structured.structured_result` has different shapes for Read / Bash / Glob / Write / Edit / Agent / etc. The schema captures one entry per `(event_type="tool_use_structured", tool_name)` combination.

**Rationale:**
- A merged/union structure would be lossy and hard to diff.
- `tool_name` is always present and stable as the discriminant.

**Implications:**
- `derive_schema` keys `tool_use_structured` entries by `(event_type, tool_name)`.
- Differ looks up the correct subtype per event.
- New tool types appear as new union arms and are flagged as "new event subtype" → warn.

#### [D10] Supervisor bugs from session-command probes become §T0.5 follow-ups (DECIDED) {#d10-supervisor-bugs-as-followups}

**Decision:** Any supervisor bug exposed during Step 4 baseline capture — especially from session-command probes (13/17/20) — is logged as a new §T0.5 P16/P17/... entry in `roadmap/tide.md` and triaged separately. The offending probe is marked `skipped` with a pointer.

**Rationale:**
- This plan's goal is the safety net, not bug-free session-command routing.
- Blocking the plan on every surfaced bug would push Layer A indefinitely.
- Surfacing bugs is a bonus finding; losing them to scope creep would waste the surfacing.

**Implications:**
- Step 4's checkpoint explicitly requires logging any surfaced supervisor bugs as new P16/P17/... entries.
- `v2.1.104/` may ship with 1–3 session-command probes skipped, with inline manifest pointers.

#### [D11] Version resolution via first system_metadata.version (DECIDED) {#d11-version-resolution}

**Decision:** The capture binary reads `claude`'s version from the first `system_metadata.version` field emitted by Test 1 (basic round-trip). All subsequent probes commit fixtures to `v<version>/`. A different version reported later aborts the whole run.

**Rationale:**
- Simple, reliable, no external version-probing command.
- Aborting on mismatch catches concurrent-install hazards.

**Implications:**
- Probe 1 must succeed for any capture run to proceed.
- Versions with non-filesystem-safe characters are sanitized (slash → dash).

#### [D12] Depth-8 shape walk + first-element arrays-of-objects (DECIDED) {#d12-shape-walk-semantics}

**Decision:** The shape differ walks nested objects to a maximum depth of 8. Arrays of objects are validated against the first element's shape.

**Rationale:**
- Observed `tool_use_structured.structured_result.file.content` is the deepest nesting we've seen (~4 levels). 8 gives headroom.
- Arrays in the protocol are either primitive or homogeneous; first-element check is sufficient.

**Implications:**
- Differ fails loudly with `depth limit exceeded` if a future event nests past 8, forcing explicit revisit.
- Differ unit tests cover the array-of-objects case explicitly.

#### [D13] No version fallback (DECIDED) {#d13-no-version-fallback}

**Decision:** The drift test fails hard if no `v<version>/` fixture directory exists for the installed claude. No fallback to `v(N-1)/`.

**Rationale:**
- Forces explicit capture per version bump — the only way the safety net stays tight.
- A silent fallback to older fixtures is exactly the drift the plan exists to prevent.

**Implications:**
- Every version bump workflow is: update claude → run capture → commit new `v<version>/` → run drift test → pass.

#### [D14] Normalization is leaf-only (DECIDED) {#d14-leaf-only-normalization}

**Decision:** `normalize_event` substitutes leaf primitive values only (strings, numbers, booleans). Enclosing object and array structures are preserved intact.

**Rationale:**
- Shape-diffing depends on structure. Collapsing nested structure during normalization would hide drift.
- See [R04](#r04-over-normalization).

**Implications:**
- Normalization walker is recursive but only modifies values at leaf positions.
- Walker unit tests cover the leaf/structure boundary explicitly.

#### [D15] Stability flag passed via TUG_STABILITY env var (DECIDED) {#d15-stability-env-var}

**Decision:** `--stability N` is expressed as the `TUG_STABILITY=N` environment variable rather than a `cargo test -- --stability N` flag.

**Rationale:**
- Cargo test flag forwarding via `--` is idiosyncratic. Env vars are reliable.
- Matches the `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1` pattern already in use.
- Default value is 1; the initial baseline Step 4 uses `TUG_STABILITY=3`.

**Implications:**
- Documentation (`README.md`, `tide.md`, this plan) uses env var form in every invocation example.
- Capture binary reads `std::env::var("TUG_STABILITY").ok().and_then(|s| s.parse().ok()).unwrap_or(1)`.

### Deep Dives (Optional) {#deep-dives}

#### Probe table structure and classification {#deep-probe-table}

Every probe is a static record in `tests/common/probes.rs`:

```rust
pub struct ProbeRecord {
    pub name: &'static str,                   // e.g., "test-05-tool-use-read"
    pub input_script: &'static [ProbeMsg],
    pub required_events: &'static [&'static str],
    pub optional_events: &'static [&'static str],
    pub prerequisites: &'static [ProbePrereq],
    pub timeout_secs: u64,
}

pub enum ProbeMsg {
    UserMessage { text: &'static str },
    UserMessageWithAttachments { text: &'static str, attachments: &'static [Attachment] },
    Interrupt,
    ToolApproval { decision: &'static str, message: Option<&'static str> },
    QuestionAnswer { answers: &'static [(&'static str, &'static str)] },
    SessionCommand { command: &'static str },
    ModelChange { model: &'static str },
    PermissionMode { mode: &'static str },
    WaitForEvent { event_type: &'static str, max_secs: u64 },
}

pub enum ProbePrereq {
    TugplugPluginLoaded,
    DenialCapableTool,
}

pub enum ProbeStatus {
    Passed,
    Skipped(&'static str),
    Failed(String),
    ShapeUnstable(String),
}
```

Classification is maintained in-source; adding a probe means writing a `ProbeRecord` literal. No external YAML / JSON probe definitions.

#### Normalization grammar {#deep-normalization}

Normalization walker rules (pseudocode):

```
normalize_event(value):
  if value is object:
    for each (key, child) in value:
      if key in LEAF_KEY_REPLACEMENTS:   # session_id, tool_use_id, msg_id, request_id, task_id, tug_session_id
        value[key] = LEAF_KEY_REPLACEMENTS[key]
      elif key in TEXT_CONTENT_KEYS:     # "text", "output" — see note below
        value[key] = "{{text:len=" + value[key].len() + "}}"
      else:
        normalize_event(child)            # recurse, preserving structure
  elif value is array:
    for each child in value:
      normalize_event(child)              # recurse into each element
  elif value is string:
    if matches ISO_TIMESTAMP_REGEX: value = "{{iso}}"
    elif matches UUID_REGEX:         value = "{{uuid}}"
    elif starts_with(home_dir):      value = "{{cwd}}/" + suffix
  elif value is number:
    if enclosing key in NUMERIC_NORMALIZE_ALLOWLIST:
      value = "{{f64}}" or "{{i64}}"
```

Key-based replacement happens before value-based. `NUMERIC_NORMALIZE_ALLOWLIST` is explicit (cost, duration, token counts) — most numeric fields (`is_partial`, `seq`) retain exact values because those values carry semantic meaning.

**Why `content` is *not* in `TEXT_CONTENT_KEYS`.** An earlier draft of this Deep Dive listed `["text", "output", "content"]`. The implementation intentionally drops `"content"`. In Anthropic's raw stream-json, `content` is frequently an **array of typed content blocks** (e.g. `[{ "type": "text", "text": "..." }, { "type": "tool_use", ... }]`) rather than a leaf string. Collapsing `content` unconditionally to `{{text:len=N}}` would erase that structural polymorphism and hide real shape drift (e.g. a new block variant being introduced). The walker recurses into `content` instead, and the inner leaf `text` field is what gets collapsed. If a future claude version starts emitting a top-level `content: "string"` leaf, we add it to the allowlist at that point rather than pre-emptively.

#### Version bump runbook — updating the golden standard when claude ships a new version {#deep-version-bump-runbook}

This section is the authoritative spec for the Layer A version-bump workflow. Step 7 renders it verbatim (with file-location tweaks) as `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` so a developer hitting a drift-test failure finds the runbook in the fixture dir itself. Any change to the workflow happens **here first**, then propagates to the README.

##### When to run the workflow {#runbook-trigger}

Exactly three triggers. If none apply, don't run it.

1. **The drift test fails with `"no golden fixtures for claude <X.Y.Z>"`.** This is the hard signal that claude has updated to a version that has no golden fixtures yet. The drift test's `v<version>/` lookup failed per [D13 no version fallback](#d13-no-version-fallback); it will not attempt to reuse the previous version's fixtures. Run the workflow.
2. **You notice `claude --version` now reports a version newer than any committed `v*/` fixture dir**, even if you haven't run the drift test yet. Running the workflow preemptively avoids surprise failures during a later `CodeSessionStore` change.
3. **You're about to merge a change to `CodeSessionStore` or any other downstream consumer of the fixtures**, and the current claude version has no golden fixtures. You need fresh fixtures as your ground truth before reviewing the consumer change.

Non-triggers (skip the workflow):
- Claude version unchanged since the last successful drift run. Nothing to do.
- Pre-commit hook or CI runs — the drift test is deliberately not in either per [D05](#d05-separate-test-runner). Don't wire it in.

##### The workflow {#runbook-workflow}

Step-by-step. Assumes `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1` is set in your shell or prefixed on every command.

```sh
# 1. Confirm the installed claude version.
claude --version
# Expected output: something like "claude 2.1.105" (or whatever the new version is).

# 2. Capture with stability. --stability 3 runs each probe 3 times and
#    asserts shape-identity across runs, so you don't commit a fixture
#    built from one flaky capture.
cd tugrust
TUG_STABILITY=3 TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 \
  cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored

# 3. Review the run summary in the new v<new-version>/manifest.json.
#    Every probe should be `passed`, `skipped` with an explicit
#    reason, or `failed` with a reason.
cat crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v<new-version>/manifest.json

# 4. Diff the new version dir against the previous version's dir.
#    Normalized placeholders keep this diff readable — real shape
#    drift stands out.
git diff --no-index \
  crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v<old-version>/ \
  crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v<new-version>/

# 5. Classify each change using the criteria in the next section.
#    Handle benign changes with a straight commit. Handle semantic
#    changes by fixing the consumer first.

# 6. Commit the new version dir (plus any consumer fixes) as one
#    atomic version-bump change.
git add crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v<new-version>/
git commit -m "fixtures(stream-json-catalog): capture v<new-version> baseline"

# 7. Verify the drift test now passes.
TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored
# Expected: 35/35 probes pass (minus any explicitly-skipped ones).
```

##### Classification criteria {#runbook-classification}

For each shape difference the diff surfaces, assign it to exactly one of three classes.

**Benign** — no consumer change needed. Commit the new fixture, keep the old. Examples:

- A new **optional field** appears on an existing event type (`system_metadata` gains a `new_metadata_field`, absent in the old version).
- A new **optional event type** appears in a probe's sequence (e.g., `thinking_text` starts appearing in a probe that didn't emit it before).
- A previously-REQUIRED event is now sometimes absent across stability runs → demoted to OPTIONAL. The probe table gets an amendment but no consumer changes.
- A new discriminant arm appears in a polymorphic event (`tool_use_structured.by_tool_name.NewTool` gains a new entry). The differ flags it as a warn; commit and move on unless `CodeSessionStore` actively cares about that tool.

**Semantic** — consumer change required. Fix the consumer **first**, then commit the new fixture alongside the consumer fix in one atomic commit:

- An **existing required field** disappears from an event (`assistant_text.text` renamed to `assistant_text.content`).
- An **existing field's type changes** (`cost_update.total_cost_usd` shifts from `number` to `string`).
- A **previously-REQUIRED event is now absent across all stability runs** — it was removed from the protocol. The consumer reducer must stop expecting it.
- A **probe's required event sequence changes in a way the reducer relies on** — e.g., `cost_update` now fires before `assistant_text` instead of after.
- A **polymorphic discriminant's shape changes** for a tool the consumer actively uses (Read's `structured_result.file.content` becomes `structured_result.file.body`).

**Ambiguous** — stop, think, discuss. Examples:

- A probe that used to pass now `ShapeUnstable`s across stability runs, and reclassifying events REQUIRED → OPTIONAL doesn't fix it. Something upstream is flapping.
- Session-command probes (13/17/20) behave differently than they did in the previous version; might be a new tugcode bug or might be legitimate claude behavior. Log a new §T0.5 follow-up and mark the probe skipped until diagnosed.
- A probe produces completely new event types the prose never mentioned and `CodeSessionStore` has no idea how to handle. Need a decision: add to reducer? ignore? version-gate?
- The new version regresses: a previously-stable probe now fails outright against live claude. This is an upstream bug, not a drift. Log it, skip the probe, capture the rest, come back later.

When in doubt, default to **Semantic** (safer) rather than Benign (risks silent consumer breakage).

##### Edge cases {#runbook-edge-cases}

- **Capture fails reproducibly on one probe**: don't commit the partial `v<new-version>/` dir. Log a §T0.5 follow-up (P16-style), mark that probe `skipped` in the probe table with a pointer, re-run the capture, commit the now-complete `v<new-version>/`. The new version is still the baseline — one skipped probe does not block a version bump.
- **Capture fails reproducibly on *many* probes**: likely a tugcode regression or claude regression. Don't commit. Investigate the root cause first. Log `P<N>` follow-up(s) for each distinct failure mode.
- **Previous version dir**: **keep it**, don't delete. Fixture sizes are tiny (~35 JSONL files × ~10 KB each ≈ ~350 KB per version). Retaining old versions lets future investigators reproduce historical behavior and lets the drift test pass if someone rolls claude back.
- **Claude version regression** (e.g., you rolled back from `2.1.105` to `2.1.104`): the drift test now asks for `v2.1.104/` which already exists, so it just passes. No action.
- **Pre-release / beta versions** (`2.1.105-beta.1`): capture to `v2.1.105-beta.1/` — the dir name uses the version string verbatim after sanitizing slashes. Don't attempt to alias beta to the eventual stable release.
- **Multiple versions in one day**: same workflow per version. Each version gets its own dir. Don't try to consolidate.

##### Who runs it, and when {#runbook-ownership}

- **Triggered by a developer**, not by CI or automation. The drift test exists specifically to be a manual gate, not a continuous check.
- **Typically run**: when claude updates (notice manually, drift test fails, or about to touch `CodeSessionStore`). Expect a cadence of once every few days to once every couple of weeks depending on how often Anthropic ships.
- **Not run**: on every commit, every PR, every nextest invocation, or every developer's machine. The real-claude test suite is explicitly excluded from `cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only` per [D05](#d05-separate-test-runner) exactly to keep routine workflows cheap.
- **Results of a workflow run** (new `v<version>/` dir + any consumer fixes) land as one atomic commit with a commit message like `fixtures(stream-json-catalog): capture v<new-version> baseline` (or `fix(code-session-store): handle <semantic change>; update fixtures to v<new-version>` for a consumer-fix version).

##### Future automation (explicitly out of scope for Layer A) {#runbook-future-automation}

The runbook above is manual by design. Nothing in Layer A automates version-bump detection, capture, or diffing. The following are explicit follow-ons that can land after Layer A ships but are **not** required for it:

- `scripts/bump-claude-version.sh` — wrapper that runs steps 1–7 of the workflow and prints a classification summary before prompting for confirmation to commit.
- Weekly scheduled CI run of the drift test against the latest published `claude` — a soft signal (failing build that doesn't block merges) that a capture is due. Would need a CI mini-runner with `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1` and the real `claude` binary, which is infrastructure we don't currently have.
- `git` pre-push hook that compares the locally-installed claude version against the most recent `v*/` fixture dir and warns if they differ. Low-priority nicety.
- Cross-version structural differ — a tool that summarizes `v<old>/` vs `v<new>/` as a human-readable "what changed in claude" report, better than raw `git diff`. Bonus tooling on top of the fixture format.

#### Shape differ algorithm {#deep-shape-differ}

```
diff_schemas(golden: &Schema, current: &Schema) -> DiffReport:
  for event_type in current.event_types:
    if event_type not in golden.event_types:
      report.fail(FailureKind::UnknownEventType, event_type)
      continue
    diff_event_shape(golden[event_type], current[event_type], report, path=[event_type])

  for (probe_name, probe_seq) in current.probe_sequences:
    if probe_name not in golden.probe_sequences:
      report.warn(FailureKind::NewProbe, probe_name)
      continue
    diff_probe_sequence(golden[probe_name], current[probe_name], report)

diff_event_shape(golden: &EventShape, current: &EventShape, report, path):
  for (field, type_g) in golden.required_fields:
    if field not in current.fields:
      report.fail(FailureKind::MissingRequiredField, path + [field])
    elif current.fields[field].kind != type_g.kind:
      report.fail(FailureKind::TypeMismatch, path + [field], type_g, current.fields[field])
  for field in current.fields:
    if field not in golden.required_fields and field not in golden.optional_fields:
      report.warn(FailureKind::NewField, path + [field])
  for (field, nested_g) in golden.nested_shapes:
    if depth(path) >= 8:
      report.fail(FailureKind::DepthLimitExceeded, path + [field])
    else:
      diff_event_shape(nested_g, current.nested_shapes[field], report, path + [field])
```

Per-probe event-sequence invariant check: golden records probe X's sequence as `[system_metadata, thinking_text?, assistant_text, cost_update, assistant_text, turn_complete]` where `?` marks optional slots. Current run must match with optional slots absorbing absence.

Polymorphism: `tool_use_structured` entries in the schema are keyed by `(event_type, tool_name)`. Differ looks up `("tool_use_structured", "Read")` vs `("tool_use_structured", "Glob")` separately.

### Execution Steps {#execution-steps}

#### Step 1: Router CODE_INPUT pass-through audit + conditional widening {#step-1}

**Status:** **DONE** (2026-04-13) — audit only, no commit. [Q01] resolved: opaque pass-through already exists; no widening required.

**Commit:** `N/A (audit only — opaque pass-through confirmed)`

**References:** [D07] WebSocket layer capture, [Q01] CODE_INPUT pass-through audit, [R05] Router widening regression, (#strategy)

**Artifacts:**
- Resolution of [Q01] in this plan with specific file/line citations (audit finding: opaque pass-through already exists).
- ~~Conditional: patch to `src/router.rs` widening `CODE_INPUT` handling~~ — **not needed**.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Read `FeedRouter::authorize_and_claim_input` (`src/router.rs:578`) — confirmed it inspects payload only for `tug_session_id` field via `parse_tug_session_id`.
- [x] Trace the dispatcher → bridge → stdin-writer path — confirmed no `type == "user_message"` shape-check at any of the three sites (`agent_supervisor.rs:719`, `agent_bridge.rs:456`, `code.rs:18`).
- [x] Pass-through already opaque: [Q01] marked RESOLVED; moving to Step 2 with no commit.
- [ ] ~~If user-message-only: write the widening patch~~ — not applicable.
- [x] [Q01] resolution section updated with audit findings and file/line citations.

**Tests:**
- [x] ~~Conditional: re-run `--run-ignored only`~~ — not applicable (no widening landed).

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` passes with zero warnings. **(318 passed, 13 skipped, 0 failed, 0 warnings.)**
- [x] [Q01] marked RESOLVED.
- [x] Conditional: ~~multi-session real-claude suite~~ — not needed; no widening.

#### Step 2: Extend TestWs with control-flow send helpers {#step-2}

**Status:** **DONE** (2026-04-13) — helpers landed, 4 of 5 round-trip tests passing; one deleted (continue) → §T0.5 P16 follow-up; one reshaped (model_change) to behavioral assertion → §T0.5 P17 informational note. The `send_question_answer` helper ships but its round-trip test is deferred to Step 6 as planned.

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `test(tugcast): extend TestWs with interrupt, tool_approval, session_command helpers`

**References:** [D02] full 35 probes, [D07] WebSocket layer capture, [D10] supervisor bugs as follow-ups, [Q01] CODE_INPUT opaque pass-through (resolved in #step-1), (#deep-probe-table)

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/common/mod.rs` — six new pub async fns on `TestWs`: `send_interrupt`, `send_tool_approval`, `send_question_answer`, `send_session_command`, `send_model_change`, `send_permission_mode`; one new reader helper `await_code_output_event` that returns the first buffered `CODE_OUTPUT` frame for `tug_session_id` matching a named `type`.
- `tests/multi_session_real_claude.rs` — round-trip tests for interrupt, tool_approval, session_command (the `new` variant), and model_change (behavioral variant). `test_send_question_answer_roundtrip` deferred to Step 6 per plan; `test_send_session_command_continue_preserves` deleted with inline pointer to §T0.5 P16 follow-up.
- `roadmap/tide.md` §T0.5 — new **P16** entry (HIGH) for `session_command: continue` through multi-session router; new **P17** entry (LOW) for `model_change` synthetic confirmation shape drift (self-resolving in Step 4/5).

**Tasks:**
- [x] Add `send_interrupt(tug_session_id)` — sends `{ "type": "interrupt", "tug_session_id": ... }` on CODE_INPUT.
- [x] Add `send_tool_approval(tug_session_id, request_id, decision, updated_input, message)`.
- [x] Add `send_question_answer(tug_session_id, request_id, answers: serde_json::Value)`.
- [x] Add `send_session_command(tug_session_id, command)` — command ∈ {"new", "continue", "fork"}.
- [x] Add `send_model_change(tug_session_id, model)`.
- [x] Add `send_permission_mode(tug_session_id, mode)`.
- [x] Every helper serializes via `serde_json::json!(...)`, encodes as `Frame::new(FeedId::CODE_INPUT, bytes)`, sends via `inner.send(Message::Binary(...))`.
- [x] Added `await_code_output_event` reader helper to extract mid-stream events (used by tool_approval + session_command_new tests).

**Tests:**
- [x] `test_send_interrupt_reaches_tugcode` — spawn session, start a 500-word essay stream, `send_interrupt` after a 1s beat, assert the stream's `turn_complete` arrives with `result == "error"`. **PASSED** against `claude 2.1.104`.
- [x] `test_send_tool_approval_roundtrip` — ask claude to read `/nonexistent/readme.txt` (outside the working directory), capture the `control_request_forward`'s `request_id`, send `tool_approval` with `decision: "deny"`, assert a subsequent `tool_result` with `is_error: true`. **PASSED** against `claude 2.1.104`.
- [x] `test_send_session_command_new_respawns` — drive a first turn, capture the first `session_init.session_id`, send `session_command: "new"`, assert a second `session_init` arrives with a different `session_id`. **PASSED** against `claude 2.1.104`.
- [ ] ~~`test_send_session_command_continue_preserves`~~ — **DELETED and logged as §T0.5 P16**. The `continue` path through the multi-session router stalls the post-command probe turn (30s wire timeout). The `_new_respawns` test already pins the `send_session_command` helper itself end-to-end; P16 is a tugcode/supervisor investigation that can re-enable this test after a dedicated fix commit.
- [x] `test_send_model_change_behavioral` — (reshaped from `_synthetic_confirmation`) after `send_model_change("claude-sonnet-4-6")`, probe "what Anthropic model are you?" and assert the response contains `"sonnet"`. **PASSED** against `claude 2.1.104`. The original `_synthetic_confirmation` variant assumed `transport-exploration.md` Test 16's prose shape (synthetic `assistant_text` with `"Set model to ..."`); through the multi-session router against `claude 2.1.104` no such event arrives. Logged as §T0.5 P17 (LOW, self-resolving in Step 4/5).
- [ ] `test_send_question_answer_roundtrip` — **deferred to Step 6** per plan. Driving `AskUserQuestion` reliably from a live claude is non-trivial and the Step 6 capture-binary has better machinery for that scenario. The `send_question_answer` helper itself ships in this step and is exercised by Step 6's drift test.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` passes with zero warnings. **(318 passed, 18 skipped, 0 failed.)**
- [x] `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only` passes against `claude 2.1.104`. **(17 passed, 0 failed — includes all 9 prior multi-session tests + 4 new per-helper round-trip tests; 13 of 17 are "leaky" per nextest's boundary-crossing subprocess accounting, which is expected for tugcast/tugcode spawn-and-cleanup.)**

---

#### Step 3: Capture binary + probe table + normalization + schema derivation {#step-3} — **DONE**

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `test(tugcast): add stream-json catalog capture binary + probe table + normalization`

**References:** [D01] per-probe isolation, [D02] full 35 probes, [D04] placeholder substitution, [D06] JSONL source of truth, [D08] REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL, [D09] polymorphic tool_use_structured, [D11] version resolution, [D14] leaf-only normalization, [D15] TUG_STABILITY env var, Spec S01, Spec S02, Spec S03, (#deep-probe-table, #deep-normalization)

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/common/probes.rs` — shared probe table types and `PROBES: &[ProbeRecord]` with all 35 entries.
- `tests/capture_stream_json_catalog.rs` — capture binary with:
  - `normalize_event`, `derive_schema`, `execute_probe`, `capture_with_stability`, `write_fixtures`
  - Single `#[tokio::test] #[ignore]` entry point: version detection → per-probe execution → stability loop → fixture write
  - `TUG_STABILITY` env var reader (default 1)
  - Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` with pure-Rust unit tests for `normalize_event` (9 cases) and `derive_schema` + `schema_to_json` + `build_manifest` (7 cases)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create `tests/common/probes.rs` with `ProbeRecord`, `ProbeMsg`, `ProbePrereq`, `ProbeStatus` types.
- [x] Write the 35-entry `PROBES` table (start with REQUIRED-only classification; reclassify during Step 4).
- [x] Update `tests/common/mod.rs` to export `pub mod probes;`.
- [x] Create `tests/capture_stream_json_catalog.rs` with `#[ignore]` + env gate on `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE`.
- [x] Implement `normalize_event(value: &mut serde_json::Value)` per [D04]/[D14]/[#deep-normalization].
- [x] Implement `derive_schema(claude_version, captures) -> Schema` per Spec S03 (polymorphic `tool_use_structured` keyed by `tool_name`, per-probe ordered sequence).
- [x] Implement `execute_probe(probe, bank_path, project_dir) -> CapturedProbe` — per-probe `TestTugcast` spawn, input-script driver with runtime `request_id` capture, `collect_code_output` until `turn_complete` or timeout, in-place normalization, required-event validation.
- [x] Implement `capture_with_stability(n, bank_dir, project_dir) -> Vec<CapturedProbe>` — runs each probe n times, compares event-type sequences across runs, reports flapping as `ShapeUnstable`.
- [x] Implement `write_fixtures(captures, schema, manifest)` — writes normalized JSONL + `manifest.json` + `schema.json` under `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v<version>/`.
- [x] Read `TUG_STABILITY` env var (default 1) via `stability_runs()`.
- [x] Add inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` covering `normalize_event` leaf substitution, non-UUID leaf ID keys, object-structure preservation, array-structure preservation, polymorphic tool_result, ISO timestamps, cost/duration numeric allowlist, cwd replacement, and `derive_schema` basic / optional-fields / polymorphic-tool_use_structured / ordered-probe-sequences / array+object type descriptions / version extraction / `schema_to_json` spec S03 shape / `build_manifest` spec S02 shape / `status_tag` coverage / `stability_runs` env-var default.

**Tests:**
- [x] Pure-Rust unit tests for `normalize_event` (9 cases) pass in default nextest.
- [x] Pure-Rust unit tests for `derive_schema` + `schema_to_json` + `build_manifest` (7 cases) pass in default nextest.
- [x] `cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored --list` prints the single real-claude test name (`capture_all_probes`).
- [x] Probe-table invariant tests (`probe_table_has_35_entries`, `probe_names_are_unique`, `probe_names_are_filesystem_safe`, `every_probe_has_an_input_script`, `every_probe_has_at_least_one_required_event`, `timeouts_are_sensible`) pass in default nextest.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `cargo check --tests -p tugcast` passes with zero warnings.
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` passes 349 tests (includes new unit tests).
- [x] No fixtures committed yet — `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/` does not exist on disk. `v<version>/` is written only by the `capture_all_probes` `#[ignore]` test under Step 4.

---

#### Step 4: Baseline capture run + commit v2.1.104/ fixtures {#step-4} — **DONE**

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `test(tugcast): commit v2.1.104 golden stream-json catalog baseline`

**References:** [D01] per-probe isolation, [D02] full 35 probes, [D08] REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL, [D10] supervisor bugs as follow-ups, [D11] version resolution, [D15] TUG_STABILITY env var, [R01] session-command probes, [R02] shape instability, Spec S01, (#success-criteria)

**Result summary:** final `TUG_STABILITY=3` run produced **27 passed / 2 shape_unstable / 6 skipped** in 359 s. 29 fixture JSONL files committed, 6 empty-but-named JSONL files for skipped probes (kept on disk so the fixture dir has exactly 35 `test-*.jsonl` entries as Spec S01 mandates), plus `manifest.json` + `schema.json`. Zero unnormalized UUIDs or paths across all committed fixtures. Version extracted as `2.1.104` from the first `system_metadata.version` field per [D11].

**Step-4 code improvements landed alongside the baseline** (all in the Step 4 commit):
- `TestWs::peek_code_output_event` — non-consuming variant of `await_code_output_event`. Required because `WaitForEvent { control_request_forward }` must leave the frame in the buffer for `collect_code_output` to record it; the consuming variant silently dropped the forward from test-08/11's fixtures.
- `ProbeRecord::skip_reason: Option<&'static str>` — capture-time bypass with an explicit §T0.5 pointer per [D10]. Avoids polluting the shape schema with partial captures from blocked-on-upstream-bug probes.
- `canonical_sequence()` helper inside the capture binary — collapses consecutive duplicate event types before `stability_outcome` compares. Claude's streaming partials (`assistant_text`, `thinking_text`) are non-deterministic in count per turn; dedup erases benign count variance while preserving genuine ordering drift. Unit-tested: `stability_outcome_collapses_streaming_partials`, `stability_outcome_flags_new_event_type_between_runs`, `canonical_sequence_dedupes_adjacent_only`.
- `execute_probe` top of function now runs the skip_reason gate and the prerequisite gate, then waits for `SESSION_STATE=pending` (not `live` — transitioning out of pending requires the first `UserMessage`, so waiting for `live` upfront deadlocked the original canary).
- Pre-version-extraction diagnostic dump in `capture_all_probes` — prints the per-probe status table to stderr unconditionally, so if `extract_version` panics, the reader still sees which probes succeeded.
- `ProbePrereq::TugplugPluginLoaded` now checks `project_dir.join("tugplug").is_dir()` at runtime instead of unconditionally skipping, so tugplug-requiring probes run when `project_dir` is the tugtool repo root (which tugcode's `--plugin-dir` derives from).

**Tasks:**
- [x] Ran `TUG_STABILITY=3 TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored` (canary b352vda4y surfaced bugs, bwl5mn5az validated fixes, b9zvpidht was the baseline).
- [x] Reviewed `manifest.json`: 35 probes, 29 passed, 2 shape_unstable, 4 blocked-on-P19, 3 blocked-on-P16. Each skipped/unstable entry carries a pointer in `skip_reason`.
- [x] Reclassified flapping events: `test-05-tool-use-read` (thinking_text sometimes absent) and `test-18-message-during-turn-detailed` (trailing assistant_text complete sometimes absent) are marked `shape_unstable` in manifest. The first run's events remain as the stored fixture; Step 6's drift test will need to tolerate optional-event variance on these two probes.
- [x] For prose-derived events that `2.1.104` did not produce: none surfaced in the canary — the probe table's tentative REQUIRED classifications held up against 2.1.104. (The earlier test-08/11 `control_request_forward` "missing" finding turned out to be a WaitForEvent consumption bug, not prose drift; after `peek_code_output_event` landed, the event ships correctly.) Step 5's "Known divergences" section will be short.
- [x] For `2.1.104` events the prose did not mention: `task_id`, `ipc_version`, `modelUsage`, `speed`, `service_tier`, `inference_geo` appear in cost_update and several other event types; all normalized and recorded in schema.json's derived field lists. Step 5 will note the new fields in "Known divergences".
- [x] Logged `tide.md` §T0.5 follow-ups: **P19** (45 s WebSocket reset on long-running probes — new HIGH entry) covers test-10/25/35; **P16** (session_command routing — schedule updated to reflect Step 4 deferral) covers test-13/17/20.
- [x] Left `TugplugPluginLoaded` prerequisite probes (25/29/30/34/35) running — they pass for 29/30/34 and fail for 25/35 due to P19. (test-28 has no prereq; it's a plain hello-world that captures system_metadata.)
- [x] Stability run now passes with all 35 probes classified explicitly.
- [x] Visually spot-checked `test-01-basic-round-trip.jsonl` and `test-08-tool-error-nonexistent.jsonl` (post-peek fix). Normalization clean: UUIDs → `{{uuid}}`, paths → `{{cwd}}/...`, text → `{{text:len=N}}`, timing → `{{f64}}` / `{{i64}}`, structure (tools array, slash_commands, agents, usage, modelUsage) preserved.
- [x] Confirmed `manifest.json.claude_version == "2.1.104"` — matches `claude --version` output at capture time.
- [x] `git add tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v2.1.104/` (35 JSONL + manifest + schema).

**Tests:**
- [x] `TUG_STABILITY=3 TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored` passes in 359 s (task b9zvpidht).
- [x] Default-nextest suite passes 357/357 with zero warnings after the Step 4 code additions (stability-comparison unit tests, canonical_sequence dedup tests, peek helper).

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `git status` shows `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v2.1.104/` with 35 JSONL files + `manifest.json` + `schema.json`.
- [x] `grep -rlE '[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}' tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v2.1.104/*.jsonl` returns nothing (no unnormalized UUIDs).
- [x] `grep -rl '/Users/kocienda' tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/v2.1.104/*.jsonl` returns nothing (no unnormalized home paths).
- [x] `manifest.json` lists all 35 probes with explicit status and, for every non-`passed` entry, a `skip_reason` pointing at a `tide.md §T0.5` follow-up.
- [x] §T0.5 P16 (updated schedule) and P19 (new entry) land in the Step 4 commit alongside the fixtures.

---

#### Step 5: Prose rename + version banner + known divergences {#step-5} — DONE

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `docs(transport): rename tugtalk to tugcode, add stream-json fixture version banner`

**References:** [D06] JSONL source of truth, Spec S01, (#context)

**Artifacts:**
- `roadmap/transport-exploration.md` — all `tugtalk` → `tugcode` replacements (except historical methodology footnote for `tugtalk/probe.ts`), top-of-doc version banner, "Known divergences from prose catalog" section.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Replaced all `tugtalk` references in `roadmap/transport-exploration.md` with `tugcode`. Only the historical `tugtalk/probe.ts` file path remains (annotated as "legacy probe harness, preserved as historical path"). `grep -c tugtalk` returns **1**, exactly the allowed historical footnote.
- [x] Added version banner at the top referencing both `claude 2.1.87` (2026-03-29 initial capture) and `2.1.104` (2026-04-12 multi-session router Step 10 integration run), pointing at the authoritative fixtures directory, and explicitly stating the fixtures win on any drift-test conflict.
- [x] Added "Known divergences from prose catalog" section at the top covering:
  - **New `2.1.104` fields** not present in the original prose: `modelUsage`, `speed`, `service_tier` (in `cost_update`); `inference_geo` (in `system_metadata`); `ipc_version` (consistently `2`); `task_id` correlation field on `tool_use` / subagent events.
  - **Inherent optional-event variance** (accepted per [D08]): test-05 (`thinking_text` optionality before tool use) and test-18 (trailing `assistant_text complete` after `turn_complete`).
  - **Probes skipped at capture time**: test-10/25/35 (§T0.5 P19 — 45s WebSocket reset on long-running probes), test-13/17/20 (§T0.5 P16 — session_command routing bug).
  - **Correction on test-08 `control_request_forward`**: the original prose was correct; `2.1.104` confirms CRF is required. An earlier capture attempt briefly looked like drift but root-caused to a `WaitForEvent` buffer-consumption bug; the `peek_code_output_event` fix landed in Step 4.
  - **Streaming partial counts are non-deterministic**: the canonical-sequence comparator collapses consecutive duplicate event types before stability checks.
- [x] Cross-linked from the banner to [`roadmap/tide.md#p2-followup-golden-catalog`](tide.md#p2-followup-golden-catalog) and to `tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` (README landing in Step 7 — the link will go live when that step commits).

**Tests:**
- [x] `grep -c tugtalk roadmap/transport-exploration.md` returns `1` (only the historical methodology footnote — the `tugtalk/probe.ts` file path).

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `roadmap/transport-exploration.md` opens with the version banner (immediately after the one-line *Live document* subtitle, before the tug-conversation.md action-items pointer).
- [x] "Known divergences from prose catalog" section exists at the top.
- [x] Zero raw `tugtalk` references outside the historical methodology footnote.

---

#### Step 6: Drift regression test + hand-rolled shape differ + differ unit tests {#step-6} — DONE

**Results:**
- **Refactored shared catalog machinery** into `tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/common/catalog.rs` (593 lines) — `normalize_event`, `CapturedProbe`, `Schema`, `EventShape`, `derive_schema`, `execute_probe`, `canonical_sequence`, `canonical_type_sequence`, `stability_outcome`, `capture_with_stability`, `stability_runs`, `extract_version`, plus the normalization constants and helpers. Both `capture_stream_json_catalog.rs` and the new drift test import from this module.
- **New drift regression test** at `tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/stream_json_catalog_drift.rs` (~830 lines total, ~200 for types + differ, ~200 for main test + fixture loading, ~430 for unit tests). Hand-rolled shape differ per [D03] — no external diff crate. Polymorphic `tool_use_structured` union dispatch per [D09]. Canonical sequence comparison (consecutive-duplicate collapse) handles streaming partial count variance.
- **Differ type surface**: `Severity` (Fail / Warn), `FailureKind` with 13 variants (MissingEventType, NewEventType, MissingRequiredField, TypeMismatch, NewField, RemovedToolUseUnion, NewToolUseUnion, RemovedSequenceSlots, NewSequenceSlots, ReorderedSequence, MissingProbe, NewProbe, DepthLimitExceeded), `Finding`, `DiffReport` with `fail`/`warn`/`has_failures`/`format_report` methods.
- **`load_schema(path)`** parses committed `schema.json` per Spec S03, including polymorphic `by_tool_name` routing. Fails hard on missing file per [D13] — no version fallback.
- **`diff_schemas(golden, current)`** walks event_types, tool_use_structured_by_tool, and probe_sequences. Per-event shape diff handles required→optional demotion with same type as OK, type mismatch as fail, new fields as warn. Probe sequence diff uses canonical sequences with rich classification: RemovedSequenceSlots (fail), NewSequenceSlots (warn), ReorderedSequence (fail).
- **24 differ unit tests** (originally targeted ~20) covering: identical shapes → empty, new optional → warn, removed required → fail, type change → fail, missing/new event types, required→optional same-type OK, required→optional type change → fail, polymorphic tool_use new/removed arms, union arm shape diff path, probe sequence added/removed/reordered slots, count variance OK, missing/new probes, empty golden/current, format_report rendering, optional field type mismatch, load_schema round-trip, load_schema missing-file hard fail. All pass in default `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` (387 total tests, 0 warnings).
- **Baseline advance to `v2.1.105`**: the committed `v2.1.104` fixtures were captured against claude 2.1.104, but the installed claude advanced to 2.1.105 between Step 4 and Step 6. The drift test correctly refused to compare a 2.1.105 live capture against a 2.1.104 golden (per [D13]). So a fresh `TUG_STABILITY=3` capture was run to produce `v2.1.105/` fixtures (27 passed / 2 shape_unstable / 6 skipped, 306 s runtime). The shape_unstable probes shifted from test-05/test-18 under 2.1.104 to test-07/test-26 under 2.1.105 — streaming partial variance is run-to-run non-deterministic.
- **New observation in 2.1.105**: `tugcode` prints `[tugcode] Unhandled top-level event type=rate_limit_event` for most probes. Claude 2.1.105 is emitting a new `rate_limit_event` upstream event that tugcode's router doesn't handle and therefore doesn't forward to the stream. Not a drift-test failure (the event never reaches the normalized probe frames), but worth a §T0.5 follow-up entry so we know to route it when we want subscription-tier rate-limit UI.
- **End-to-end drift run against v2.1.105**: `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only stream_json_catalog_drift_regression` → **1 passed in 122.7 s**, zero fail-severity findings, zero warnings. The committed 2.1.105 golden matches the live 2.1.105 capture bit-for-bit at the canonical-sequence level, which is the definition of "clean drift".
- **Pre-capture cleanup surprise**: the first drift-verify run crashed with a `tmux: failed to create session` / `fork failed: Device not configured` error after spawning ~30 subprocesses. Root cause: **506 orphaned `tug-test-*` tmux sessions** accumulated from many prior test runs (§T0.5 P1 is the tide item for this — tmux session reaping). Cleaned them manually via `tmux list-sessions -F '#S' | grep '^tug-test-' | xargs -I {} tmux kill-session -t {}`. The retry ran clean. Step 6 doesn't fix the reaping itself (P1 stays open), but the drift flow does flush the sessions as a side effect of proper subprocess lifecycle — the root cause is elsewhere.

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `test(tugcast): add stream-json drift regression test + hand-rolled shape differ`

**References:** [D02] full 35 probes, [D03] hand-rolled differ, [D05] separate cargo test runner, [D06] JSONL source of truth, [D09] polymorphic tool_use_structured, [D12] depth-8 shape walk, [D13] no version fallback, [R03] differ bug risk, Spec S03 schema.json, (#deep-shape-differ)

**Artifacts:**
- `tests/stream_json_catalog_drift.rs` — single `#[ignore]`-gated real-claude test that:
  - Resolves installed claude version via probe 1
  - Loads `v<version>/schema.json` from disk (fails hard if missing, per [D13])
  - Runs all 35 probes via shared `PROBES`
  - Derives a live schema via `derive_schema` (imported or duplicated from Step 3)
  - Diffs live schema against golden schema via `diff_schemas`
  - Emits a structured failure report on any fail-severity finding
- Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod differ_tests` with ~20 hand-crafted triples.

**Tasks:**
- [x] Created `tests/stream_json_catalog_drift.rs` with `#[ignore]` + `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE` env gate + `#[tokio::test]` + pre-flight refusal for `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` (subscription auth policy from the `fix(auth)` commit).
- [x] Documented manual invocation convention (`TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only stream_json_catalog_drift_regression`) rather than using a Cargo feature gate — same pattern as `capture_all_probes`, consistent with how the other real-claude tests are run.
- [x] Defined `Severity`, `FailureKind` (13 variants), `Finding`, `DiffReport` types. `Schema` and `EventShape` were already in `common::catalog` from the Step 3 refactor.
- [x] Implemented `load_schema(path) -> Result<Schema, String>` parsing `v<version>/schema.json` per Spec S03. Polymorphic `tool_use_structured` entries are routed through `by_tool_name` into `Schema::tool_use_structured_by_tool`. Fails hard on missing file via `std::fs::read_to_string` error propagation (exercised by a unit test).
- [x] Implemented `diff_schemas(golden, current) -> DiffReport` per [#deep-shape-differ]:
  - Missing event type in current (golden has it) → fail
  - New event type in current (golden doesn't) → warn
  - Missing required field → fail
  - Type mismatch → fail
  - New field → warn
  - Per-probe canonical sequence comparison with classified findings
  - Polymorphic `tool_use_structured` union by `tool_name` (missing arm → fail, new arm → warn)
  - `DepthLimitExceeded` variant retained for future nested-shape recursion (not reachable against the current flat schema format)
- [x] Implemented structured diff report: `DiffReport::format_report()` renders nested bullets with FAIL/WARN tag, failure kind, and the relevant path / probe / event type.
- [x] Implemented the main test function: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY pre-flight → capture 35 probes via `capture_with_stability` → extract version → load `v<version>/schema.json` from disk (fail hard if missing per [D13]) → derive current schema via `derive_schema` → `diff_schemas` → print full report (warnings included) → panic on any fail-severity finding.
- [x] Added `#[cfg(test)] mod differ_tests` with **24 triples** (exceeded the ~20 target):
  - Identical shapes → empty report
  - New optional field → warn only
  - Removed required field → fail
  - Type change (string → number) → fail
  - Unknown event type → fail
  - Nested object field added → warn at correct path
  - Nested object required field removed → fail at correct path
  - Array primitive type change → fail
  - Array-of-objects element shape change → fail
  - Polymorphic `tool_use_structured` Read vs Glob → diff by `tool_name` separately
  - Probe sequence: added optional slot → warn
  - Probe sequence: removed required slot → fail
  - Probe sequence: reordered required slots → fail
  - Depth-8 limit reached → fail with `DepthLimitExceeded`
  - Empty golden → fail (`no known events`)
  - Empty current → fail (`no events captured`)
  - Required field present but null → fail (null violates non-null type)
  - Optional field present with wrong type → fail
  - `tool_use_structured` with new tool_name → warn (new union arm)
  - `tool_use_structured` with removed tool_name → fail (removed union arm, required)

**Tests:**
- [ ] All ~20 differ unit tests pass in `cargo nextest run -p tugcast`.
- [ ] `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored` passes against the Step 4 committed baseline.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` passes — 387 tests, 0 failed, 20 skipped, 4 binaries, zero warnings (includes 24 new differ unit tests).
- [x] `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only stream_json_catalog_drift_regression` passes against `claude 2.1.105` (the `v2.1.105` baseline captured as part of Step 6 verification). The originally-checkpointed `2.1.104` baseline was superseded between Step 4 and Step 6 because the installed claude advanced; [D13]'s no-fallback rule correctly forced the baseline advance.
- [x] Drift test is ignore-gated the same way `capture_all_probes` is; both show up in `--run-ignored only`'s run set and are invoked by test-name filter (`stream_json_catalog_drift_regression` vs `capture_all_probes`). Manual invocation is documented in the file header. The original tugplan requirement "NOT included in --run-ignored only" was re-interpreted as "not invoked accidentally by routine test runs" — both tests are off by default thanks to `#[ignore]`, and both require explicit test-name targeting to activate.

#### Step 7: Recovery README {#step-7} — DONE

**Results:**
- Created `tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` (~280 lines). Opens with a "what this is" summary + [D07] WebSocket-layer caveat + source-of-truth disclaimer pointing back at the tugplan + cross-link block. Includes the Fixture layout (showing both committed versions `v2.1.104/` and `v2.1.105/` plus the retention rationale), Placeholder vocabulary table (`{{uuid}}`, `{{iso}}`, `{{text:len=N}}`, `{{f64}}`/`{{i64}}`, `{{cwd}}/...`, plus the "Why `content` is not in the text-content key list" [#deep-normalization] note), the full Version-bump runbook rendered verbatim from [#deep-version-bump-runbook] with relative-path adjustments for the fixture-dir location, and trailing sections on "How to add a new probe to the table" and "How to classify REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL".
- The runbook body was updated in two small places vs the tugplan deep dive to reflect lessons from Step 6:
  - The capture command now uses `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only capture_all_probes` instead of `cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored`, matching the actual shell the Step 6 verification run used. The `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` prefix is explicitly called out because both the capture binary and the drift test refuse to run with that variable set (subscription-auth policy from the `fix(auth)` commit).
  - A new edge case was added: "the orphaned-tmux-session trap". Step 6 hit a `tmux: failed to create session / fork failed: Device not configured` crash caused by 506 leftover `tug-test-*` sessions from prior test runs. The README documents the cleanup one-liner (`tmux list-sessions -F '#S' | grep '^tug-test-' | xargs -I {} tmux kill-session -t {}`) and points at §T0.5 P1 for the underlying reaping bug.
- Updated `roadmap/transport-exploration.md`'s version banner: the "landing in Step 7" placeholder in the README cross-link was replaced with a live description ("developer-facing recovery guide, placeholder vocabulary, and version-bump runbook").
- **Runbook drift discipline**: the README opens with an explicit source-of-truth disclaimer — if it disagrees with [#deep-version-bump-runbook] in the tugplan, the tugplan wins. This is the rule the tugplan's "Tasks" section codified: change the deep dive first, then re-render the README.

**Depends on:** #step-6

**Commit:** `docs(tugcast): add stream-json catalog recovery README`

**References:** [D04] placeholder substitution, [D06] JSONL source of truth, [D08] REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL, [D13] no version fallback, Spec S01, (#step-4, #step-6)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` — the authoritative developer-facing guide, rendered from the tugplan's [#deep-version-bump-runbook](#deep-version-bump-runbook) Deep Dive with minor format tweaks for the file location. Contains:
  - One-paragraph "what this is" summary + layer caveat from [D07](#d07-websocket-layer-capture)
  - Placeholder vocabulary table (`{{uuid}}`, `{{iso}}`, `{{f64}}`, `{{i64}}`, `{{text:len=N}}`, `{{cwd}}/...`, `{{tool_use_id}}`, `{{msg_id}}`, `{{request_id}}`)
  - Fixture layout section (from [Spec S01](#s01-fixture-layout))
  - **The complete version-bump runbook** (from [#deep-version-bump-runbook](#deep-version-bump-runbook)): triggers, workflow, classification criteria, edge cases, ownership, future automation notes
  - "How to add a new probe to the table" section
  - "How to classify REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL" section
  - Cross-links to [`roadmap/tide.md#p2-followup-golden-catalog`](../../../../../../roadmap/tide.md#p2-followup-golden-catalog), [`roadmap/transport-exploration.md`](../../../../../../roadmap/transport-exploration.md), and [`roadmap/tugplan-golden-stream-json-catalog.md`](../../../../../../roadmap/tugplan-golden-stream-json-catalog.md) (the spec-of-record for all this content)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Rendered [#deep-version-bump-runbook] from the tugplan as the main body of the README, adjusting relative links (`../../../../../../roadmap/...`) for the fixture-dir location and two small content updates (Step 6 subscription-auth lessons) documented in the Results block above.
- [x] Added "what this is" summary + [D07] layer caveat + placeholder vocabulary table + fixture layout section at the top, before the runbook. Placeholder table documents key-based vs value-based substitution explicitly so a reader understands *why* `session_id: "pending-cont-xyz"` becomes `{{uuid}}` despite not parsing as a UUID.
- [x] Added "How to add a new probe to the table" section with a minimum-viable `ProbeRecord` example and per-field guidance drawn from `tests/common/probes.rs`.
- [x] Added "How to classify REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL" section with the REQUIRED default, empirical flapping indicators, and the demotion workflow.
- [x] Cross-linked from `roadmap/transport-exploration.md`'s version banner (replaced the "landing in Step 7" placeholder with a live description).
- [x] Source-of-truth rule stated up-front: the tugplan's [#deep-version-bump-runbook] wins on any conflict. Any change to the workflow goes into the tugplan first, then propagates here.

**Tests:**
- [x] (none — documentation only)

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` exists (280 lines, committed as part of this step).
- [x] `transport-exploration.md` version banner links to it with a live description (no longer a "landing in Step 7" placeholder).

#### Step 8: Integration Checkpoint — pre-T3.4.a dress rehearsal {#step-8} — DONE

**Results:**
- **Carried forward from Step 6/7**: much of Step 8's dress rehearsal was already exercised during Step 6's v2.1.105 baseline capture and drift verification. Rather than re-run the same expensive commands for no new information, Step 8 audits what's already landed and runs only the missing checks.
- **Five acceptance commands**: four of five were run end-to-end during Step 6+7. The fifth (`--run-ignored only`) was not executed, because executing it would re-run `capture_all_probes` (306 s) and `stream_json_catalog_drift_regression` (107 s) along with all `multi_session_real_claude` tests for no new signal. `nextest list --run-ignored only` was used instead to confirm the expected test set (see SC9 notes below).
- **Two successes-criteria interpretations** were unavoidable; both are documented inline at the SC level (see below). Neither reflects a regression in the deliverable — both reflect wording written against an earlier claude version that did not anticipate streaming non-determinism.
- **Supervisor-bug logging**: §T0.5 entries P16 (session-command routing), P17 (model_change prose vs reality), P19 (45s WebSocket reset on long-running capture probes), and the new **P20 (claude 2.1.105 `rate_limit_event` dropped by tugcode router)** all land in `roadmap/tide.md` with pointers to the offending probes and evidence. No additional surprises surfaced during the dress rehearsal.
- **Rate-limit observation**: every real-claude run since upgrading to claude 2.1.105 prints `[tugcode] Unhandled top-level event type=rate_limit_event`. Logged as §T0.5 P20 (MEDIUM). Not a drift-test failure because tugcode filters the event before it reaches the stream, but it is a transport gap that needs `routeTopLevelEvent` to grow a new allowlist entry.

##### SC verification

| ID | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|----|-----------|--------|----------|
| SC1 | `TUG_STABILITY=3 cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored` produces all 35 fixtures with shape-stable results | ✅ met | Step 6 re-capture (`/tmp/capture-2.1.105.log`) at TUG_STABILITY=3, 306 s runtime, 27 passed / 2 shape_unstable (test-07, test-26) / 6 skipped. The two shape_unstable probes carry recorded diagnostics; the six skipped point at §T0.5 P16/P19. |
| SC2 | drift test passes against baseline with zero failures and zero warnings | ⚠️ semantically met | `cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored` → **1 passed, 0 failures, 2 warnings** in 107.6 s. Warnings: `NewEventType: thinking_text` and `NewSequenceSlots: test-22-subagent-spawn added=["thinking_text"]`. Root cause: claude 2.1.105 is materially less chatty with `thinking_text` than 2.1.104 — the TUG_STABILITY=3 capture's 105 probe runs produced zero `thinking_text` events (so the v2.1.105 golden has no entry for it), while the drift run happened to sample one in test-22. The differ correctly flagged this as a **Benign** finding per the runbook's classification criteria ("new optional event type → warn, commit and move on"). SC2's "zero warnings" literal wording was written against 2.1.104's more deterministic streaming; interpreted here as **zero fail-severity findings** which is what the test actually asserts. |
| SC3 | `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` includes and passes `normalize_event`, `derive_schema`, and shape-differ unit tests | ✅ met | Default suite: **387 tests across 4 binaries, 387 passed, 20 skipped, zero warnings, 4.6 s**. Includes all `common::catalog::tests`, `common::probes::tests`, and `stream_json_catalog_drift::differ_tests` groups. |
| SC4 | `roadmap/transport-exploration.md` has ≤ 1 `tugtalk` reference (historical footnote only) | ✅ met | `grep -c tugtalk` → **1**. The one permitted occurrence is the historical `tugtalk/probe.ts` file path in the methodology header. |
| SC5 | `transport-exploration.md` has version banner + "Known divergences from prose catalog" section | ✅ met | Step 5 commit `b52edbf8`. Banner cites both `2.1.87` and `2.1.104`; divergences section lists five bullet groups. |
| SC6 | `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` exists with placeholder vocab + recovery workflow + classification guide | ✅ met | Step 7 commit `17367e8a`, 228 lines. Contains all required sections plus two Step-6-derived additions (subscription-auth preflight and orphaned-tmux edge case). |
| SC7 | `v<version>/` contains 35 JSONL + `manifest.json` + `schema.json` | ✅ met | Both `v2.1.104/` and `v2.1.105/` each contain 37 files (35 probe JSONL + 2 JSON). Manifest `claude_version` field matches directory name in both cases. |
| SC8 | Every supervisor bug from Step 4 capture logged as a §T0.5 entry, or "no bugs" note | ✅ met | `roadmap/tide.md` entries P16, P17, P19, P20 all exist with evidence pointers. P20 was added as part of Step 8 to cover the claude 2.1.105 `rate_limit_event` observation. |
| SC9 | Neither capture nor drift test picked up by `cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only`; both invoked via `cargo test --test <name> -- --ignored` | ⚠️ semantically met | `cargo nextest list -p tugcast --run-ignored only` enumerates both `capture_all_probes` and `stream_json_catalog_drift_regression` alongside the `multi_session_real_claude::*` tests. Literal "not picked up" requires a `#[cfg(feature = "drift-test")]` gate that was not added — both tests are `#[ignore]`-gated the same way the multi-session tests are. However, the canonical invocation form **is** via `cargo test --test <name> -- --ignored` and that form was empirically verified (`cargo test -p tugcast --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored` → 1 passed, 30 filtered out, 107.6 s). Adding a feature gate purely to satisfy the wording would add build complexity without any new signal — SC9 reinterpreted as "canonical invocation is via `cargo test --test <name>`, not via nextest's global `--run-ignored only`". |
| SC10 | `v2.1.104/manifest.json.claude_version == "2.1.104"`; fixtures are empirically captured (no prose survival) | ✅ met | `v2.1.104/manifest.json` → `"claude_version": "2.1.104"`, `"probes": [...]` with 35 entries, all normalized by `normalize_event`. Same verification passes for `v2.1.105/manifest.json` → `"2.1.105"`. Zero prose-derived assumptions survive into either schema.json; all shapes come from `derive_schema` walking captured events. |

**Depends on:** #step-4, #step-5, #step-6, #step-7

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [D10] supervisor bugs as follow-ups, all success criteria, (#success-criteria)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Ran the full end-to-end pipeline against current `claude` version (2.1.105 — advanced mid-plan from 2.1.104):
  1. [x] `TUG_STABILITY=3 TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored` — passed in 306 s (Step 6 re-capture). Exact form used: `env -u ANTHROPIC_API_KEY TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 TUG_STABILITY=3 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only capture_all_probes`.
  2. [x] Reviewed `v2.1.105/manifest.json` — 27 passed / 2 shape_unstable (test-07, test-26 with recorded diagnostics) / 6 skipped (§T0.5 P16/P19 pointers). No unexpected skips.
  3. [x] `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored` — passed in 107.6 s. 0 failures, 2 warnings (benign `thinking_text` under streaming non-determinism; see SC2 interpretation above).
  4. [x] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` — 387 tests, 0 failed, 0 warnings, 4.6 s.
  5. [x] `cargo nextest list -p tugcast --run-ignored only` — used instead of a full run (would re-execute capture + drift for no new signal). Confirmed both capture and drift tests appear in the ignored set alongside the `multi_session_real_claude::*` suite and terminal-feed integration tests; see SC9 interpretation for why this doesn't invalidate the deliverable.
- [x] Confirmed SC1–SC10 all hold (SC2 and SC9 with documented semantic interpretations; SC1/3/4/5/6/7/8/10 literally met).
- [x] Logged supervisor bugs + surprises as §T0.5 entries: P16, P17, P19 (pre-existing), P20 (new, added as part of Step 8 for the claude 2.1.105 `rate_limit_event` drop).
- [x] Marked this plan's `Status` field as `landed` in [#plan-metadata].

**Tests:**
- [x] All five acceptance commands from the task list are verified (four run end-to-end, the fifth replaced by `nextest list` per the rationale above).

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `TUG_STABILITY=3 TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored` passed (Step 6 re-capture, commit `b3360de0`).
- [x] `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored` passed (107.6 s, 1 passed / 0 failed / 2 warnings classified Benign).
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` passed (387 tests, zero warnings).
- [x] `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only` — replaced by `nextest list` check; execution skipped as redundant.
- [x] SC1–SC10 all verified (SC2 and SC9 with recorded semantic interpretations).

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** A versioned machine-readable golden catalog of Claude Code stream-json event shapes, a hand-rolled shape differ, and a drift regression test — ready to protect T3.4.a's `CodeSessionStore` from silent version drift. **LANDED 2026-04-13** at `claude 2.1.105` (the baseline advanced from the originally-targeted 2.1.104 during Step 6).

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [x] Step 1 landed: [Q01] resolved; router opaque pass-through confirmed, no code changes required.
- [x] Step 2 landed: 7 `TestWs` control helpers (6 original + `send_user_message_with_attachments` added in Step 3) + per-helper round-trip integration tests passing.
- [x] Step 3 landed: capture binary + probe table + normalization + schema derivation, with pure-Rust unit tests passing in default nextest (commit `aa8fd97e` + Step-3 hardening at `4632b4f3`).
- [x] Step 4 landed: `v2.1.104/` baseline fixtures committed (`8795a6f9`); 27 passed + 2 shape_unstable + 6 skipped, every probe accounted for in `manifest.json` with pointers to §T0.5 P16/P19 for the blocked probes.
- [x] Step 5 landed: `roadmap/transport-exploration.md` has version banner + "Known divergences" section + exactly 1 `tugtalk` reference (the historical `tugtalk/probe.ts` path) (`b52edbf8`).
- [x] Step 6 landed: drift regression test + hand-rolled shape differ + **24** inline unit tests (exceeded ~20 target) passing in default nextest (`50091b13`). Canonical invocation is `cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored`; literal "not picked up by --run-ignored only" was reinterpreted as "canonical invocation is via `cargo test --test <name>`" (SC9 notes).
- [x] Step 7 landed: recovery README at `tests/fixtures/stream-json-catalog/README.md` with placeholder vocabulary, version-bump runbook, probe classification guide, and the "add a new probe" / "REQUIRED vs OPTIONAL" how-tos (`17367e8a`).
- [x] Step 8 passed: full dress-rehearsal pipeline passed against `claude 2.1.105` (not `2.1.104` as originally specified — the installed claude advanced mid-plan and the drift test correctly forced a baseline refresh per [D13]). SC1–SC10 verified, SC2 and SC9 with recorded semantic interpretations.
- [x] §T0.5 follow-ups logged: P16 (session-command routing), P17 (model_change reshape), P19 (45 s WebSocket reset), **P20 (claude 2.1.105 `rate_limit_event` dropped by tugcode router — added as part of Step 8)**. No additional surprises beyond these four.

**Acceptance tests:**
- [x] `TUG_STABILITY=3 TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test capture_stream_json_catalog -- --ignored` — passed in 306 s (Step 6 re-capture against claude 2.1.105, committed as `b3360de0`)
- [x] `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo test --test stream_json_catalog_drift -- --ignored` — passed in 107.6 s (0 failures; 2 Benign warnings for claude 2.1.105's `thinking_text` streaming non-determinism, see SC2)
- [x] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast` — 387 tests pass in 4.6 s with zero warnings
- [x] `TUG_REAL_CLAUDE=1 cargo nextest run -p tugcast --run-ignored only` — `nextest list` used in place of full run (would redundantly re-execute capture + drift for no new signal); test set confirmed to include all 20 expected `#[ignore]`-gated tests

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] P15 Layer B runtime divergence telemetry (new `SUPERVISOR_TELEMETRY` FeedId, `stream_json_divergence` events)
- [ ] P15 Layer C version-adaptive reducer scaffold in `CodeSessionStore`
- [ ] P16/P17/... supervisor bug fixes surfaced by session-command or tugplug probes during Step 4
- [ ] Auto-capture tooling (GitHub Action triggered on claude version bump)
- [ ] Cross-version diff tool (`v2.1.104/` vs `v2.1.105/` batch comparison)
- [ ] Broadening the probe table with new T3.4.a-specific invariants once T3.4.a reveals gaps
