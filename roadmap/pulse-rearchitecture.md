## Pulse Rearchitecture — The Pulse Follows the Transcript, Not the Toolbelt {#pulse-rearchitecture}

**Purpose:** Rearchitect the session-overview emitter so the pulse headline follows *everything* that streams into a session's transcript — assistant prose, tool calls, and Session-card shell commands — on a clock-driven cadence, with an incremental prompt read that stops re-parsing multi-megabyte JSONLs on every tick.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

The pulse overview (`tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/session_overview.rs`) was built as a tool-telemetry summarizer when the feature it needs to be is a transcript follower. Its definition of "something happened" is `session_beat`, which recognizes exactly two frame types — `tool_use` (a digest line) and `turn_complete` (a bare counter tick) — so the assistant's own prose, the one place the session states its intent in natural language, never reaches the local model. The Session card's `$` shell route is invisible twice over: it runs on `SHELL_INPUT`/`SHELL_OUTPUT` (`feeds/shell.rs`), a wire the overview task never subscribes to, so a typed command contributes neither a digest line nor a cadence advance. And the emitter loop is purely frame-driven — the `select!` in `session_overview_task` has only cancel and `code_rx.recv()` arms, with `Cadence::fires` hard-returning `false` at `new_frames == 0` — so a stretch of pure prose can never fire, the 30-second idle path cannot rescue it, and the final stretch of every session goes unsummarized because no further frames arrive to trigger the check.

Two further defects compound this. The digest outvotes its own subject: a tick's "right now" section holds roughly `BURST_FRAMES` (8) lines against up to 32 background tool lines and 10 prompts, and the 2-bit 8B model is asked to headline the smallest section of its input. And the prompt read is unbounded: every tick calls `crate::scribe::session_prompts_since(&jsonl, 0, …)`, which `read_to_string`s and JSON-parses the entire session JSONL inline in the async loop — transcripts in this repo run to 51MB, and a faster clock-driven cadence makes this graduate from wasteful to unacceptable.

The prior liveness plan (`roadmap/local-model-liveness-completion.md`, landed on main) fixed the prompt's subject and gave the digest a recency split, and shipped the measurement layer this plan will be judged with: structured `local model request` lines from both transports, the `session overview: summarized` line with register-report fields, and `just model-stats` / `just model-liveness`. The measured baseline is a 44% headline change rate (87/199) on the pre-split build.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- One throughline applied at every seam: **the pulse follows the transcript, not the toolbelt.** The digest becomes a compressed transcript — prose, tool calls, and shell commands interleaved in arrival order — and everything the transcript shows advances the cadence.
- Widen `SessionBeat` into the unifying vocabulary (`Tool`, `Said`, `Shell`, `Turn`) rather than building a new activity-bus abstraction: the enum is the bus, and the wires behind it (two broadcast subscriptions) can multiply later without touching consumers.
- Give the emitter a clock: a tick arm in the `select!` sweeps sessions and evaluates cadence against elapsed time, so frame arrival becomes evidence accumulation instead of the trigger.
- Lower the cadence floors within the existing timeout ladder — liveliness is an essential element of the pulse — while keeping `SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT < EMIT_FLOOR` so the cadence stays designed rather than inference-bound.
- Fix the prompt read structurally (incremental tail reads with a per-session byte offset, off the async thread), not by tuning the full-file parse.
- Rebalance the digest by measurement, not intuition: candidate budgets go through the existing `tests/model-eval` harness with a corpus regenerated to the new compressed-transcript shape before any constant ships.
- Sequence pure-logic work first (beat vocabulary, accumulation, cadence) so every step lands with paused-clock `bun`-free Rust tests, and wire the app build + live verification at the end.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- A session doing pure assistant prose (zero `tool_use` frames) produces an overview within `IDLE_PERIOD` of the first prose beat — proven by a paused-clock Rust test that sends only `assistant_text` deltas and advances time (`cargo nextest run -p tugcast session_overview`).
- A session doing only `$` shell commands (zero CODE_OUTPUT beats) produces an overview — proven by a paused-clock Rust test that publishes only `exchange_started`/`exchange_complete` frames on the shell broadcast.
- The final stretch of a session is summarized with no trailing frame: a paused-clock test sends a burst, waits out the floor with zero further frames, and asserts an emit fired from the tick arm alone.
- The per-tick prompt read is incremental: a Rust test appends lines to a temp JSONL between reads and asserts the second read parses only the appended bytes (byte-offset observable via the cache struct), and the first prompt survives eviction.
- The regenerated model-eval corpus (compressed-transcript digests with `said:` and `$` lines) scores at parity or better with the current 12/12 register pass — `just model-eval` against the debug instance.
- Live headline change rate improves over the 44% (87/199) baseline — `just model-stats <instance>` after a real working session on the new build; the comparison is recorded in the dash round summary, not asserted by a test.
- `at0282-pulse-two-level.test.ts` still passes unchanged (`just app-test tests/app-test/at0282-pulse-two-level.test.ts`) — the PULSE frame contract (`overview_frame`) is untouched.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. Widen the beat vocabulary: `SessionBeat::{Tool, Said, Shell, Turn}` with an interleaved activity line per content-bearing beat (Spec S01).
2. Prose beats from live `assistant_text` deltas: per-block accumulation, early beat at a head threshold, keyed dedup against replay/reconnect snapshots (Spec S02).
3. Shell beats: subscribe the overview task to the `SHELL_OUTPUT` broadcast; `exchange_started` and `exchange_complete` both beat (Spec S01, [P03]).
4. Clock-driven emitter: tick arm, per-session cadence sweep, lowered floors (Spec S03, [P04], [P05]).
5. Incremental prompt cache: per-session byte offset, first-prompt retention, `spawn_blocking` reads (Spec S04, [P07]).
6. Digest rebalance: compressed-transcript layout, background clip, first + recent prompts, budgets validated through model-eval with a regenerated corpus (Spec S05, [P06]).

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Shell-command *classification* quality (`LocalModelPrompts.classify` and a classify eval register) — a follow-on plan; this plan's shell beats are the plumbing it will feed on.
- Deck-side rendering changes — the `overview_frame` wire shape (`kind: "overview"`) is unchanged and tugdeck is untouched.
- A generalized "session activity bus" — rejected in [P01]; the widened enum covers today's two wires.
- `thinking_text` beats — thinking is not what the session is *doing*, and the frame is not on `PULSE_FORWARD_ALLOWLIST` anyway; excluding it is deliberate.
- Rewriting `LocalModelPrompts.summarize` — the prompt stays frozen this plan unless the model-eval gate in Step 6 forces a wording touch ([Q02]).
- The dev-panel promotion of liveness numbers ([P07] of the prior plan's roadmap) and `NSLog`→`TugLog` migration — unrelated follow-ons.

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- The landed liveness plan's measurement layer: `session overview: summarized` tracing fields, `local model request` lines from `LocalModelService.handle`, `tests/model-eval/{run,analyze,liveness}.py`, `just model-stats` / `just model-liveness` / `just model-eval`.
- The `corpus_digests_are_what_compose_digest_produces` pin test in `session_overview.rs` and its `TUG_REGENERATE_DIGESTS=1` regeneration path.
- A resident local model on the test machine for Step 6's eval runs (`ternary-bonsai-8b-2bit`); the pure-logic steps need none.
- `tokio` `test-util` (already in tugcast dev-dependencies) for paused-clock tests.

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- Warnings are errors (`-D warnings` via `tugrust/.cargo/config.toml`).
- The timeout ladder must stay ordered: `CLASSIFY_SLOW(1s) < CLASSIFY_TIMEOUT(2s) < SUMMARIZE_SLOW(3s) < SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT(6s)`, and `SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT < EMIT_FLOOR` — the assert lives in `local_model.rs` against the `pub const EMIT_FLOOR`.
- The overview stays one-way ([D-series doctrine in the module header]): it taps broadcasts and produces only a PULSE frame and tracing; no client state reads, no request answering, no backpressure on any session.
- The emitter must cost nothing when it can't run: every missing precondition ends the tick silently.
- `LocalModelPrompts` strings are frozen by default; a change requires an explicit decision and eval evidence.
- The digest heading count is capped at three sections — a small quantized model given four or five headings starts answering about the headings (prior plan's finding).

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- `assistant_text` on the live path is a per-delta stream (`is_partial: true`, `text` = fragment) with **no** terminal `is_partial: false` frame at block end; terminal frames appear only on synthetic/replay/reconnect-snapshot paths (verified in `tugcode/src/session.ts` — deltas at the `text_delta` mapping, terminals only in synthetic emission, slash-command stdout echo, and the reconnect consolidated snapshot).
- `exchange_started` and `exchange_complete` SHELL_OUTPUT frames are self-contained: both carry `command`; complete also carries `exit_code`, `duration_ms` (verified in `feeds/shell.rs` — the settle frame repeats the command by design).
- `SessionScopedFeed::publish` splices `tug_session_id` into every SHELL_OUTPUT payload, so the overview can route shell frames by the same field it routes CODE_OUTPUT frames by.
- SHELL_OUTPUT carries no replay brackets — restore goes through CONTROL ledger reads, not feed replay (per the registration comment in `main.rs`) — so every shell frame the subscription sees is live work and needs no mute set.

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Final digest budgets (OPEN → resolved in Step 6) {#q01-digest-budgets}

**Question:** The exact values for the rebalanced digest — background activity lines, recent-prompt count, prose-line clip length.

**Why it matters:** These are model-facing proportions; guessed values are how the current imbalance shipped.

**Options (if known):** Starting candidates in Spec S05 (12 background lines, first + 2 recent prompts, 100-char prose clip).

**Plan to resolve:** Step 6 regenerates the corpus at candidate budgets and scores with `just model-eval`; the shipped constants are whatever scores at parity-or-better with the least input.

**Resolution:** OPEN — deliberately resolved by measurement inside this plan, not before it.

#### [Q02] Does `LocalModelPrompts.summarize` need a wording touch for the mixed-voice digest? (DEFERRED) {#q02-summarize-prompt}

**Question:** The digest gains `said:` and `$` line prefixes; does the frozen summarize prompt need to name them?

**Why it matters:** The frozen-prompt rule exists because prompt churn is the most expensive kind; but a model confused by `$` prefixes would tank the register.

**Plan to resolve:** Step 6's eval run is the gate: if the regenerated corpus scores at parity with the prompt unchanged, the prompt stays frozen. Only a measured regression reopens it, and then with the same A/B discipline the prior plan used (revert → rebuild → re-run on the same instance).

**Resolution:** DEFERRED to Step 6's checkpoint; default is no change.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Prose-beat flood inflates inference rate | med | med | one `Said` beat per text block, floor unchanged as hard spacing | `just model-stats` shows summarize call rate ≫ 1 per floor interval |
| Mixed-voice digest confuses the 2-bit model | high | med | Step 6 eval gate before constants ship; [Q02] fallback | register pass rate drops below current 12/12 |
| Tick sweep + inline `await` serializes multi-session emits | low | med | accepted: one shared model serializes inference anyway; note in code | a session's emit visibly starves another's |
| Reconnect-snapshot `assistant_text` double-counts prose | med | low | keyed dedup on `(msg_id, block_index)` (Spec S02) | duplicate `said:` lines in a digest |
| `exchange_complete` payloads are large (full `output` field) | low | low | parse only `type`/`command`/`exit_code`; never store output | overview task memory growth |

**Risk R01: Prose beats raise the inference bill** {#r01-prose-beat-flood}

- **Risk:** Counting prose as evidence makes busy sessions hit the burst threshold faster, increasing summarize calls.
- **Mitigation:** One beat per text block (not per delta); `EMIT_FLOOR` remains a hard minimum between inferences; back-off ladder unchanged.
- **Residual risk:** A long multi-block turn still ticks more often than today — that is the point (liveliness), and `just model-stats` watches the rate.

**Risk R02: The register degrades on compressed-transcript digests** {#r02-register-regression}

- **Risk:** `said:`/`$` prefixes are new vocabulary for a model whose prompt never mentions them.
- **Mitigation:** Corpus regeneration + `just model-eval` gate in Step 6 before budgets/wiring are declared done; [Q02] holds the prompt-touch escape hatch.
- **Residual risk:** The eval corpus is 12 entries; live drift beyond it is caught only by `just model-stats`.

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] The widened enum is the bus (DECIDED) {#p01-enum-is-the-bus}

**Decision:** `SessionBeat` grows to `Tool`, `Said`, `Shell`, `Turn`; no new activity-bus infrastructure is built.

**Rationale:**
- A dedicated bus would have exactly two publishers today; the enum unifies at the type level for free.
- Two subscriptions in one `select!` is idiomatic tokio and keeps the module's one-way doctrine intact.

**Implications:**
- `SessionState.tools` is renamed to an interleaved activity deque; every content-bearing beat appends one line.
- A future third wire adds a `select!` arm and a mapping function, nothing else.

#### [P02] Prose beats fire from accumulated deltas, once per block, early at the head (DECIDED) {#p02-prose-beats}

**Decision:** The overview accumulates live `assistant_text` deltas per `(msg_id, block_index)` and emits exactly one `Said` beat per block — as soon as the accumulated head crosses the prose-clip threshold (first sentence boundary or the char cap, whichever first), or at finalization for shorter blocks.

**Rationale:**
- The live wire has no terminal frame at block end; waiting for one would mean never beating (see #assumptions).
- Beating at the head threshold instead of block end is liveliness: the digest line only needs the block's opening, and the beat lands while the prose is still streaming.
- One beat per block keeps `new_frames` meaning "one narratable event," not "one network packet."

**Implications:**
- Per-session accumulation state with a seen-set for beaten keys; `is_partial: false` frames for an already-beaten key are dropped (reconnect-snapshot dedup).
- Finalization for short blocks: a delta for a *new* key finalizes the previous open key; `turn_complete` finalizes any open key.
- Accumulation stops at the cap — the tail of a long block is never buffered (bounded memory).

#### [P03] Both shell exchange frames beat; failure is the narratable completion (DECIDED) {#p03-shell-beats}

**Decision:** `exchange_started` always beats with a `$ <command>` line; `exchange_complete` always advances the cadence, and contributes a line only on nonzero exit (`$ <command> → exit N`).

**Rationale:**
- Liveliness is an essential element of the pulse (user direction): a command starting and a command settling are both transcript events.
- A zero-exit completion adds no information beyond its own started line; a failing command is highly narratable.

**Implications:**
- The complete frame is self-contained (carries `command`, `exit_code`) so no exchange-id→command map is needed.
- `shell_state`, `path_commands`, and any other SHELL_OUTPUT types are ignored.

#### [P04] The emitter runs on a clock; frames are evidence, not triggers (DECIDED) {#p04-clock-driven}

**Decision:** `session_overview_task` gains a `tokio::time::interval` tick arm; each tick sweeps `sessions` and evaluates `Cadence::fires` per session against real elapsed time. Frame arrival only accumulates state.

**Rationale:**
- Fixes lag (emits fire when due, not when the next frame happens by), freeze (prose-only stretches), and the never-summarized final stretch in one structural move.
- The paused-clock test infrastructure from the prior plan covers it directly.

**Implications:**
- `Cadence::fires`'s `new_frames == 0` guard changes meaning to "nothing new since last emit" — correct once prose and shell count as new.
- Multiple due sessions on one tick emit serially through the shared model; accepted per Risk table.
- The per-frame cadence check in the frame arm is removed — the tick is the sole evaluation point (2s granularity is well inside every floor).

#### [P05] Lower floors, ladder preserved (DECIDED) {#p05-cadence-numbers}

**Decision:** `EMIT_FLOOR` 15s → **8s**, `IDLE_PERIOD` 30s → **20s**, tick interval **2s**; `BURST_FRAMES` stays 8.

**Rationale:**
- Liveliness within reason (user direction); 8s keeps `SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT(6s) < EMIT_FLOOR` with margin so the cadence stays designed rather than inference-bound.
- The idle path matters more once prose beats exist; 20s makes a thinking-and-writing session refresh visibly.

**Implications:**
- The `local_model.rs` assert against `EMIT_FLOOR` still holds; no ladder edit.
- These are starting values; `just model-stats` turnaround data is the standing tuning input.

#### [P06] The digest is a compressed transcript (DECIDED) {#p06-compressed-transcript}

**Decision:** Activity lines interleave in arrival order — prose, tool, and shell lines in one stream — under the existing two activity headings; the prompt section becomes the session's first prompt plus its most recent ones.

**Rationale:**
- The pulse summarizes the *transcript* (user direction); a digest sectioned by line *kind* would re-impose the toolbelt framing this plan removes.
- The first prompt is the standing goal and the recent prompts are the live direction; the middle prompts are the least informative slice and currently outvote the subject.

**Implications:**
- `compose_digest`'s three-section shape and headings survive unchanged; only the line vocabulary and budgets move.
- Background is clipped at compose time so a long session cannot outvote its own present (Spec S05).

#### [P07] Prompts are read incrementally, off-thread, with the first prompt pinned (DECIDED) {#p07-incremental-prompts}

**Decision:** A per-session `PromptCache` holds a byte offset, the pinned first prompt, and a bounded deque of recent prompts; each tick stats the file, reads only appended bytes via `spawn_blocking`, and resets only if the file shrank.

**Rationale:**
- The full-file `read_to_string` + parse of a 51MB JSONL inline in the async loop is the plan's Gap E — a glaring hole, and the faster clock makes it worse.
- The first prompt never changes, so pinning it makes the Gap-D prompt shape (first + recent) free.

**Implications:**
- The parse offset only advances past complete lines (the JSONL's last line may be mid-write).
- `scribe.rs`'s per-line prompt-extraction logic is factored into a shared helper so the batch function and the incremental reader cannot drift.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### The three chokepoints, named {#chokepoints}

The tool-only behavior is enforced at three stacked points, and only two of them are wrong:

1. `forwardable_session` (`feeds/pulse.rs`) — the allowlist **passes** `assistant_text`; this gate is correct and untouched.
2. `session_beat` (`feeds/session_overview.rs`) — drops `assistant_text` one line after the allowlist admitted it. Widened by Step 1/2.
3. `SessionState::record` — only `Tool` beats contribute text. Widened by Step 1.

The shell route bypasses all three: it is a different broadcast entirely. Step 3 adds the subscription rather than routing shell frames through the CODE_OUTPUT tap — the one-way doctrine holds for both wires independently.

#### Live `assistant_text` semantics {#assistant-text-wire}

The critical wire fact (verified in `tugcode/src/session.ts`): live streaming emits `assistant_text { is_partial: true, text: <fragment> }` per delta, keyed `(msg_id, block_index)`, and **never** emits a terminal `is_partial: false` frame when a block completes. Terminal frames exist on exactly three paths: synthetic messages (slash-command output), replay, and the reconnect consolidated snapshot. Replay frames are already muted by the overview's bracket handling (`forwardable_session`'s `replay_started`/`replay_complete`); the reconnect snapshot is live and unmuted, which is why Spec S02's keyed dedup is load-bearing, not defensive.

`content_block_start` is not on `PULSE_FORWARD_ALLOWLIST`, so block boundaries are not directly observable; finalization is inferred (new key seen, or `turn_complete`). This is fine because [P02] beats at the head threshold anyway — finalization only matters for blocks shorter than the clip.

#### Why the shell subscription is cheap {#shell-subscription}

`SessionScopedFeed` (`feeds/session_scoped.rs`) exposes `subscribe()` and `sender()`; `shell_output_feed` is in scope at the overview wiring site in `main.rs` (the config block sits just above `register_session_feed(&shell_output_feed)`). The dispatcher's `emit` publishes through `SessionScopedFeed::publish`, which splices `tug_session_id` into the payload — so shell frames route by the same field as CODE_OUTPUT frames. `exchange_complete` carries the full command `output`; the overview parses only `type`, `command`, and `exit_code` and never retains the payload.

#### What the prior plan's instrumentation buys this one {#measurement-inheritance}

Every step here lands against a measurement surface that already exists: `session overview: summarized` logs `elapsed_ms`, `raw`, `headline`, and the three register-report flags; `just model-stats <instance>` computes headline change rate and turnaround percentiles from accumulated logs; `just model-liveness` is the smoke check; `just model-eval` scores register quality against the corpus. The 44% (87/199) change-rate baseline is on file from `release-main`. This plan adds no new instrumentation — it is the consumer the instrumentation was built for.

### Specification {#specification}

**Spec S01: Activity line vocabulary** {#s01-activity-lines}

One interleaved activity stream per session, each line from one beat, in arrival order:

| Beat | Source frame | Digest line | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| `Tool` | CODE_OUTPUT `tool_use` | `Name(target)` | unchanged from today (`tool_line`) |
| `Said` | CODE_OUTPUT `assistant_text` (accumulated) | `said: <head>` | head = first sentence or `MAX_SAID_CHARS`, whichever first; single line, whitespace-collapsed |
| `Shell` | SHELL_OUTPUT `exchange_started` | `$ <command>` | command clipped to `MAX_TARGET_CHARS` (60), matching tool targets |
| `Shell` | SHELL_OUTPUT `exchange_complete`, `exit_code != 0` | `$ <command> → exit N` | zero-exit completes beat (advance counters) with no line |
| `Turn` | CODE_OUTPUT `turn_complete` | — | counter advance only; also finalizes any open prose block |

`MAX_SAID_CHARS` starts at 100 ([Q01] tunes it). Sentence boundary = the first `.`, `!`, or `?` followed by whitespace/end, at index ≥ 20 (so "e.g." bait doesn't produce stub lines; a simple threshold, not a sentence parser).

**Spec S02: Prose accumulation state machine** {#s02-prose-accumulation}

Per session, alongside the activity deque:

- `open: Option<ProseBlock { key: (String, u64), text: String }>` — at most one open block; `beaten: HashSet<(String, u64)>` bounded by clearing on `turn_complete`.
- On `assistant_text { msg_id, block_index, is_partial: true, text }`:
  - key = `(msg_id, block_index)`; if key ∈ `beaten`, drop.
  - If `open` holds a *different* key: finalize it (emit `Said` if non-empty and not beaten), then open the new key.
  - Append fragment to `open.text` **only up to** `MAX_SAID_CHARS + slack` (no unbounded buffering); when the head first crosses the threshold (sentence or cap), emit the `Said` beat immediately, add key to `beaten`, keep the block open only as a key marker.
- On `assistant_text { is_partial: false }` (reconnect snapshot / synthetic): if key ∈ `beaten`, drop; else treat `text` as the whole block and beat once from its head.
- On `turn_complete`: finalize any open block, then clear `beaten` (msg ids never recur across turns) and record the `Turn` beat.

**Spec S03: Cadence semantics under the clock** {#s03-cadence}

- The `select!` gains `_ = tick.tick()` (interval 2s). The frame arm only records beats; the tick arm sweeps every `SessionState` and, for each where `Gates::allow()` and `Cadence::fires(new_beats, now - last_emit)`, runs the emit path (commit counters → digest → dedupe → summarize → register → PULSE).
- `Cadence` fields become `{ burst_beats: 8, idle_period: 20s, floor: 8s }`; `fires` keeps its shape: `new > 0 && since >= floor && (new >= burst || since >= idle)`. With prose and shell counting, `new == 0` now truly means "nothing happened."
- Back-off, gates, digest dedupe (`last_digest`), and headline dedupe (`last_headline`) are unchanged.
- Sweep order is map order; ties serialize through the one shared model (accepted, Risk table).

**Spec S04: PromptCache** {#s04-prompt-cache}

```rust
struct PromptCache {
    offset: u64,                    // bytes parsed so far (always at a line boundary)
    first: Option<String>,          // the session's first prompt, pinned
    recent: VecDeque<String>,       // last MAX_RECENT_PROMPTS prompts
}
```

- On each due tick: `std::fs::metadata(&jsonl)`; if `len == offset`, cache is current. If `len < offset` (rewritten file), reset the cache and re-read from 0. Else read `[offset, len)` in `spawn_blocking`, parse complete lines only, advance `offset` to the last `\n` consumed.
- Line parsing reuses the exact filter chain of `session_prompts_since` (`type == "user"`, `isMeta`/`isCompactSummary`/`permissionMode` exclusions, `user_submission_opens_turn`, `submission_text`), factored into a shared per-line helper in `scribe.rs` so the two readers cannot drift.
- Digest prompt set = `first` + up to `MAX_RECENT_PROMPTS` from `recent`, deduped when the first prompt is still among the recent ones.
- An unresolvable identity still costs only the prompts, never the tick.

**Spec S05: Digest layout and starting budgets** {#s05-digest-layout}

`compose_digest(prompts, activity, recent_count)` keeps its three sections and exact headings ("What the user asked for:" / "What the session has been doing:" / "What it is doing right now:"), empty sections omitted, both-empty → `None`. What changes:

| Budget | Today | Starting candidate ([Q01]) |
|--------|-------|---------------------------|
| activity deque cap (`MAX_TOOL_LINES` → `MAX_ACTIVITY_LINES`) | 40 | 24 |
| background lines in the digest (compose-time clip, newest kept) | up to 32 | 12 |
| prompts | last 10 × 240 chars | first + 2 recent × 240 chars |
| prose line clip (`MAX_SAID_CHARS`) | — | 100 |

The compose-time background clip is new: `tools[..split]` becomes the *last* 12 of the background slice, so a long session's ancient history drops out of the model's input entirely while the deque keeps enough for the next split.

| **Unit** | beat mapping, prose accumulation, cadence predicate, compose clipping, cache offset math | every pure function this plan touches |
| **Integration (paused clock)** | end-to-end emitter behavior over both broadcasts with `#[tokio::test(start_paused = true)]` | the success-criteria scenarios (prose-only, shell-only, trailing-stretch) |
| **Golden / Contract** | `corpus_digests_are_what_compose_digest_produces` pin; regenerated corpus | Step 6 |
| **Model eval** | `just model-eval` register scoring against the regenerated corpus | Step 6 gate |

#### What stays out of tests {#test-non-goals}

- New app-tests — the PULSE wire contract is unchanged, so `at0282-pulse-two-level.test.ts` already covers the deck path; a new app-test would re-test tugcast logic the paused-clock tests own. (App-test runs stay selective per repo policy.)
- Live-model latency assertions in Rust tests — turnaround is telemetry (`just model-stats`), not a unit-testable property.
- Fake-DOM / mock-store tests — banned repo-wide; nothing here is frontend anyway.

#### Step 1: Widen the beat vocabulary and interleave the activity stream {#step-1}

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-overview): widen SessionBeat to the transcript vocabulary`

**References:** [P01] enum is the bus, [P06] compressed transcript, Spec S01, (#chokepoints, #s01-activity-lines)

**Artifacts:**
- `SessionBeat::{Tool, Said, Shell, Turn}` with content-bearing variants carrying their pre-formatted line.
- `SessionState.tools` → `SessionState.activity` (interleaved deque, `MAX_ACTIVITY_LINES`); `tools_since_emit` → `activity_since_emit`.
- `SessionState::record` appends the line for any content-bearing beat; `Turn` stays counter-only.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the variants and rename the state fields; update `record`, the emit path's `tools`/`recent_tools` locals, and every test that constructs beats.
- [ ] Keep `session_beat`'s output for `tool_use`/`turn_complete` byte-identical (`tool_line` untouched) — this step changes the *container*, not the producers.
- [ ] Update the module header docblock: the overview follows the transcript (prose + tools + shell), not tool telemetry.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `record` interleaves `Tool`/`Said`/`Shell` lines in arrival order and evicts oldest at `MAX_ACTIVITY_LINES`.
- [ ] `Turn` advances counters without a line.
- [ ] Existing digest/cadence tests still pass under the renamed fields.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast session_overview`
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo build -p tugcast` (warnings are errors)

#### Step 2: Prose beats from live assistant_text deltas {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-overview): assistant prose is a first-class beat`

**References:** [P02] prose beats, Spec S01, Spec S02, Risk R01, (#assistant-text-wire)

**Artifacts:**
- Prose accumulation state on `SessionState` (`ProseBlock`, `beaten` set) per Spec S02.
- `assistant_text` handling in the frame arm: accumulate, beat at head threshold, keyed dedup, finalize on new key / `turn_complete`.
- `said:` line formatting (sentence-or-cap head extraction, whitespace collapse).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Extend the frame-arm dispatch: `session_beat` (or a widened successor) surfaces prose fragments with `(msg_id, block_index, is_partial, text)` so accumulation lives on `SessionState`, not in the parser.
- [ ] Implement the head-extraction helper (first sentence at index ≥ 20, else `MAX_SAID_CHARS` cap) as a pure `pub fn` for direct testing.
- [ ] Handle `is_partial: false` frames per Spec S02 (whole-block text, beaten-key drop) — this is the reconnect-snapshot dedup.
- [ ] Clear `beaten` and finalize open blocks on `turn_complete`.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Delta fragments accumulate and beat exactly once at the sentence boundary; further deltas for the key are dropped.
- [ ] A short block (never crossing the threshold) beats at finalization via a new key and via `turn_complete`.
- [ ] An `is_partial: false` snapshot for a beaten key produces no second beat; for an unseen key produces exactly one.
- [ ] Accumulation buffer never exceeds cap + slack (bounded even for a 10k-char block).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast session_overview`

#### Step 3: Shell beats — subscribe the overview to SHELL_OUTPUT {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-overview): the $ route reaches the pulse`

**References:** [P03] shell beats, Spec S01, (#shell-subscription)

**Artifacts:**
- `SessionOverviewConfig.shell_tx: broadcast::Sender<Frame>`; a `shell_rx` subscription and `select!` arm in `session_overview_task`.
- `shell_beat(payload) -> Option<SessionBeat>`: `exchange_started` → `Shell("$ cmd")`; `exchange_complete` → `Shell("$ cmd → exit N")` on nonzero exit, `Turn`-like counter beat on zero exit; everything else `None`.
- `main.rs` wiring: `shell_tx: shell_output_feed.sender()` in the overview config block.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the config field, subscription, and arm; shell frames route by the spliced `tug_session_id` and need no mute set (see #assumptions).
- [ ] Implement `shell_beat` parsing only `type`/`command`/`exit_code`; clip commands to `MAX_TARGET_CHARS`.
- [ ] Lagged/closed shell receiver mirrors the code receiver's handling (warn-and-continue / return).

**Tests:**
- [ ] `shell_beat` mapping table: started, complete-zero, complete-nonzero, `shell_state`, `path_commands`, missing fields.
- [ ] Paused-clock integration: a session publishing only shell frames reaches the cadence and emits an overview (extend the existing `TestHarness` with a shell sender).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast session_overview`
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo build -p tugcast`

#### Step 4: Clock-driven emitter and lowered cadence {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-1, #step-2, #step-3

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-overview): the emitter runs on a clock`

**References:** [P04] clock-driven, [P05] cadence numbers, Spec S03, (#s03-cadence)

**Artifacts:**
- Tick arm (2s interval) in `session_overview_task`; per-session cadence sweep; emit path moved out of the frame arm.
- `Cadence { burst_beats: 8, idle_period: 20s, floor: 8s }`; `EMIT_FLOOR` = 8s (still `pub`, ladder assert in `local_model.rs` still true).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `tokio::time::interval` with `MissedTickBehavior::Delay`; move the committed-tick path (counter reset → prompts → digest → dedupe → summarize → register → PULSE) into a sweep over due sessions.
- [ ] Remove the per-frame cadence evaluation; the frame arm ends at `state.record(beat)`.
- [ ] Update the cadence constants and every doc comment that states the old numbers; verify the `local_model.rs` `SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT < EMIT_FLOOR` assertion still compiles true.
- [ ] Keep the sweep resilient: one session's summarize failure back-offs globally exactly as today; the sweep continues next tick.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Paused clock: prose-only session (only `assistant_text` deltas) emits within `idle_period` — the frozen-headline freeze case, now impossible.
- [ ] Paused clock: a burst then silence — the tick arm fires the emit with zero trailing frames (the "final stretch" case).
- [ ] Paused clock: no beats at all → no emit ever (the `new == 0` guard).
- [ ] `Cadence::fires` unit table at the new numbers.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

#### Step 5: Incremental prompt cache {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-overview): incremental prompt reads with a pinned first prompt`

**References:** [P07] incremental prompts, Spec S04, (#s04-prompt-cache)

**Artifacts:**
- `PromptCache` per Spec S04, held per session by the overview task; `prompt_from_jsonl_line` factored in `scribe.rs` with `session_prompts_since` re-expressed over it.
- The emit path reads prompts via the cache in `spawn_blocking`; the `session_prompts_since(&jsonl, 0, …)` full read is gone from the loop.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Factor the per-line filter chain (`type == "user"`, meta/compact/permission exclusions, `user_submission_opens_turn`, `submission_text`, char clip) into `prompt_from_jsonl_line`; keep `session_prompts_since`'s behavior byte-identical (its existing tests are the guard).
- [ ] Implement the cache: stat → same-length short-circuit → shrink reset → append read from `offset` parsing complete lines only → pin `first`, rotate `recent`.
- [ ] Move the read off the async thread (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`); an I/O error costs the prompts, never the tick.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Temp-file test: write N lines, read; append M lines, read again — second read consumed only the appended bytes (offset assertion) and `first` is unchanged.
- [ ] Partial trailing line (no `\n`) is not consumed and parses correctly once completed by a later append.
- [ ] Shrunk file resets and re-reads; `first` re-pins.
- [ ] `session_prompts_since` regression tests still green over the factored helper.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast scribe session_overview`

#### Step 6: Digest rebalance, corpus regeneration, eval gate {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-5

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-overview): the digest reads as a compressed transcript`

**References:** [P06] compressed transcript, Spec S05, [Q01], [Q02], Risk R02, (#s05-digest-layout, #measurement-inheritance)

**Artifacts:**
- Compose-time background clip and the Spec S05 budgets; digest prompt set = pinned first + recent.
- Regenerated `tests/model-eval/corpus/*.digest.txt` (via `TUG_REGENERATE_DIGESTS=1 cargo nextest run corpus_digests`) after corpus JSONs gain representative `said:` and `$` lines in their `tools` arrays (the corpus format itself is unchanged — lines are just strings).
- A recorded eval result in the dash round summary settling [Q01] (final budget values) and [Q02] (prompt frozen or touched, with A/B evidence if touched).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement the compose-time background clip (last 12 of the background slice) and the prompt-set change; update `compose_digest` doc comments.
- [ ] Extend 3–4 corpus entries with interleaved `said:`/`$` lines mirroring real transcripts (match existing JSON formatting: indent=1, no trailing newline); add `investigate`-style verbs to `verbs.txt` only if the model earns them.
- [ ] Regenerate frozen digests; run `just model-eval <debug-instance>` at the candidate budgets; iterate budgets if the register regresses; only touch `LocalModelPrompts.summarize` under [Q02]'s A/B discipline.
- [ ] Record final constants and eval scores in the round summary.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `compose_digest` unit tests for the background clip, first+recent prompt layout, and section-omission invariants (empty sections still omitted; both-empty still `None`).
- [ ] `corpus_digests_are_what_compose_digest_produces` green against the regenerated corpus.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`
- [ ] `just model-eval <debug-instance>` — register pass rate ≥ the pre-plan 12/12 on the regenerated corpus

---

#### Step 7: Integration checkpoint — live transcript following {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-2, #step-3, #step-4, #step-5, #step-6

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** (#success-criteria, #measurement-inheritance), [P03], [P04]

**Tasks:**
- [ ] `just app-debug` from the worktree; confirm the instance via `just instances`.
- [ ] In the live Session card: run a `$` command and confirm a `$`-line-bearing digest and an overview emit in the logs (`just logs-debug`, `session overview: summarized`); hold a prose-only exchange and confirm an emit with a `said:` line and no `tool_use` in the window; let a session go quiet after a burst and confirm the trailing emit.
- [ ] `just model-liveness <debug-instance>` passes; `just model-stats <debug-instance>` after a real working stretch, recorded against the 44% baseline in the round summary.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `just app-test tests/app-test/at0282-pulse-two-level.test.ts` (regression; wire contract unchanged) plus whatever `just app-test-changed` selects for the diff.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run` (full workspace)
- [ ] `just app-test-changed` verdict PASS
- [ ] Live log evidence for the three scenarios above, quoted in the round summary

---

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** A pulse that follows the transcript: prose, tool calls, and shell commands all feed the digest and the cadence; the emitter fires on a clock with lower floors; the prompt read is incremental; and the rebalanced digest is validated through model-eval before it ships.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] Prose-only, shell-only, and trailing-stretch sessions all emit overviews (paused-clock tests + live log evidence).
- [ ] The emit loop performs no full-file JSONL reads (cache tests + code inspection: `session_prompts_since(_, 0, …)` absent from the loop).
- [ ] `just model-eval` register at parity or better on the regenerated compressed-transcript corpus.
- [ ] `EMIT_FLOOR` = 8s with the timeout-ladder assert still true; `at0282` green.
- [ ] Live `just model-stats` change-rate reading recorded against the 44% baseline.

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run` — full workspace green (modulo the known pre-existing `external_sessions` reference-session flake, which reads this conversation's own live transcript).
- [ ] `just app-test-changed` — VERDICT: PASS.

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] Shell-command classification quality: harvest real commands + verdicts from the accumulated `task=classify` log lines into a labeled corpus and add a classify register to model-eval — feeds on this plan's shell plumbing.
- [ ] Cadence tuning from a week of `just model-stats` data (the reason the analyzer exists); revisit `BURST_FRAMES` and the 2s tick if turnaround data argues.
- [ ] A third beat wire (e.g. composer bang-command routings) if the transcript vocabulary grows — the enum-is-the-bus decision keeps it a `select!` arm away.
- [ ] The prior plan's deferred items: dev-panel liveness numbers, `NSLog` → `TugLog` migration, the 56-char headline-budget question.

| Checkpoint | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| Transcript vocabulary lands | `cargo nextest run -p tugcast session_overview` |
