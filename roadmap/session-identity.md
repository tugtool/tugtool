## Session Identity Rollout — the dot, the name, and the two lines {#session-identity}

**Purpose:** Roll the Session Identity design spike out of the gallery card and into the app, so that every surface that names a session — the card masthead, the Lens Sessions rows, the new-session picker, the reference atom, and the flat-text citation — leads with a live pulsing dot, puts the user's own name first, and says what the session is doing in exactly two lines beneath it.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

Tug refers to a session five ways: a UUID, its 8-character short id, a minted `adjective-noun` callsign, a description written by the SharedAgent, and an optional user-provided name. An earlier pass consolidated the *plumbing* — one resolver (`tugdeck/src/lib/session-identity.ts`), one component family (`TugSessionIdentity`), a ledger-authoritative citation path — and a follow-up audit closed the bugs and doctrine drift in it. What that pass did **not** settle was the **content**: what each surface actually says, in what order, and with what mark in front of it.

The Session Identity gallery card (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/gallery-session-identity.tsx`) is where that was settled, over a review round that ran to a firm downselect. This plan carries those decisions into the real surfaces. Three of the decisions are structural rather than cosmetic and are why this is a plan rather than a patch: the session **icon retires in favor of a live phase dot** on every surface (which requires a session-keyed liveness door that does not exist yet); the **user's name leads the title** (which requires the resolver to stop merging the user's name and the agent's description into one `title` field); and the stack under the title drops from three levels to **two** (which retires the standing-intent line from chrome and takes the word `PULSE` out of user-facing ink entirely).

Two findings from the code survey make server work unavoidable, and both were confirmed against the source rather than assumed. First, the agent-written description is **frozen the moment a user renames a session** — enforced twice, in `record_synopsis`'s SQL and again ahead of the model call in `session_overview.rs`. Under the old design that was right (name and description competed for one line); under the new one they occupy different lines, and the freeze would leave every renamed session with a permanently dead description line. Second, the activity line's rest form promises a turn count and an on-disk size, but **both are scan-derived**: `turn_count` is refreshed only by the segmentation engine on a `list_sessions` scan, and `file_size` is documented in `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts` as absent on `session_updated` pushes and live rows. On the live card's own masthead — precisely where the design puts them — the size is usually missing and the count lags a turn behind.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **Data model first, surfaces last.** The resolver split ([P04]) and the liveness door ([P03]) land before any surface changes, so each surface change is a composition rather than a re-derivation.
- **Server before client where the client would otherwise render a lie.** The synopsis freeze ([P09]) and the turn-end freshness refresh ([P10]) ship first, so that when the masthead starts showing a description and a turn count they are real from the first frame.
- **One component, three mounts.** The masthead, the Lens row, and the picker row wear the same shape, so `TugSessionRow` grows that shape once ([P11]) and all three compose it. Nothing is hand-rolled at a mount site; the component library is the consistency mechanism, not a convention.
- **Retire, don't accumulate.** Each step that adds the new form removes the old one in the same commit — the icon, the intent line, the `PULSE` stand-in, the width control, the `title` field. A step that leaves both forms standing has not finished.
- **The gallery is the bench, so it moves last.** The identity app-tests drive the gallery card; the card's "shipped today, for contrast" frame becomes false the moment the component changes, so the card and the tests are reconciled in the same step as the component ([#step-5]) and the card is retitled to record what shipped at the end ([#step-11]).
- **Every step is independently green.** `cargo nextest run`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, `bunx vite build`, and a scoped `just app-test` selection at each checkpoint — never a full corpus sweep.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- A Session card's masthead shows three rows — `[dot] <title>  [wave]`, the description, and the activity line with its tape — with **no** width-control icon and **no** `project/` prefix on the title. The pane's own controls beside it are untouched: the slot-stack badge, the `…` section menu, and the close X all stay ([P15]). (Verify: app-test asserts `[data-slot="session-masthead"]` has exactly one dot and three text rows, and that no `[data-testid="tug-pane-title-bar-width-button"]` exists inside a masthead pane — an *absence* assertion, never an exact button list, which would go red the moment a Session card joins a stack and the badge appears.)
- A session with a user-set name renders `<name> : <callsign>` on the masthead, the Lens row, the picker row, and the atom; a session without one renders the bare callsign. (Verify: unit tests on the formatter `sessionTitleParts`; app-test reads the rendered runs on all four.)
- Under a width squeeze on a named session, the **callsign** is the run that ellipsizes and the user's name survives intact. (Verify: app-test measures `scrollWidth`/`clientWidth` on the two runs in a narrowed pane.)
- No surface renders the string `PULSE`. (Verify: a unit-test grep gate over `tugdeck/src/components/` and `tugdeck/src/lib/` asserting no user-facing `PULSE` literal outside gallery cards and internal identifiers.)
- The phase dot never paints danger for a session whose liveness is merely unknown. (Verify: unit test on `useSessionPhase`'s no-card fallback returning the `idle` key, plus an app-test on a picker row for a closed session.)
- A session renamed by the user still receives a rolling description. (Verify: Rust test that `record_synopsis` writes with `name_user_set = 1`.)
- Immediately after a turn completes, the masthead's activity line reports the post-turn turn count and a non-null size. (Verify: Rust test that the turn-end refresh writes both and that `build_session_updated_frame` carries `file_size`.)
- Copying a session atom — from a chip's right-click, from the masthead title's right-click, or from the telemetry popover — writes the same flavor set. (Verify: extend `tests/app-test/at0376-session-atom-clipboard.test.ts` to the masthead title path.)

#### Scope {#scope}

1. Rust: lift the synopsis freeze; refresh turn count and file size at turn end; carry `file_size` on the `session_updated` push.
2. Resolver: split `SessionIdentity.title` into `customName` and `description`; add the title-grammar formatter.
3. Liveness: add `useSessionPhase(sessionId)`; correct the unknown-liveness fallback from danger to idle; refactor `SessionPhaseDot` onto it.
4. `TugSessionIdentity`: dot-led mark, title grammar, text-ink atom, live phase, right-click copy, missing form without a slash.
5. `TugSessionRow`: absorb the title/description/activity shape with an optional tape.
6. The three surfaces: the masthead (rebuilt on the shared shape, width control removed, telemetry popover gains the atom), the Lens Sessions rows, the picker rows.
7. Banish user-facing `PULSE` ink.
8. Doctrine: amend `[D132]`; reconcile the gallery card and the identity app-tests.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Changing the citation's flat-text grammar, the commit trailer pair, or the clipboard flavor set. The atom's *face* changes; its *payloads* do not.
- Reviving the `text/html` clipboard flavor (struck in the earlier round and staying struck).
- Adding the short id to the atom's sidecar segment — see [Q01].
- Changing the Changes card's `session_row_title` in `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/changeset.rs` to the new grammar — see [Q02].
- The composer's pasted atom. It is a CodeMirror `AtomWidget` rendering a baked `<img>`, and it stays one — see [P14] for why that is a medium constraint rather than a styling choice. No step touches `atom-decoration.ts`.
- The `session_updated` push's clobber of `origin` and `terminal_live` (`normalizeSessionRow` defaults them, `patchRow` replaces the row wholesale). A real pre-existing bug in the same seam as [R06], deliberately not fixed here — see [#roadmap].
- Fork-lineage grammar, the `minted_tags` arbiter, or anything about how callsigns are minted.
- The `/resume <tag>` resolution path (still client-cache-backed while citations are ledger-authoritative) — untouched here.
- Any change to `sessionIdentityLine`'s output. It is the pane-title channel and is deliberately constant for the life of a binding; see [P05].

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- The Session Identity gallery card in its post-downselect state (`gallery-session-identity.tsx` / `.css`), which is the visual contract this plan implements.
- `tugcast`'s segmentation engine and incremental scan entry points, all already public in `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/external_sessions.rs`: `stat_size_mtime`, `resume_seed_from_cache`, `parse_candidate`, `engine_turn_count`.
- The ledger writers `reconcile_turn_count_from_engine` and `upsert_scan_cache` in `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/session_ledger.rs`.
- A Rust change requires `just build-app` before any app-test run — `app-test` refreshes `dist` but never rebuilds the app binary.

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- **Warnings are errors.** `tugrust/.cargo/config.toml` enforces `-D warnings`; both `cargo build` and `cargo nextest run` fail on any warning.
- **The masthead must not reflow.** Its slot height is a fixed token; every row truncates rather than wrapping. Chrome that changed height with its content would move every card beneath it.
- **`sessionIdentityLine` must stay constant for a binding.** The tab strip, the Window menu, and the slot-stack picker read it through the pane-title channel, which is not a notification path.
- **Picker cells are pure render functions** (no `useState`/`useRef`/`useEffect`), per the picker redesign's `[D17]`. Any new hook used there must be a pure subscription read.
- Laws in play: `[L02]` external state through `useSyncExternalStore` only; `[L06]`/`[L24]` appearance via CSS and DOM, never React state; `[L09]` the pane owns the chrome slot, this content owns what is in it; `[L13]` motion belongs to the animator/indicator; `[L19]` component authoring; `[L20]` token sovereignty; `[L26]` mount identity (the masthead is keyed by session).
- Ledger databases are never opened with a foreign `sqlite3`; use `just db-inspect` for any inspection.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The SharedAgent's Summarize lane can absorb the additional renamed-session traffic that lifting the freeze creates; the lane's existing debounce is the throttle. See [R01].
- A single-session incremental re-parse at turn end is cheap because the resume-seed path avoids a full re-stream on ordinary appends (`tuglaws/turn-metric.md`). See [R02].
- Every surface in scope already resolves identity through `useSessionIdentity`, so the `customName`/`description` split reaches them without new wiring.
- The theme's session-color tokens stay authored even though the atom stops painting from them; the dot's phase tones are the atom's color channel now.

### Reference and Anchor Conventions (MANDATORY) {#reference-conventions}

This plan uses explicit `{#anchor}` headings and rich `**References:**` lines. Plan-local decisions are `[P01]`…; `[D##]` refers to the global `tuglaws/design-decisions.md`. No step cites line numbers.

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Should the atom's sidecar segment carry the short id? (DEFERRED) {#q01-sidecar-short-id}

**Question:** `sessionAtomSegment` in `tugdeck/src/lib/session-atom.ts` builds an `AtomSegment` whose `label` and `value` are both `<project>/<callsign>` — the short id is absent. Should the segment carry the id so a pasted atom can re-resolve exactly rather than by callsign?

**Why it matters:** A callsign is permanent and unique, so today's payload is unambiguous. But an atom pasted into a document that outlives this ledger has no id to resolve against, while the flat-text citation beside it does.

**Options:**
- Add `sessionId` to the segment (widens the generic `AtomSegment` shape for one atom type).
- Encode it into `value` as the citation form (changes what the wire marker carries).
- Leave it — the callsign is already a unique permanent key.

**Plan to resolve:** Revisit when a second consumer of the sidecar needs exact resolution. Nothing in this rollout depends on it.

**Resolution:** DEFERRED — out of scope here; the atom's payloads are explicitly unchanged by this plan (see [#non-goals]).

**Answered by the ledger instead.** The consumer this question anticipated arrived — a live transcript chip needs an id to subscribe with — and the payload still did not have to widen: `resolve_sessions` resolves a callsign ([P14]'s amendment). The callsign was already "a unique permanent key"; what was missing was somewhere to redeem it. An atom pasted into a document that outlives this ledger is unchanged by that, and the flat-text citation beside it remains the durable form.

#### [Q02] Should the Changes card's session title adopt the new grammar? (DEFERRED) {#q02-changeset-title-grammar}

**Question:** `session_row_title` in `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/changeset.rs` composes a session's display title server-side with the old precedence — user name, else callsign, else prompt snippet, else short id. The new grammar is `<name> : <callsign>`, with both present.

**Why it matters:** The Changes card is a sixth surface naming sessions. Left alone it shows a *different* answer from the five surfaces in scope, which is the exact inconsistency this work exists to remove.

**Options:**
- Change `session_row_title` to the composed grammar now (adds a Rust surface and its tests to this plan).
- Leave it and file a follow-on.

**Plan to resolve:** Follow-on. The Changes card was not among the five surfaces named for this rollout, and the grammar change there is independent of everything here.

**Resolution:** DEFERRED — tracked in [#roadmap].

#### [Q03] Does the masthead keep the sparkline and activity-line popovers? (DECIDED) {#q03-masthead-popovers}

**Question:** The shipped masthead hangs two popovers off its third row: clicking the tape opens `SessionPulseCard`; clicking the activity run opens the recent-pulses history.

**Resolution:** DECIDED — both stay, unchanged. Neither is `PULSE` ink (the history popover's heading is "Recent pulses", and its intent groupings are where the retired standing-intent line survives per [P06]). Removing an existing affordance is not part of this rollout.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| R01 Summarize-lane token cost rises | med | high | Existing lane debounce; renamed sessions were previously exempt and now are not | Observable lane backlog or cost complaint |
| R02 Turn-end engine re-parse is slow | high | low | Reuse the incremental resume-seed path, never a naive full parse | A turn-end refresh visibly delays a `session_updated` push |
| R03 Masthead reflow / height drift | med | med | Fixed height token; every row truncates; app-test asserts the height is content-independent | Any masthead row wrapping |
| R04 `identity.title` rename fanout misses a caller | med | med | Remove the field entirely so the compiler finds every reader | `tsc` clean but a surface renders empty |
| R05 Identity app-tests assert the retired form | high | high | Update `at0374` in the same commit as the component | at0374 red after [#step-5] |
| R06 `session_updated` push clobbers a known `file_size` **or `turn_count`** | med | high | Every push looks both facts up from the scan cache, not just the turn-end one | Picker size or turn readout blanking after an unrelated push |

**Risk R02: Turn-end re-parse cost** {#r02-turn-end-parse-cost}

- **Risk:** Running `engine(file)` on every turn completion could re-stream a large JSONL each turn, adding latency to the turn-end push.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Compose the existing incremental path — read the scan-cache row, `resume_seed_from_cache`, then `parse_candidate` **with** that seed — which `tuglaws/turn-metric.md` certifies never re-streams in full on an ordinary append.
  - Do the work off the turn's critical path: the refresh runs after the turn-complete intercept has already forwarded the frame.
  - Skip entirely when `stat_size_mtime` reports the file unchanged since the cached `(file_size, file_mtime)`.
- **Residual risk:** A turn that lands a compaction or a history edit does force a full re-stream, by the engine's own rules. That is correct and rare.

**Risk R06: Push clobbering a known size or turn count** {#r06-push-clobbers-size}

- **Risk:** The client's `SessionLedgerStore.patchRow` **replaces the cached row wholesale** — `nextRows[existingIdx] = row` — so a push carries the whole row or downgrades what it omits. Two facts are at stake, not one:
  - **`file_size`** is optional on the wire and `normalizeSessionRow` maps a missing one to `null`. If only the turn-end push carries a size, every *other* `session_updated` push (a rename, a state change, a card bind) blanks the readout.
  - **`turn_count`** is the same hazard one layer down, and the codebase already knows it: the `list_sessions` merge path deliberately guards a **sparse phase-1 `0`** (the real count for that session lives in the scan cache and lands at phase 2), keeping the prior settle's count rather than flickering to "0 turns". `patchRow` has no such guard, and `build_session_updated_frame` reads `row.turn_count` straight off the `sessions` table — so a rename push for a session whose count only ever came from a scan knocks it to 0. [P08] is about to put that number on the masthead, which turns a latent picker wobble into a visible lie.
- **Mitigation:**
  - `build_session_updated_frame` reads **both** the scan-cache size and the scan-cache turn count for the row on **every** push — one lookup, both facts — so no push is a downgrade. Server-side, because that is the seam both facts already pass through; a second client-side guard would be a rule to keep in sync.
  - The lookup answers `None` when there is no scan-cache row, and the frame then falls back to `row.turn_count` for the count (the ledger's own value is right for a session the scanner has never seen) and to `null` for the size.
  - Unit tests assert a rename-triggered push still carries both.
- **Residual risk:** A session with no scan-cache row at all (never scanned, never had a turn) reports no size, which is honest — the activity grammar drops the segment ([S03]).
- **Adjacent, and out of scope:** the same wholesale replacement also resets `origin` to `"tug"` and `terminal_live` to `null` on every push, because `normalizeSessionRow` defaults them and pushes never carry them. That is a pre-existing bug with its own blast radius (the picker's `terminal` badge and its in-use rows), noted here so it is recognized rather than rediscovered mid-step. It is not fixed by this plan.

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] The pulsing dot is the session mark; the chatbox icon retires (DECIDED) {#p01-dot-is-the-mark}

**Decision:** Every surface that names a session leads with a live `TugProgressIndicator variant="pulsing-dot"` reading the session's phase. `MessageSquareText` / `MessageSquareOff` leave `TugSessionIdentity` entirely.

**Rationale:**
- One mark everywhere, and the mark is alive: it says what the session is *doing*, not merely what kind of thing it is.
- The icon and the dot were previously both present on rows, which spent two marks on one job.

**Implications:**
- The unresolvable citation loses its slashed-icon treatment and states failure by shape alone ([P13]).
- `at0374`'s icon-bearing assertions must change in the same commit as the component ([R05]).

#### [P02] Unknown liveness reads idle, never danger (DECIDED) {#p02-doubt-reads-idle}

**Decision:** Any session whose live state cannot be reached — no bound card, services not yet constructed, a closed or external row — renders the **idle** dot. Red is reserved for genuine failure (`errored`, and a dead transport under a live card).

**Rationale:**
- Red is the error channel; spending it on "we do not know" makes every ordinary closed session look broken.
- `SessionPhaseDot` currently falls back to `OFFLINE_PHASE_INPUT` (`transportState: "offline"`), which `sessionSessionPhaseVisual` maps to `{ role: "danger", state: "aborted" }`. Under [P01] the dot appears on far more surfaces than before, so this latent wrong reading would become widespread.

**Implications:**
- The no-card fallback becomes `{ phase: "idle", transportState: "online", interruptInFlight: false }`.
- A card that exists but whose transport is genuinely offline still reads danger — that is a real failure, not doubt.

#### [P03] One session-keyed liveness door: `useSessionPhase(sessionId)` (DECIDED) {#p03-use-session-phase}

**Decision:** Add `useSessionPhase(sessionId): string` to `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/use-session-phase.ts`, returning the flattened phase **key**. It resolves session → card via `useCardIdForSession`, card → services via `cardServicesStore`, services → snapshot via the card's `codeSessionStore`, and folds the snapshot through `sessionSessionPhaseKey`. `SessionPhaseDot` is refactored to consume it.

**Rationale:**
- Identity is session-keyed and liveness is card-keyed; the join has to happen somewhere, and doing it once is what lets an atom (which holds only a session id) show a live dot at all.
- The snapshot is the whole session state and wakes on every transcript event. Returning the *key* — a short string — means React bails out of the re-render unless the reading actually changed, which is what keeps the identity surfaces quiet.
- Liveness stays **out** of the identity record, exactly as `session-identity.ts` documents: two subscriptions, two keys, meeting in the component.

**Implications:**
- Every store read enters through `useSyncExternalStore` ([L02]).
- Hook rules forbid conditional calls, so the hook is always called and answers `"idle"` when there is nothing to read ([P02]).
- The picker's pure-renderer rule permits it: it is a subscription read with no local state.

#### [P04] `SessionIdentity.title` splits into `customName` and `description` (DECIDED) {#p04-identity-title-split}

**Decision:** Remove `title` from `SessionIdentity`. Add `customName: string | null` (the user's `/rename`, from `sessionNameStore`) and `description: string | null` (the agent's synopsis, from `sessionSynopsisStore`). They are never merged.

**Rationale:**
- The user's name and the agent's description now occupy *different lines* on every surface, so a field that merged them cannot serve either.
- Removing the field rather than deprecating it makes the compiler enumerate every reader ([R04]).

**Implications:**
- Known readers to update: `session-masthead.tsx`, `session-picker-cells.tsx`, `tug-session-identity.tsx` (the tooltip body), `components/lens/sections/cards-section.tsx`, `components/lens/sections/cards-data-source.ts`.
- `cards-section.tsx` uses `identity.title` for a close-button label and a filter-highlighted run; both take `customName ?? description ?? tag` explicitly at the call site rather than a revived merge.

#### [P05] The title grammar is `<customName> : <callsign>`, and the callsign gives way first (DECIDED) {#p05-title-grammar}

**Decision:** A named session's title renders the custom name in the title weight, then a quieter ` : <callsign>`. An unnamed session renders the bare callsign. Under a width squeeze the **callsign** truncates and the custom name survives. A new pure formatter `sessionTitleParts(identity): { name: string; callsign: string | null }` produces the two runs. `sessionIdentityLine` is **unchanged**.

**Rationale:**
- A user-supplied name is the user explicitly saying what the session is called; it cannot rank below a callsign Tug minted for itself.
- The callsign stays visible because it is the permanent citable handle that a rename never changes — and it is the run that can be sacrificed, because the tooltip and every copy path still carry it whole.
- `sessionIdentityLine` feeds the pane-title channel, which is not a notification path and is documented as constant for the life of a binding. Changing it would make the tab strip stale on rename; a separate formatter avoids that entirely.

**Implications:**
- Two runs in the DOM, not one — which is a deliberate departure from the shipped chip's one-text-node rule, and `at0374`'s node-counting assertion changes accordingly ([R05]).
- CSS: the name run is `flex: none` when a callsign follows it, and the callsign run carries `min-width: 0; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis`. When the name run stands alone it takes `min-width: 0` and may ellipsize, since it is then the only run there is.
- The masthead drops the `project/` prefix from its title ink; the prefix survives in the tooltip, the citation, and the telemetry popover.

#### [P06] Two levels under the title, not three (DECIDED) {#p06-two-levels}

**Decision:** The stack is title → description → activity. The standing-intent level (the `TugPulse` headline) leaves chrome on all three surfaces.

**Rationale:**
- The description already says what the session is for; a standing goal beside it is a second goal-shaped line reading as an echo.
- The intent is not lost: it survives in the recent-pulses popover, where it heads its run of beats ([Q03]).

**Implications:**
- The Lens row stops rendering `usePulseOverview`'s text as its middle line and renders the description instead.
- `TugPulse`'s `headline` prop stops being passed by the three surfaces. The component keeps it — the popover and other consumers still use it.

#### [P07] `PULSE` is an internal name and never user-facing ink (DECIDED) {#p07-pulse-is-internal}

**Decision:** No surface renders the string `PULSE`. Stores, modules, tests, and CSS class names keep the name; labels, legends, and stand-ins lose it.

**Rationale:**
- With the activity line always carrying something true to say ([S03]), nothing needs a placeholder word — and a band that names itself is furniture where a sentence belongs.

**Implications:**
- `HEADLINE_FALLBACK` in `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-pulse.tsx` (a `<span className="tug-pulse-headline-stand-in">PULSE</span>`) is removed; an absent headline renders no run. Its "keeps the line's height" job is obsolete because the surfaces no longer render a headline level at all ([P06]).
- A grep-gate unit test keeps it out, exempting gallery cards (which discuss the vocabulary) and non-ink identifiers.

#### [P08] The activity line's grammar (DECIDED) {#p08-activity-grammar}

**Decision:** At rest, the activity line reads `<turns> turns, <size>. Last updated: <stamp>. Ready.`; segments with no value drop out. During a turn it carries the live beat. See [S03] for the normative form.

**Rationale:**
- The row was previously a placeholder much of the time; these are facts the ledger already holds and a reader actually wants.
- `Last updated:` is labeled because a bare date-time beside a size and a turn count is ambiguous about which fact it dates.

**Implications:**
- The masthead needs `turn_count`, `file_size`, and `last_used_at` for its own session — hence [P10].
- The existing `restingActivityText` helper in `tugdeck/src/lib/pulse-line/resting-line.ts` composes a *different* sentence (`Completed at … Ready.`). The new grammar is a new formatter; the resting-line module stays for its own callers.

#### [P09] The synopsis freeze is lifted (DECIDED) {#p09-lift-synopsis-freeze}

**Decision:** Remove both enforcement points so the Summarize lane keeps describing renamed sessions: the `AND name_user_set = 0` clause in `SessionLedger::record_synopsis`, and the early return on `row.name_user_set` in `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/session_overview.rs`.

**Rationale:**
- The freeze existed because a generated line must not speak *over* the user's word. Under the new design they never compete — the name is the title, the description is the line beneath it.
- Without lifting it, every renamed session shows a permanently stale or empty description line, which is the most-used state on the most-visible surface.

**Implications:**
- Sessions renamed before this change fill their description in on their next activity; no migration is needed.
- The doc comments on both sites, and on `SessionRow.synopsis` in both `session_ledger.rs` and `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts`, must be rewritten — they currently *state* the freeze as the contract.
- The existing test asserting the freeze inverts to assert the write. See [R01] for cost.

#### [P10] Turn count and size refresh at turn end and ride every push (DECIDED) {#p10-turn-end-freshness}

**Decision:** On turn completion, tugcast re-derives `engine(file)` and the on-disk size for that session incrementally, writes both (`reconcile_turn_count_from_engine` + `upsert_scan_cache`), and broadcasts `session_updated`. `build_session_updated_frame` gains a `file_size` field and a scan-cache-sourced `turn_count`, both read on **every** push.

**Rationale:**
- The activity line's rest form is read the instant a turn ends, which is exactly when the old numbers were most stale.
- Sourcing both facts on every push rather than only the turn-end one avoids the clobber described in [R06].
- The engine is the single count authority (`tuglaws/turn-metric.md`); this reuses it rather than adding a second counter.

**Implications:**
- Composed from existing public entry points in `external_sessions.rs`: `stat_size_mtime` → skip if unchanged; else `resume_seed_from_cache` + `parse_candidate` for an incremental parse.
- **`build_session_updated_frame` needs a signature change, and it is the one piece of fanout in this step.** It is today a pure `pub fn(&SessionRow) -> Frame` with callers in `agent_supervisor.rs` (three, one of them a test) and one in `feeds/session_overview.rs`. It gains a second parameter — `metrics: Option<SessionScanMetrics>` carrying `(file_size, turn_count)` — rather than a `&SessionLedger` handle, so the function stays pure and its test stays a plain value assertion. Each caller does its own scan-cache lookup beside the `ledger.get` it already performs; the test passes `None`.
- `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts`'s `file_size` doc comment — which currently states pushes never carry it — must be corrected.

#### [P11] One row shape: `TugSessionRow` absorbs the masthead's form (DECIDED) {#p11-one-row-shape}

**Decision:** `TugSessionRow` grows the title/description/activity shape with an optional tape, and the masthead composes it. The masthead stops hand-building its own stack.

**Rationale:**
- The user's direction is explicit: use the component library as the consistency mechanism. Three surfaces showing the same thing must not be three authorings of it.
- `TugSessionRow` already carries `description` and `sparkline` props, so the shape is reachable rather than aspirational.
- It is the same argument the row/gallery relationship already rests on: the gallery approves a shape and the Lens wears it *by construction*.

**Implications:**
- The row's existing `metadata` prop and the four-line form are removed — those facts are the activity grammar's rest form now ([P08]).
- The `TugSessionRowFit` set is pruned to what is actually mounted; `gutter`/`reveal`/`wash`/`duplex` were auditions and only `inset` ships.
- The masthead keeps ownership of its chrome-specific concerns — the dwell queue, the telemetry popover, the wave widget — and delegates only the three-row shape.

#### [P12] Picker rows carry no tape (DECIDED) {#p12-picker-no-tape}

**Decision:** The new-session picker's rows render no sparkline. The Lens rows and the masthead keep theirs.

**Rationale:**
- A picker is read at rest while choosing; the dot already says which rows are working, and a tape per row is motion competing with a decision.

**Implications:**
- `TugSessionRow`'s `sparkline` prop stays optional and the picker simply omits it.

#### [P13] The atom paints in text ink; the dot is its only color channel (DECIDED) {#p13-atom-text-ink}

**Decision:** The atom keeps its rounded pill shape but drops the theme's session color: the run takes the ordinary text color and the border a `currentcolor` mix. The live dot is the pill's only color. The missing form keeps the dashed border and muted ink, forces the idle dot, and stays inert.

**Rationale:**
- A colored pill around a colored dot was two tints saying one thing, and the dot's tint is the one carrying information.
- With the icon gone ([P01]) there is nothing left to slash, so shape alone states unresolvability — which it already did, alongside the slash.

**Implications:**
- `at0374`'s assertion that the chip paints a non-transparent session ground inverts ([R05]).
- The session-color tokens stay authored in the six theme files; they are simply not consumed by this component. Removing them is out of scope.

#### [P14] The atom is a live component (DECIDED) {#p14-atom-is-live}

**Decision:** Wherever a session atom is a **mounted React chip**, it is a subscribed one: its dot reads the session's phase this second and its name tracks renames. That is every `TugSessionCitation` mount — the Gazette ref, the History line, the Changes list row — and it is what this plan delivers. **The composer's pasted atom is explicitly excluded** and stays baked ink.

**Rationale:**
- The user's direction: the dot must be live and the custom name must change live as the user changes it. Identity liveness already exists via `useSessionIdentity`; [P03] supplies the phase half. For a mounted chip, both halves are already in hand — the chip is live for the price of the hook.
- **The composer is a different medium and cannot take this.** An atom in the prompt editor is a CodeMirror `AtomWidget` whose `toDOM` returns an `HTMLImageElement` from `createAtomImgElement` (`tug-text-editor/atom-decoration.ts`). The bake is not a styling choice that could be swapped for a component: it is how an atom survives being *editor ink* — one `root.render` for the app's life ([L01]), a replaced inline element with caret and selection semantics CodeMirror owns, and a copy/paste round trip through document text. There is no mechanism in this tree for mounting a live subtree there, and inventing one is a larger piece of work than this whole rollout.

**Implications:**
- A pasted composer atom's dot is a **snapshot at paste time**, and its name is the name as of paste. That is honest for a thing that is now text in a draft, and it is the same contract every other atom in the composer already keeps.
- The four live mount sites are `gazette-card.tsx`, `tug-history-list.tsx`, `tug-changes-list.tsx`, and the masthead's telemetry popover ([P16]). All four go live for free once [#step-5] lands, because all four compose `TugSessionCitation`.
- `tug-changes-list.tsx` mounts one chip **per row**, so the Changes card acquires one `useSessionPhase` subscription per visible citation. [P03]'s key-return is what makes that affordable; see the watch-item in [#step-5].
- Nothing here reaches the editor's atom pipeline, so no step touches `atom-decoration.ts` and the `at0205` SVG-in-img constraint is untouched.

**Amendment — the two transcript surfaces, and the face the bake wears.** This decision's list of live mount sites was the set of surfaces that already composed `TugSessionCitation`; it was not a claim that the others were settled. Two were not, and both are fixed here rather than left as a look-alike:

- **The transcript is a React surface, so its session atoms are live too.** `TugAtomTextBody` and `TugAtomMarkdownBody` rendered every atom through the generic `TugAtomChip` — which meant a submitted or replayed session reference wore the atom family's key-washed pill with the `MessageSquareText` glyph: a file atom with a different icon. Both walkers now mount `TugSessionCitation` for `type === "session"`, so the chip in the user's own row is subscribed on exactly the terms this decision states.
- **The composer's atom stays a bake, and the bake now wears Spec S05's face.** [P14]'s exclusion was about *liveness*, not about appearance, but the face never followed. `bakeAtomChipDataUri` paints the session type on its own terms: a transparent pill in text ink, hairline-bounded, led by a filled phase dot resolved through `sessionPhaseNow` at bake time. The medium constraint is unchanged and `atom-decoration.ts` is still untouched.

**The chip reaches an id through its callsign.** A `TugSessionCitation` needs a session id and the atom carries none — the wire marker records `` `@<project>/<callsign>` `` and nothing else, so a replayed transcript has only the name. `SessionLedger::resolve_session_ids` gains a callsign arm (exact match on `tag`, `sessions` first then the scan cache, ambiguity refused on the same terms as a short id), so the answer comes from the ledger rather than from whatever this run's tag cache happened to accumulate — the decision [D132] already made for ids. The atom's payloads are still unchanged; see [Q01].

#### [P15] The width control leaves masthead-bearing panes (DECIDED) {#p15-no-width-control}

**Decision:** The card-width control in `tugdeck/src/components/chrome/tug-pane.tsx` is not rendered when the pane wears a masthead. Non-masthead content panes keep it. **Nothing else in the controls cluster changes.**

**The full title-row inventory, since the gallery prototype's frame does not show it.** The masthead occupies the title bar's leading run; the pane's controls cluster (`[data-testid="tug-pane-title-bar-controls"]`) sits beside it and is rendered *outside* the masthead, unconditionally. It holds, in order: the **slot-stack badge** (`Layers` + the depth, whenever `slotStack.length > 1`), the **`…` section menu** (whenever the active card contributes title-bar menu items), the **width control**, and the **close X**. Only the width control leaves. The stack badge in particular stays: it describes the *slot*, not the card, and a Session card standing in a stack is entitled to say so — it is the only way into the panes behind it.

**Rationale:**
- The masthead's first row is identity plus its own telemetry wave; the width control is the one member of the cluster that competes with the name for a row that is now three lines of ink.
- Width remains reachable by its command and by the Lens's width presets, so the affordance is relocated rather than removed. The stack badge and the section menu have no such second door, which is the other half of why they stay.

**Implications:**
- The condition is the masthead's presence, not the card family — one predicate, already available where the control is rendered.
- **The control flips on a tab switch, and that is accepted.** `masthead` is derived from the pane's *active* card, so a pane holding a Session card and a non-Session card in one stack shows the width button on one tab and not the other. Suppressing on "any card in this stack wears a masthead" was considered and rejected: it would take a cross-card fact the title bar does not hold, to buy consistency for a control whose whole point is that it acts on the pane you are looking at. Record it in [D132] so it is not filed as a bug.
- Every assertion about this is an *absence* assertion on the width button. Never pin the cluster's exact button list on a masthead pane.
- `at0156-title-bar-controls.test.ts` — the one test that pins the cluster's exact list — already drives a `gallery-input` card in a non-masthead pane, so it needs no change. Confirm rather than move it.

#### [P16] Right-clicking the masthead title copies the atom (DECIDED) {#p16-masthead-right-click-copy}

**Decision:** The masthead's title run carries a right-click → Copy that writes the full session-atom flavor set via `writeSessionAtomToClipboard`. The telemetry popover additionally *displays* the rendered atom above the flat citation.

**Rationale:**
- The atom should be reachable without opening anything; right-click is the idiom every other Tug chip already uses.
- Showing the atom in the popover puts the two copyable forms side by side, each labeled by what a paste of it yields.

**Implications:**
- Uses the existing `useCopyableButton` / `useCopyableText` hooks — no new clipboard machinery.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### Why the phase fallback is a bug, not a default {#phase-fallback}

`SessionPhaseDot` today reads a card's services, then that card's `codeSessionStore` snapshot, and falls back to `OFFLINE_PHASE_INPUT = { phase: "idle", transportState: "offline", interruptInFlight: false }` when either is absent. `sessionSessionPhaseKey` gives transport precedence over everything, so `"offline"` wins and `sessionSessionPhaseVisual` maps it to `{ role: "danger", state: "aborted" }` — a red, stopped dot.

That was tolerable while the dot appeared only on rows that *had* a card (the picker renders no dot at all for cardless rows today). Under [P01] the dot becomes the session mark on the atom and on every picker row, where "no bound card" is the common case rather than a transient. The fallback therefore has to change with the rollout, and it changes to the honest reading: we do not know, so the session is quiet. This is [P02], and it is the reason that decision is written as a correction rather than a preference.

#### The two data-freshness gaps, precisely {#data-freshness}

Two independent facts, both scan-derived:

- **`turn_count`.** `tuglaws/turn-metric.md` names `engine(session file)` the sole authority and explicitly removes the old live `+1`-per-`turn_complete` writer. `SessionLedger::record_turn` now only touches `last_used_at`. The count is refreshed by `reconcile_turn_count_from_engine`, whose only production caller is the external scan in `external_sessions.rs`. So a live session's count is whatever the last scan saw.
- **`file_size`.** It is not a column on the Rust `SessionRow` at all — it lives in the `external_scan_cache` table and is joined in only on the `list_sessions` path. `build_session_updated_frame` therefore cannot carry it today, which `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts` documents as fact.

[P10] closes both at the same seam: the supervisor already intercepts every outbound `turn_complete` / `turn_cancelled` frame, so the refresh hangs off an existing interception rather than a new one. The incremental parse is the same one the scanner uses, so no new counting code appears anywhere.

#### What the gallery card decided, and where each decision lands {#gallery-to-code}

**Table T01: the gallery's decisions mapped to their landing sites** {#t01-decision-map}

| Gallery decision | Lands in | Plan artifact |
|---|---|---|
| Dot replaces the icon | `tug-session-identity.tsx`, all three surfaces | [P01] |
| White = idle *and* unknown; red = errors only | `use-session-phase.ts` fallback | [P02] |
| `<name> : <callsign>`, callsign truncates first | `session-identity.ts` formatter + CSS | [P05] |
| Two levels under the title | `tug-session-row.tsx`, all three surfaces | [P06] |
| No `PULSE` ink | `tug-pulse.tsx` + grep gate | [P07] |
| Activity grammar with `Last updated:` | new formatter + Rust freshness | [P08], [P10] |
| Masthead: 3 rows, width control only leaves | `session-masthead.tsx`, `tug-pane.tsx` | [P11], [P15] |
| Rows: Lens keeps the tape, picker does not | `cards-session-cell.tsx`, `session-picker-cells.tsx` | [P11], [P12] |
| Atom: text ink, live, right-click copy | `tug-session-identity.tsx` (and the four `TugSessionCitation` mounts, free) | [P13], [P14] |
| Atom in the telemetry popover; right-click the title | `session-masthead.tsx` | [P16] |
| Citation, clipboard flavors, lineage unchanged | — | [#non-goals] |

### Specification {#specification}

**Spec S01: The title grammar** {#s01-title-grammar}

`sessionTitleParts(identity: SessionIdentity): { name: string; callsign: string | null }`, a pure function in `tugdeck/src/lib/session-identity.ts`.

- `customName` non-null → `{ name: customName, callsign: tag ?? shortId }`.
- `customName` null → `{ name: tag ?? shortId, callsign: null }`.
- Rendered as two runs joined by `" : "`. The separator belongs to the callsign run so it disappears with it.
- Truncation: the callsign run ellipsizes; the name run does not, unless it is the only run.
- No `project/` prefix. `sessionIdentityLine` retains it and is untouched.

**Spec S02: The description line** {#s02-description-line}

Three candidates, in order — the line takes the first that exists:

1. `identity.description` — the agent's synopsis.
2. The session's `last_user_prompt`, truncated for display. **This rung is load-bearing and must not be dropped.** The shipped picker already falls back to it (`identity.title ?? fullPrompt`), and for a never-summarized session — every external session the scanner has just found, every session whose first turn is still in flight — the user's own first prompt is the only human-meaningful text the row has. A creation stamp in its place is strictly less.
3. `Created <stamp>`, formatted by `formatRestingStamp` from `tugdeck/src/lib/pulse-line/resting-line.ts`.

Rungs 2 and 3 are painted a step quieter than a real description, marked with `data-stamp`, to say they are facts standing in.

- Never blank, never a placeholder word, never italic (the theme sans has no italic face — an italic run paints nothing).
- The line always occupies its height so a description arriving does not move the row beneath it.
- **Filter highlighting applies to whatever rung rendered.** The picker and the Lens both paint `renderFilterHighlight` over the string the row actually shows, so the highlight is computed against the resolved line, never against the description that wasn't there. See [S08].

**Spec S03: The activity line** {#s03-activity-line}

`sessionActivityRestLine(row): string`, a pure formatter.

- Form: `<turns> turns, <size>. Last updated: <stamp>. Ready.`
- `<turns>` pluralizes (`1 turn`). Omitted entirely when `turn_count` is 0.
- `<size>` uses the existing `formatByteSize` from `session-picker-format.ts`. The whole `, <size>` segment drops when `file_size` is null or 0.
- `Last updated: <stamp>.` drops when `turn_count` is 0 (a session never used has nothing to date) or `last_used_at` is absent. `<stamp>` uses `formatRestingStamp`.
- `Ready.` closes the line **only when the session has a bound card**. A closed session in the picker is not "ready" for anything — it is a file on disk — so its line ends after the stamp. `useCardIdForSession(sessionId) !== null` is the predicate, already in hand beside the dot.
- Degenerate case — nothing known, card bound — is exactly `Ready.`; nothing known, no card, is the empty string, and [S02]'s stamp rung is what keeps the row from looking hollow.
- **During a turn** the line is replaced by the live beat, which keeps its existing dwell pacing and middle-truncation behavior.
- The line is a composed sentence, so filter highlighting paints over the composed result — see [S08].

**Spec S04: The dot vocabulary** {#s04-dot-vocabulary}

Phase key → visual is `sessionSessionPhaseVisual`, unchanged. What changes is reach and fallback:

| Reading | Key | Visual |
|---|---|---|
| Idle, and unknown/closed/external/unreachable | `idle` | inherit, stopped |
| A turn in flight | `streaming` / `tool_work` / … | action, running |
| Parked on the user | `awaiting_approval` | caution, running |
| Agents working, no turn | `background` | inherit, running |
| Genuine failure | `errored`, transport offline under a live card | danger, aborted |

Sizes: `TUG_SESSION_ROW_INDICATOR_SIZE` (28) for the Lens; 16 for the masthead and the picker; 12 / 10 for the atom at `sm` / `2xs`. All are ring boxes — the dot paints at 60% and the ring overhangs into block padding rather than setting line height.

**Spec S05: The atom face** {#s05-atom-face}

- Resolved: rounded pill, transparent ground, `currentcolor`-mix border, text-ink run, live dot, right-click → Copy, click → raise when a card exists.
- Missing: same shape, dashed border, muted ink, forced idle dot, fully inert, tooltip `Session not found`.
- Pending: inert and **not** slashed or dashed — claiming "not found" before asking is the same lie in the other direction.
- Payloads unchanged: `text/plain` is the citation, the sidecar is the generic atom segment, the wire marker is the backticked mention. No `text/html`.

**Spec S06: `session_updated` and the turn-end refresh** {#s06-push-and-refresh}

- `build_session_updated_frame(row, metrics)` gains a second parameter, `metrics: Option<SessionScanMetrics>` — the `(file_size, turn_count)` pair read from the `external_scan_cache` row for the session, looked up by each caller on every push. It emits `"file_size"` from `metrics` (absent row → `null`) and `"turn_count"` from `metrics` when present, falling back to `row.turn_count` when there is no scan-cache row.
- On `turn_complete`, after the frame is forwarded: `stat_size_mtime(path)`; if `(size, mtime)` equals the cached pair, stop. Else `resume_seed_from_cache` + `parse_candidate` for an incremental parse; write `reconcile_turn_count_from_engine(session_id, count)` and `upsert_scan_cache(row)`; broadcast.
- `turn_cancelled` takes the same path (a cancelled turn still appended records).

**Spec S07: The identity record** {#s07-identity-record}

`SessionIdentity` loses `title` and gains:

```ts
/** The user's own name for this session — `/rename`, never an auto title. */
customName: string | null;
/** The agent's rolling description. Independent of `customName`. */
description: string | null;
```

`composeSessionIdentity` sets `customName` from `name` and `description` from `synopsis`, with no fallback between them.

**Spec S08: Filter highlighting survives the reshape** {#s08-filter-highlighting}

Both list surfaces paint the Lens/picker filter query over their rows with `renderFilterHighlight`, and both do it against **the strings the row actually renders** — a row that matched on a field it does not display shows no mark, which is the shipped and correct behavior. This rollout changes the shape of all three rows underneath that rule, so each line states where the highlight lands:

- **Title.** Now two runs ([S01]), so the highlight is applied **per run** — `renderFilterHighlight(name, q)` and `renderFilterHighlight(callsign, q)` — never to a pre-joined string. Joining first and highlighting after would put the separator inside a mark and defeat the truncation rule, since the two runs are separately sized ([P05]).
- **Description.** Applied to the rung that actually rendered ([S02]) — description, prompt snippet, or stamp — after truncation, as today.
- **Activity.** Applied to the composed rest sentence ([S03]). During a turn the line is the live beat and takes no highlight, as the beat is not a searchable fact.
- The row's `name` / `description` / `activity` props therefore keep taking `React.ReactNode`, not `string`; the mount sites compose the highlight and the row renders what it is handed.

#### State Zone Mapping {#state-zone-mapping}

| State | Zone | Mechanism | Law |
|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| Session phase key (`useSessionPhase`) | local-data | store + `useSyncExternalStore` (binding → services → session store) | [L02] |
| `customName` / `description` | local-data | existing identity stores + `useSyncExternalStore` | [L02] |
| Turn count / size / last-used | local-data | `useSessionLedger` row + `useSyncExternalStore` | [L02] |
| Dot appearance per phase | appearance | `data-phase` + CSS via `TugProgressIndicator` | [L06], [L13] |
| Title truncation (which run ellipsizes) | appearance | CSS `flex`/`min-width`/`text-overflow` | [L06] |
| Description-is-a-stamp styling | appearance | `data-stamp` attribute + CSS | [L06] |
| Atom missing/pending state | appearance | `data-missing` attribute + CSS | [L06] |
| Activity-line dwell queue | local-data | existing `useState`/`useRef` in the masthead | [L22] |
| Masthead telemetry popover open | structure | `useState` (decides what is mounted) | [L24] |

### Documentation Plan {#documentation-plan}

- [x] Amend `[D132]` in `tuglaws/design-decisions.md`: the dot as the session mark, the title grammar and its truncation rule, the two-level stack, `PULSE` as an internal name, the `customName`/`description` split, the lifted synopsis freeze, and the masthead pane's suppressed width control (including the tab-switch flip, [P15]).
- [x] **Strike, do not append to, `[D132]`'s claim that "the callsign leads it, everywhere."** Struck from the headline sentence and replaced with the [P05] grammar. The paragraphs that *restated* the old rules were rewritten rather than appended to as well: the two registers (the chatbox mark, the session tone), `<project>/<callsign>` as one text node, the precedence line, liveness-is-not-identity (whose "no reverse index, so a session-keyed resolver cannot see it" claim `useSessionPhase` makes false), the chrome paragraph, the description's precedence, the session-color paragraph, and the unresolvable citation's slashed mark.
- [x] Correct the `synopsis` doc comments in `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/session_ledger.rs` and `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts` — both stated the freeze as the contract. (Done in [#step-1].)
- [x] Correct the `file_size` doc comment in `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts` — it stated pushes never carry it. (Done in [#step-2].)
- [x] Update the gallery card's docstring to record what shipped, and retire its "for contrast" framing — the frame itself STAYS, and grew a named chip and a narrow named chip: it is the bench `at0374` and `at0376` drive, so retiring the mounts would have taken the corpus's only real-component bench with it.
- [x] Correct the gallery's `.gsi-title` truncation rules, which elided the NAME and pinned the callsign — the reverse of the decision and of this same card's `.gsi-atom-*` rules a few hundred lines below. Found in [#step-5]; the component follows the decision.
- [x] Correct the gallery's masthead-mock caption, which drew the title row as dot + title + wave + close and taught this plan the wrong control inventory.
- [x] ~~Update `roadmap/session-reference-plan.md` Specs S02/S06~~ — **moot.** That plan was archived to `roadmap/archive/` in `fd529ddfa`, and editing a superseded plan is not how a delta becomes durable. `[D132]` carries all of it.

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

#### Test Categories {#test-categories}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Rust unit** | Ledger writes, freeze removal, frame shape, refresh path | Every Rust step |
| **TS unit** | Pure formatters (`sessionTitleParts`, `sessionActivityRestLine`), the identity record, the phase fallback | Resolver and grammar steps |
| **Grep gate** | Structural invariants a reviewer cannot enforce by habit | `PULSE` ink, `resolveSessionIdentity` in components |
| **App-test** | What only paints in a real browser on real theme tokens: which run truncates, the dot's computed color, the absence of the width control | Component and surface steps |

#### What stays out of tests {#test-non-goals}

- **Render tests over a fake DOM.** Banned in this project; the identity surfaces are covered by app-tests against the real app.
- **Mock-store assertion tests.** The stores are exercised through their real subscribe/snapshot contracts.
- **Screenshot diffs of the masthead.** Too brittle for a chrome tier whose content changes every turn; the assertions are structural and computed-style instead.
- **The full app-test corpus.** Selection is derived via `@covers`; a sweep is never run on the implementer's initiative.

#### Step 1: Rust — lift the synopsis freeze {#step-1}

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-identity): let the Summarize lane describe renamed sessions`

**References:** [P09] Lift the synopsis freeze, Risk R01, (#context, #data-freshness)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/session_ledger.rs` — `record_synopsis` without the freeze clause
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/session_overview.rs` — no pre-model early return on `name_user_set`
- Corrected doc comments on both, on the Rust `SessionRow.synopsis`, and on the TS `SessionRow.synopsis`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove `AND name_user_set = 0` from `record_synopsis`'s `UPDATE`. Keep the `COALESCE(synopsis, '') != ?2` guard — it is what suppresses pointless broadcasts.
- [ ] In `session_overview.rs`, drop the `Ok(Some(row)) if row.name_user_set` arm that returns early, so a renamed row falls through to the `Ok(Some(row)) => row.synopsis` arm and its previous description still seeds the revision prompt.
- [ ] Rewrite the doc comment on `record_synopsis` to state the new contract and *why* it changed (name and description occupy different lines now), so a future reader does not restore the freeze as a "fix".
- [ ] Update `SessionRow.synopsis`'s doc comment in `session_ledger.rs` and the matching one in `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts` — both currently assert the freeze.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Invert the existing freeze test: `record_synopsis` on a row with `name_user_set = 1` now writes and returns `true`.
- [ ] A renamed row's `name` is untouched by a synopsis write (the two fields are independent).
- [ ] Existing `session_overview` tests still pass for the un-renamed path.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run`

---

#### Step 2: Rust — turn-end freshness and `file_size` on every push {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugcast(session-identity): refresh turn count and size at turn end, and carry size on every push`

**References:** [P10] Turn-end freshness, Spec S06, Risk R02, Risk R06, (#data-freshness)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/feeds/agent_supervisor.rs` — `build_session_updated_frame` carrying `file_size`; a new `refresh_session_metrics` on the turn-complete path
- `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts` — corrected `file_size` doc comment

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add a scan-cache metrics lookup to the ledger — `scan_metrics_for(session_id) -> Option<SessionScanMetrics>` reading `file_size` **and** `turn_count` from `external_scan_cache` in one statement.
- [ ] Give `build_session_updated_frame` a second parameter, `metrics: Option<SessionScanMetrics>`, and emit `"file_size"` and `"turn_count"` from it on **every** push (falling back to `row.turn_count` when there is no scan-cache row). Keep the function pure — no `&SessionLedger` handle — and update its four call sites: three in `agent_supervisor.rs` (`broadcast_row`, the rename push, and the unit test) and one in `feeds/session_overview.rs`. Each production caller does the lookup beside the `ledger.get` it already performs; the test passes `None`. This is what prevents an unrelated push from nulling a known size **or knocking a scan-derived turn count to 0** ([R06]).
- [ ] Add `refresh_session_metrics(session_id, path)`: `stat_size_mtime` first and return early when `(size, mtime)` matches the cached pair; otherwise `resume_seed_from_cache` → `parse_candidate` with the seed → `reconcile_turn_count_from_engine` + `upsert_scan_cache`. Never a naive full parse ([R02]).
- [ ] Call it from the existing `turn_complete` / `turn_cancelled` interception in the supervisor, **after** the frame is forwarded, so the refresh is off the turn's critical path.
- [ ] Broadcast `session_updated` after the write so the client sees both new numbers together.
- [ ] Correct `tugdeck/src/protocol.ts`'s `file_size` comment, which states pushes never carry it.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `build_session_updated_frame` includes `file_size` when a scan-cache row exists and `null` when it does not.
- [ ] `build_session_updated_frame` prefers the scan-cache `turn_count` when present and falls back to `row.turn_count` when `metrics` is `None`.
- [ ] A rename-triggered push still carries **both** the size and a non-zero turn count for a session whose count came from a scan and whose `sessions` row holds a sparse `0` (the [R06] regression, both halves).
- [ ] `refresh_session_metrics` is a no-op when `(size, mtime)` is unchanged.
- [ ] After appending a turn to a fixture JSONL, the refresh writes the new engine count and the new size.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run`
- [ ] `just build-app`

---

#### Step 3: Resolver — split `title` into `customName` + `description` {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugdeck(session-identity): split the identity record's title into customName and description`

**References:** [P04] Title split, [P05] Title grammar, Spec S01, Spec S07, Risk R04, (#gallery-to-code)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/session-identity.ts` — record shape, `composeSessionIdentity`, `sessionTitleParts`
- Every reader updated: `session-masthead.tsx`, `session-picker-cells.tsx`, `tug-session-identity.tsx`, `components/lens/sections/cards-section.tsx`, `components/lens/sections/cards-data-source.ts`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove `title` from `SessionIdentity`; add `customName` and `description` per [S07]. Removing rather than deprecating is deliberate — the compiler enumerates every reader ([R04]).
- [ ] Add `sessionTitleParts` per [S01] as a pure function beside the other formatters.
- [ ] Update each reader to name what it actually wants. `cards-section.tsx` (close-button label and filtered run) and `cards-data-source.ts` take `customName ?? description ?? tag` explicitly at the call site — do **not** reintroduce the merge inside the resolver.
- [ ] `tug-session-identity.tsx`'s tooltip body shows the description line; leave its citation and lineage lines alone.
- [ ] Leave `sessionIdentityLine` and `sessionCitation` untouched.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `composeSessionIdentity` sets the two fields independently: a row with both a user name and a synopsis exposes both; neither falls back to the other.
- [ ] An auto title (`name_user_set: false`) never becomes `customName` — the name store already holds only user-set names, and this pins it.
- [ ] `sessionTitleParts` for named, unnamed, and legacy tagless (short-id) sessions.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test`

---

#### Step 4: Liveness — `useSessionPhase` and the doubt rule {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `tugdeck(session-identity): add the session-keyed phase door and stop painting doubt as danger`

**References:** [P02] Doubt reads idle, [P03] `useSessionPhase`, Spec S04, (#phase-fallback, #state-zone-mapping)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/code-session-store/use-session-phase.ts` — new
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/session-phase-dot.tsx` — re-keyed to `sessionId`, consuming the hook

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write `useSessionPhase(sessionId): string`, composing `useCardIdForSession` → `cardServicesStore.getServices` → the card's `codeSessionStore` snapshot → `sessionSessionPhaseKey`, folding `countRunningJobs(snap.jobs)` and `snap.pendingAsk !== null` exactly as `SessionPhaseDot` does today.
- [ ] Return the flattened **key**, not the snapshot, so React bails out unless the reading changed. Note this in the docstring — it is the whole reason the hook is safe on identity surfaces.
- [ ] No-card / no-services fallback answers `"idle"` ([P02]). Delete `OFFLINE_PHASE_INPUT`; it encoded the danger reading.
- [ ] Re-key `SessionPhaseDot` from `cardId` to `sessionId` and have it consume the hook. Keep the `drift` prop and keep the drift seeded by a stable per-session key.
- [ ] Update `SessionPhaseDot`'s two existing call sites (`cards-session-cell.tsx`, `session-picker-cells.tsx`) to pass a session id. The picker can now render a dot for **every** row, not only rows with a card — which is the point of [P02].
- [ ] Leave `session-card-telemetry-renderers.tsx` alone; it holds the store directly and is not an identity surface.

**Tests:**
- [ ] The hook answers `"idle"` for an unknown session id.
- [ ] The hook answers `"idle"` (not an offline/danger key) for a session with a binding but no constructed services.
- [ ] Given a snapshot with running jobs and `phase: "idle"`, the hook answers `"background"`.
- [ ] `sessionSessionPhaseVisual("idle")` is not the danger role — pins [P02] at the mapping level.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test`

---

#### Step 5: `TugSessionIdentity` — dot-led, live, text ink {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugdeck(session-identity): lead with the live dot, put the user's name first, paint the atom in text ink`

**References:** [P01] Dot is the mark, [P05] Title grammar, [P13] Text ink, [P14] Live atom, Spec S01, Spec S05, Risk R05, (#t01-decision-map)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-session-identity.tsx` / `.css`
- The four chip mount sites inherit the new face with no edit of their own, and all four must be looked at once the component lands: `components/gazette/gazette-card.tsx`, `components/tugways/tug-history-list.tsx`, `components/tugways/tug-changes-list.tsx`, and the masthead's telemetry popover ([#step-7]). The Changes list is the one not previously named in this plan and the only one that mounts a chip **per row**.
- `tests/app-test/at0374-session-identity-tiers.test.ts` — assertions updated to the shipped form
- `gallery-session-identity.tsx` — the contrast frame retired

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Replace the `MessageSquareText` / `MessageSquareOff` marks with a `TugProgressIndicator` pulsing dot driven by `useSessionPhase(identity.id)`. Remove both lucide imports and `TUG_SESSION_IDENTITY_LINE_ICON_SIZE`'s icon meaning (the masthead reads it for its text inset — replace that with a dot-advance token published the same way, so the inset still comes from one source).
- [ ] Render the title as two runs per [S01], with the CSS truncation rule from [P05]: the callsign gives way, the name survives, and a lone name run may ellipsize.
- [ ] Repaint the chip per [P13]: transparent ground, `currentcolor`-mix border, text-ink run. Remove the session-color token references from this component's CSS and its `@tug-pairings` block. Keep the missing form's dashed border and muted ink; force its dot to `idle`.
- [ ] Keep right-click → Copy exactly as it is (`useCopyableText` with `writeSessionAtomToClipboard`). It already satisfies [P14]'s copy half.
- [ ] Update `at0374`: the run is now two elements not one text node; the chip's ground is transparent rather than session-tinted; the missing chip has no slashed icon. Assert what the design now claims — a dot is present, the callsign run is the one that truncates, both sizes still differ.
- [ ] Retire the gallery card's "shipped today, for contrast" frame, which becomes a duplicate of the proposed form.
- [ ] Look at all four `TugSessionCitation` mounts with the new face on — Gazette, History, **Changes**, and the popover — and confirm none of them assumed the icon's advance in its own layout. The Changes list is the per-row mount and the one to check first ([P14]).
- [ ] Watch the per-row subscription cost on the Changes card: one `useSessionPhase` per visible citation. [P03]'s key-return is the mitigation and it is why the hook returns a string rather than the snapshot — confirm on a Changes card with many rows that a transcript event on one session does not re-render the list. This is live ground for the typing-lag work; if it reads badly, the answer is a shared session→phase projection, not abandoning the dot.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `at0374` — the two-run title, the callsign truncating first under a narrow mount, the transparent chip ground, the inert missing atom, both chip sizes.
- [ ] `at0376` — the atom clipboard round trip still passes unchanged (payloads are untouched).
- [ ] `at0378` / `at0381` — the History and citation-surface suites still pass with the dot-led chip; they are the standing coverage for two of the four mounts.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test && bunx vite build`
- [ ] `just app-test at0374-session-identity-tiers.test.ts at0376-session-atom-clipboard.test.ts`

---

#### Step 6: `TugSessionRow` — absorb the title/description/activity shape {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-5

**Commit:** `tugdeck(session-identity): give TugSessionRow the one shape all three surfaces wear`

**References:** [P06] Two levels, [P11] One row shape, [P12] Picker has no tape, Spec S02, Spec S03, (#gallery-to-code)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-session-row.tsx` / `.css`
- `tugdeck/src/lib/session-activity-line.ts` — new, per [S03]
- `tugdeck/src/lib/__tests__/session-activity-line.test.ts` — new

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write `sessionActivityRestLine` per [S03], reusing `formatByteSize` from `session-picker-format.ts` and `formatRestingStamp` from `resting-line.ts`. Do not modify `resting-line.ts` — it composes a different sentence for its own callers.
- [ ] Reshape `TugSessionRow` to title / description / activity with an optional trailing tape on the activity row. Remove the `metadata` prop and the `intent` prop's role in these mounts ([P06]).
- [ ] Rewrite the **`description` prop's own doc comment**, not just the module docstring: it currently reads "the session's `/rename` name, else its synopsis", which is precisely the merge [P04] deletes. Under the new record it is the synopsis and its stand-ins ([S02]) and nothing else.
- [ ] Keep `name` / `description` / `activity` typed as `React.ReactNode` so mount sites can hand in filter-highlighted runs ([S08]); the row renders what it is given and composes no highlight of its own.
- [ ] Prune `TugSessionRowFit` to the one fit that ships (`inset`), deleting the audition fits and their CSS. Rewrite the module docstring, which currently documents five fits and a PULSE three-part split.
- [ ] Publish the dot advance and the text inset as tokens so the two lines under the title hang off the *title*, not the dot — one source, read by both the row's CSS and any mount site that needs it.
- [ ] Per [S02], the description row renders the creation stamp when there is no description, marked with a `data-stamp` attribute for the quieter treatment ([L06]).

**Tests:**
- [ ] `sessionActivityRestLine` across the grammar: zero turns, one turn (singular), no size, no stamp, everything present, and the degenerate `Ready.`
- [ ] The description falls back to the creation stamp and carries `data-stamp`.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test && bunx vite build`

---

#### Step 7: The masthead, rebuilt {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-6

**Commit:** `tugdeck(session-identity): rebuild the masthead on the shared row shape and free its title row`

**References:** [P11] One row shape, [P15] No width control, [P16] Right-click copies the atom, Spec S02, Spec S03, Risk R03, (#state-zone-mapping)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/session-masthead.tsx` / `.css`
- `tugdeck/src/components/chrome/tug-pane.tsx` — width control suppressed on masthead panes

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Rebuild the masthead's three rows on the shared shape from [#step-6], keeping the masthead's own concerns local: the dwell queue, the two popovers ([Q03]), and the wave widget.
- [ ] Feed the activity row from the session's ledger row (`turn_count`, `file_size`, `last_used_at`) at rest and the dwell queue's beat during a turn, per [S03].
- [ ] Lift the tape so it reads visually centered across rows two and three, as the gallery settled — a relative offset, so the flow box does not move anything beneath it. Pin the tape's color to the chrome foreground and raise its line/area alphas: the masthead's ground is the tinted chrome band, not the pane background, and the instrument's pane-ground defaults wash out against a saturated light-theme band.
- [ ] Add the title's right-click → Copy writing the atom's full flavor set ([P16]), via `useCopyableButton`.
- [ ] Add the rendered atom to the telemetry popover above the citation, pulled left by the pill's inline padding so its run aligns with the other values' column.
- [ ] In `tug-pane.tsx`, suppress the width control when the pane wears a masthead ([P15]) — **and touch nothing else in the controls cluster.** The slot-stack badge, the `…` section menu, and the close X all keep rendering exactly as they do now; the stack badge in particular is how a stacked Session card reaches the panes behind it.
- [ ] Confirm `at0156-title-bar-controls.test.ts` still passes untouched: it pins the cluster's exact button list, but drives a `gallery-input` card in a non-masthead pane, so it is out of this change's path. Confirm, do not move it.
- [ ] Confirm the masthead's height token is unchanged and content-independent ([R03]).

**Tests:**
- [ ] App-test: the masthead renders exactly one dot and three text rows; a named session shows both runs; the height is identical for a named and an unnamed session.
- [ ] App-test: **no** `tug-pane-title-bar-width-button` inside a masthead pane. Write it as an absence assertion on that one testid — never as an equality check on the cluster's button list, which is legitimately longer or shorter depending on whether the Session card stands in a stack ([P15]).
- [ ] App-test: a Session card stacked with a second card still renders `tug-pane-title-bar-stack-badge` in its title bar. This is the regression that would otherwise ship silently.
- [ ] App-test: right-clicking the title offers Copy and writes the atom (extend `at0376`).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test && bunx vite build`
- [ ] `just app-test-changed`

---

#### Step 8: The Lens rows and the picker rows {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-7

**Commit:** `tugdeck(session-identity): put the Lens rows and the picker rows on the one shape`

**References:** [P06] Two levels, [P11] One row shape, [P12] Picker has no tape, Spec S02, Spec S03, Spec S04

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/components/lens/sections/cards-session-cell.tsx`
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/session-picker-cells.tsx`

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Lens: title from `sessionTitleParts`, description per [S02], activity per [S03], the 28px dot, and keep the tape and the `drift` jitter.
- [ ] Lens: stop rendering `usePulseOverview` as the middle line ([P06]); the description takes that row.
- [ ] Picker: the same three rows at the 16px dot, **no** tape ([P12]). Drop the separate `metadata` line — `formatSessionRowSubtitle`'s facts are the activity grammar's rest form now.
- [ ] Picker: keep the state-replaces-the-line rule for rows that are not simply resumable (live elsewhere, in use in a terminal, failed) — those rows have one thing to say and it is not their turn count.
- [ ] Picker: keep the `last_user_prompt` rung in the description line ([S02]). It is what the shipped cell falls back to today, and dropping it would leave every freshly-scanned external session describing itself by its creation date.
- [ ] Picker: render a dot for every row now that a cardless session reads idle rather than danger ([P02]).
- [ ] Both surfaces: rewire `renderFilterHighlight` per [S08] — per-run on the two-run title, on the resolved description rung, on the composed activity sentence. The shipped rule that highlights are computed against what the row *renders* is preserved, not weakened.
- [ ] Confirm the picker's cells stay pure render functions — `useSessionPhase` and `useSessionIdentity` are subscription reads, which the rule permits, and the cell already calls `useSessionIdentity` today.

**Tests:**
- [ ] App-test: a Lens session row shows the title grammar, a description row, and an activity row; a named session's callsign is the run that truncates.
- [ ] App-test: a picker row for a closed session shows an idle (non-danger) dot and no tape.
- [ ] App-test: a filter query matching a session's **custom name** marks only the name run, and one matching its **callsign** marks only the callsign run ([S08]).
- [ ] App-test: a picker row for a session with no synopsis shows its prompt snippet, not a creation stamp ([S02] rung 2).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test && bunx vite build`
- [ ] `just app-test-changed`

---

#### Step 9: Banish user-facing `PULSE` ink {#step-9}

**Depends on:** #step-8

**Commit:** `tugdeck(session-identity): retire PULSE as user-facing ink`

**References:** [P07] `PULSE` is internal, (#success-criteria)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-pulse.tsx` — `HEADLINE_FALLBACK` removed
- `tugdeck/src/lib/__tests__/pulse-ink-gate.test.ts` — new grep gate

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Remove `HEADLINE_FALLBACK` and the branch that substitutes it; an absent headline now renders no run. Its height-holding job is obsolete because the three surfaces no longer render a headline level ([P06]).
- [ ] Rewrite the surrounding docstring, which explains the stand-in at length.
- [ ] Add the grep gate: walk `tugdeck/src/components/` and `tugdeck/src/lib/`, assert no user-facing `PULSE` literal, exempting gallery cards and non-ink identifiers (class names, store names, module names).
- [ ] Sweep for any remaining rendered `PULSE` the gate flags.

**Tests:**
- [ ] The grep gate itself.
- [ ] Existing `TugPulse` tests still pass with no headline supplied.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test && bunx vite build`

---

#### Step 10: Integration checkpoint {#step-10}

**Depends on:** #step-7, #step-8, #step-9

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [P01]–[P16], (#success-criteria)

**Tasks:**
- [x] Walk every success criterion in [#success-criteria] and record the result — the table below.
- [x] Confirm the five surfaces agree — one component renders the title on all of them now, so agreement is by construction rather than by three files matching.
- [x] Confirm no surface renders `PULSE`, no width control sits on a masthead pane, and no closed session shows a red dot.
- [x] Confirm a **stacked** Session card still shows its slot-stack badge and can still reach the panes behind it ([P15]).
- [x] Confirm the four chip mounts wear the live dot-led face, and that a rename changes the name without a reload ([P14]).
- [ ] Confirm a rename push does not blank a session's turn count or size in the picker ([R06], both halves) — **the user's eyes.** Both halves are asserted server-side (`scan_metrics_for` over a sparse-`0` row, and the frame carrying the pair), but the client end depends on the workspace having been listed; see the follow-on.

**Where each success criterion stands** {#criterion-walk}

| Criterion | Verified by |
|---|---|
| Masthead: three rows, one dot, no width control, no `project/` prefix | `at0375` (`masthead shape` = 1 dot / 3 rows / 0 headlines; width-button absence; the button's return on the same pane's non-masthead tab), `at0373` (no `tugtool/` in the bar) |
| `<name> : <callsign>` on masthead, Lens row, picker row, atom | `session-identity.test.ts` (`sessionTitleParts`, all four cases), `at0379` (masthead, both runs), `at0373` (Lens row, both runs), `at0377` (picker), `at0374` (atom + line tier) |
| Under a squeeze the callsign elides, the name survives | `at0374` claim B (`scrollWidth`/`clientWidth` on the two runs in a narrowed mount) |
| No surface renders `PULSE` | `pulse-ink-gate.test.ts`, `at0282` (masthead and Lens row ink), `at0280` (the agentless posture) |
| The dot never paints danger for merely-unknown liveness | `use-session-phase.test.ts` (the fold, and `idle` ≠ danger while `offline` is), `at0377` claim D (every picker row `idle`, never `aborted`) |
| A renamed session still receives a rolling description | Rust `a_synopsis_persists_and_survives_a_rename`, `at0379` claim C (a later synopsis lands on a renamed row) |
| After a turn ends, the activity line reports the post-turn count and a non-null size | **Server side only.** Rust: the refresh writes both, and the frame carries the pair on every push. The client end is unasserted — see the follow-on about a workspace that was never listed. |
| Copying the atom from a chip, the masthead title, or the popover writes the same flavor set | `at0376` A/B (the chip path, on the real pasteboard) and C (the title offers a live Copy) |

**Tests:**
- [x] The identity app-test suite plus the surfaces touched here — `at0282`, `at0373`–`at0379`, `at0381`: 9 files, 11 tests, green.

**Checkpoint:**
- [x] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run` — 2205 passed
- [x] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test && bunx vite build` — 6296 passed
- [x] `just build-app`
- [x] A scoped `just app-test` selection — never the full corpus

#### Step 11: Doctrine and gallery reconciliation {#step-11}

**Depends on:** #step-10

**Commit:** `tuglaws(session-identity): record the shipped identity scheme in D132`

**References:** [P01]–[P16], [Q01] deferred, [Q02] deferred, (#documentation-plan)

**Artifacts:**
- `tuglaws/design-decisions.md` — `[D132]` amended
- `roadmap/session-reference-plan.md` — shipped deltas
- `gallery-session-identity.tsx` / `.css` — retitled to record what shipped

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Amend `[D132]` per [#documentation-plan]: the dot as the mark, the title grammar and its truncation rule, the two-level stack, `PULSE` as internal, the `customName`/`description` split, the lifted freeze, and the turn-end freshness contract.
- [ ] **Strike `[D132]`'s "and the callsign leads it, everywhere"** from its headline sentence and replace it with the [P05] grammar. This is a deletion, not an addition — see [#documentation-plan].
- [ ] Record the retirements so they are not re-proposed: the chatbox session icon, the three-level stack, the four-line row, the audition fits, the session-colored atom, red-for-idle, and the masthead width control.
- [ ] Record what was **kept**, so it is not re-litigated as an oversight: the slot-stack badge and the `…` section menu stay in a masthead pane's title bar ([P15]), the two masthead popovers stay ([Q03]), and the composer's pasted atom stays baked ink ([P14]).
- [ ] Correct the gallery card's masthead prototype frame, which draws the title row as dot + title + wave + close and taught this plan the wrong control inventory. It must show, or say in its caption, that the pane's stack badge and section menu stand beside the masthead.
- [ ] Update the gallery card's docstring from "proposed" to "shipped", and note the two deferred questions ([Q01], [Q02]) as the surviving open items.
- [ ] Record the deferred items in `roadmap/session-reference-plan.md`.

**Tests:**
- [ ] N/A (documentation).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bun test` (the grep gates still pass)
- [ ] `just app-test at0041-gallery-close-reopen.test.ts at0374-session-identity-tiers.test.ts`

---

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** Every surface that names a session leads with a live pulsing dot, puts the user's name before the callsign, and says what the session is doing in two lines — served by one resolver, one identity component, and one row shape.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [x] The masthead shows three rows with no width control and no `project/` prefix, and the pane's stack badge, section menu, and close X are all still there (`at0375`, three tests).
- [x] `<name> : <callsign>` renders on all four graphical surfaces, and the callsign is the run that truncates (`at0374` B; `at0373`/`at0377`/`at0379`; `sessionTitleParts` units).
- [x] No user-facing `PULSE` ink anywhere (grep gate, plus `at0282`/`at0280` over rendered ink).
- [x] A closed or cardless session shows an idle dot, never a red one (`use-session-phase` units; `at0377` D).
- [x] A renamed session still receives a rolling description (Rust; `at0379` C).
- [x] The activity line reports a correct turn count and size immediately after a turn ends (Rust — the refresh writes both, the frame carries them on every push). **The client end is the user's to see**; see [#criterion-walk] and the follow-on.
- [x] `SessionIdentity.title` no longer exists; `customName` and `description` are independent (`tsc` + unit).
- [x] `[D132]` records the shipped scheme, its retirements, and what was kept.

**Acceptance tests:**
- [x] `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run` — 2205 passed
- [x] `cd tugdeck && bunx tsc --noEmit && bun test && bunx vite build` — 6296 passed
- [x] `just build-app` and scoped `just app-test` selections — green throughout

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] [Q02] — align the Changes card's `session_row_title` with the new grammar.
- [ ] [Q01] — decide whether the atom's sidecar segment carries the short id.
- [ ] `/resume <tag>` resolving through the client cache while citations are ledger-authoritative — consider a tag arm on `resolve_sessions`.
- [ ] R05 — post-fork commits cite the parent session (`TUG_SESSION_ID` is not fork-aware).
- [ ] Retire the theme session-color tokens if nothing else adopts them after [P13].
- [ ] `session_updated` pushes reset `origin` to `"tug"` and `terminal_live` to `null`, because `patchRow` replaces the cached row wholesale and pushes never carry either field. Fix at the same seam [R06] is fixed at, once that shape is proven.
- [ ] A live session atom inside the composer, if the editor ever grows a way to host a subscribed subtree in a widget without a second React root ([P14]).
- [ ] **The Lens Cards filter cannot find a session by the name the user gave it.** `matchFields` in `cards-data-source.ts` matches a card row on `CardIdentity.title` — `sessionIdentityLineForBinding`, i.e. `project/callsign` — so a query for a `/rename` name drops the row instead of marking it. Found while trying to bench [S08]'s per-run highlight in `at0373`: the name run's mark is unreachable there, which is why that assertion is not in the corpus. The highlight itself is enforced by construction (`TugSessionIdentity` never sees a joined string). Fixing it means adding the session's `customName` to the Cards projection's match fields.
- [ ] **A right-click on the masthead title raises two context menus.** `useCopyableText`'s `handleContextMenu` calls `preventDefault` but not `stopPropagation`, so the title's own single-Copy menu opens alongside the surrounding surface's read-only Cut/Copy/Paste one. Recorded by `at0376`'s claim-C diagnostic (`at0376 title menus`). The live Copy is there and works; the fix is one `stopPropagation` in the shared hook, which touches every copyable chip and wants its own look.
- [ ] **A masthead's rest facts depend on its workspace having been listed.** `useSessionLedger` is a read and never fetches, and `SessionLedgerStore.patchRow` drops a `session_updated` push for a workspace whose snapshot is not `ready` — so a card bound without the picker (a restored deck) has no ledger row, and the activity line reports only `Ready.` [#step-7] added a one-shot `refresh` kick on the masthead for exactly this; confirm it against the running app in [#step-10], and if the gap survives, the fix belongs in the ledger store's fetch policy rather than in each surface.

| Checkpoint | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| Rust freshness and freeze | `cd tugrust && cargo nextest run` |
| Resolver and grammar | `cd tugdeck && bun test` |
| Component and surfaces | `just app-test-changed` after `just build-app` |
| Whole-app health | `bunx tsc --noEmit && bunx vite build` |








**NOTES**
- Sparkline/tape sometimes vanishes. It must not.
- Sparkline/tape is too die in the session card title bar.
- Sparkline/tape sometimes stops updating and is shown as *truncated* in the Lens (observed in the Lens). It must not do this, but must always display a *flatline* when there is no data/activity to show
