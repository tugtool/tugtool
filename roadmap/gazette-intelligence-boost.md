## Gazette Intelligence Boost {#gazette-intelligence-boost}

**Purpose:** Make the Gazette's Operator reliably answer topical questions ("what was the recent commit where we tried to regularize tooltip colors and presentation?") from the facts library, the channel, and git — by fixing the index vocabulary, the ranking, and the query path that today lose answers the ledger demonstrably holds.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

On 2026-08-15 the user asked the Gazette: *"what was the recent commit where we tried to regularize tooltip colors and presentation?"* The Operator answered that it could not pin down the commit. The answer exists in every layer the Operator can reach: git holds `ac462ba3a` ("tugways(entity-tips): unify commit hover into a real TugTooltip", 2026-08-13, 27 files, the commit that created `roadmap/tooltip-cleanups-brief.md`); the facts library holds it as a `commit` fact (id 6291 in the release-main ledger) *and* holds the prompt that started the work; the channel holds four Reporter posts narrating the session. The investigation (this plan's ancestry) reproduced each failure against the live release ledger:

1. **Vocabulary.** `facts_fts` uses FTS5's default unicode61 tokenizer, which holds `TugTooltip` as the single token `tugtooltip`. `MATCH 'tooltip'` and even `MATCH 'tooltip*'` do not match the one commit fact that answers the question (verified directly: fact 6291 matches `'tugtooltip'` only). Tug's own naming convention — Tug-prefixed CamelCase components, kebab-case files, `at0365`-style test ids — systematically defeats its own index.
2. **Ranking and budget.** `MATCH 'tooltip'` returns 39 facts; the top 30 by raw `bm25()` (the `FACTS_SEARCH_LIMIT` page) are 28 `shell` facts — the greps the tooltip session itself ran — plus one `prompt` and one `session.renamed`. A `commit` fact can never win a "which commit" question against dozens of shell commands that literally contain the query word.
3. **Fragile query, no recovery.** The natural phrase query `'tooltip colors'` matches **zero** facts (FTS5 implicit AND). An empty result costs the model its round; with `MAX_RETRIEVAL_ROUNDS = 2` one mis-aimed first round is fatal. The Operator's closing line — "I'd need a search scoped to 'tooltip' in the commit history" — wished for `git.log`'s `grep` argument, which it already has.
4. **No observability.** The log records only `shared agent call task=operator-retrieve outcome=ok elapsed_ms=…`. The verbs and arguments the model chose are not logged anywhere; the incident could only be reconstructed by inference.

This plan fixes all four, in the layer order that matters: index vocabulary (with its migration), ranking and result budgeting, deterministic Rust-side query recovery, instruction teaching, and per-verb logging — closed out by replaying the original question against a copy of the real ledger and requiring the right commit.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- Fix the data layer first: a sub-word `tokens` column in both FTS indexes makes plain-English queries match CamelCase/kebab-case/path vocabulary at all. Everything downstream assumes this exists.
- Rank with intent: weight `subject` above `text` above `tokens`, and budget the result page across fact kinds in Rust so one noisy kind (`shell`) cannot spend the whole page.
- Recover deterministically, not heroically: when a sanitized query returns zero rows, the *system* retries with relaxed and sub-word-expanded variants before the model ever sees an empty result. Model rounds are precious (two, by design); Rust retries are free.
- Reach past vocabulary with the model we already have: a last-resort Haiku expansion rung turns a question with no shared words into candidate search terms, buying most of what semantic recall would buy without a new model asset ([P09], [Q01]).
- Teach the model what is now true: retrieve/answer instructions gain the FTS semantics, the kind-aiming rule, and the "recent commit about X is `git.log grep=X`" pattern; the pinning tests move with them.
- Land observability with the first commit (per-verb INFO logging), so every later step of this plan is diagnosable while it is being built.
- Verify against reality: a new hidden `tugcast operator-ask` subcommand runs the real pipeline against a named ledger copy, and the exit criterion is the original question answered with `ac462ba3a`.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- `facts.search` with query `tooltip` against a ledger containing fact 6291's text returns that commit fact on the first page (unit test on a seeded ledger; manual check against a release-ledger copy).
- `facts.search` with the phrase query `tooltip colors` returns non-empty results (the recovery ladder relaxes it) and the result JSON says what query was actually used (unit test).
- A search page is never all one kind when other kinds matched: with 35 matching `shell` facts and 2 matching `commit` facts seeded, the page contains both `commit` facts (unit test).
- Every executed verb produces one INFO log line naming the verb, its args, ok/err, and elapsed time (log inspection during the closing replay).
- `tugcast operator-ask --db <copy> "what was the recent commit where we tried to regularize tooltip colors and presentation?"` answers with `ac462ba3a` (closing verification, real model, real ledger copy).
- A pre-migration ledger (no `tokens` column, old FTS shape) opens cleanly, backfills, rebuilds its FTS, and answers the vocabulary queries above (migration unit test).
- A query sharing **no** token with the record it should find returns rows via the [P09] expansion rung, and returns the honest empty result when the pool is absent (unit test with a scripted Haiku pool — `scripted_haiku_pool` already exists in `shared_agent.rs`'s test module — plus a `haiku: None` case).

#### Scope {#scope}

1. Sub-word tokenization: a normalizer, a `tokens` column on `facts` and `gazette_posts`, both FTS tables re-shaped to index it, and the self-healing migration that gets existing ledgers there.
2. Ranking: bm25 column weights and kind-diversity result budgeting in `facts.search`; column weights in `gazette.search`.
3. Query hygiene and recovery: sanitize model-written FTS queries, and on empty results retry with a deterministic relaxation ladder, in `facts.search` and `gazette.search`.
4. A last-resort model expansion rung on that ladder, served by the existing Haiku pool ([P09], Spec S06).
5. Operator instruction updates (retrieve and answer) plus their pinning tests.
6. Per-verb INFO logging in the Operator pipeline.
7. `tugcast operator-ask` — a hidden CLI subcommand to run the Operator pipeline against a named ledger, for verification and future calibration.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Vector/embedding retrieval — deferred with findings and a named successor path in [Q01]. [P09]'s expansion rung is model-mediated *lexical* recall, not a vector space, and shipping it does not make this plan a semantic-search plan.
- Reviving on-device inference ([Q01] establishes it is gone; [P09] deliberately needs nothing local).
- Raising `MAX_RETRIEVAL_ROUNDS` (see [P05]).
- FTS over `shell_exchanges.db` — `shell.history` keeps its substring search.
- Changing the Operator's model, timeouts, worker caps, or scrollback size.
- Any tugdeck/frontend change — the Gazette card renders answers; nothing about rendering changes.
- Backfilling facts for work that predates the facts library (the library starts 2026-08-12; older history is git's to answer, which is what the `git.log grep` teaching is for).

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- rusqlite 0.33 with the `bundled` feature (workspace `tugrust/Cargo.toml`) — SQLite ≥ 3.45, so FTS5 external-content tables, the `'rebuild'` command, and `bm25()` column weights are all available.
- The existing self-healing migration idiom in `session_ledger.rs` (idempotent `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` with the `is_duplicate_column` helper near the bottom of the file).
- A copy of the release-main ledger for the closing verification (`just db-inspect` produces one; the copy path is what `operator-ask --db` takes).
- The Haiku agent pool (`HAIKU_AGENT_JOBS` / `SharedAgentPool` in `shared_agent.rs`), already constructed in `main.rs`, for [P09]'s expansion rung. Nothing new is stood up — a second `AgentSpec` would be, and is not wanted here.

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- **Warnings are errors** (`-D warnings` via `tugrust/.cargo/config.toml`).
- **Never open live ledger DBs with foreign SQLite**; the closing verification runs against a *copy*. Writable ledger opens go through `tugcore::ledger_db` (enforced by the `no_ad_hoc_ledger_opens` test) — `operator-ask` opens its ledger the same way `SessionLedger::open` always does.
- `sessions.db` is per-instance and uses **self-healing idempotent migrations on open** — there is no migrations table and no version bump for it (that regime belongs to the shared `changes.db` only). All schema work in this plan must be idempotent and safe to run on every open.
- The Operator's model-facing error strings are read by a model, not a human log — keep that voice in anything new that returns `Err(String)`.
- Instruction strings are pinned by tests in `gazette_agent.rs` (`the_job_table_carries_every_contract_the_gates_depend_on` and neighbors); wording changes must move the pins in the same commit.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- The facts corpus stays small enough (tens of thousands of rows) that overfetch-then-budget in Rust and full FTS rebuilds on migration are cheap. The release-main ledger is ~20 MB with ~9.6k facts after three days; even 100× that rebuilds in seconds.
- Sonnet remains the Operator model (`DEFAULT_MODEL = "sonnet"` in `gazette_agent.rs`); nothing in this plan depends on a smarter model, and that is deliberate — the data layer should carry the weight.

### Reference and Anchor Conventions (MANDATORY) {#reference-conventions}

This plan follows `tuglaws/devise-skeleton.md`: explicit `{#anchor}` on every cited heading, kebab-case anchors without phase numbers, two-digit stable labels (`[P01]`, `[Q01]`, `S01`, `R01`), `**References:**` lines citing labels and anchors (never line numbers), and `**Depends on:**` lines carrying `#step-N` anchors.

---

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Embedding-based retrieval as a second recall channel (DEFERRED) {#q01-embedding-retrieval}

**Question:** Should the facts library also carry a vector index so questions match facts by meaning rather than by shared vocabulary?

**Why it matters:** Sub-word tokenization ([P01]) and the relaxation ladder ([P04]) fix *vocabulary* mismatch — different spellings of the same word. They cannot fix *concept* mismatch. "Where did we fix the thing that made the cards flash" shares no token with any record of that work, and no amount of splitting or OR-relaxation manufactures one. If the Gazette's bar is answering questions phrased the way a person actually thinks, some semantic recall channel is eventually required.

**What was established while devising this plan (2026-08-15), so it is not re-derived later:**

- **There is no Anthropic embeddings API, and the `claude` CLI has no embedding surface.** `claude --help` exposes `agents`, `auth`, `mcp`, `plugin`, `project`, `setup-token`, `update`, `ultrareview`, `doctor`, `gateway`, `import` — nothing returning a vector. Anthropic's own embeddings documentation exists to redirect to Voyage AI. Embeddings therefore mean a *separate model*, always; the only question is which one and where it runs.
- **Tug no longer ships an on-device inference runtime.** No llama.cpp / GGUF / MLX code remains in `tugrust/crates` or `tugapp/Sources`; `shared_agent.rs` and `main.rs` reference the on-device backend in the past tense ("the idle unload the on-device backend **used**", a path that "**used to** run on the on-device pack"), the local-model plans live in `roadmap/archive/`, and the only remnant is an unused asset at `~/Library/Application Support/Tug/models/qwen3-4b-instruct-2507-4bit`. A local embedding model means *reviving* on-device inference, not reusing it.
- **The third-party API route is rejected on data-egress grounds, not cost.** Voyage/OpenAI/Google/Cohere embeddings cost pennies per million tokens, but embedding the facts library means transmitting every prompt the user has typed and every command they have run to a vendor. The library is the complete record of their work. This would be the first place Tug sends user data outside Anthropic, and it is not a decision to make as a sub-step of a search-ranking plan.

**Options (if known):**
- Local embedding model (bge-small / nomic-embed class, a few hundred MB) plus a revived inference runtime, a `fact_embeddings` table of f32 blobs, and brute-force cosine over the small corpus (no vector index needed at this scale).
- Third-party embeddings API — **rejected**, per the data-egress finding above.
- Model-mediated query expansion using the Haiku pool that already ships — adopted for this plan as [P09], and the reason this question stays deferred rather than becoming the next plan by default.

**Plan to resolve:** Ship this plan, including [P09] expansion. Then use the instruments this plan builds — the [P06] per-verb logs and the `operator-ask` question suite ([P08], Spec S05) — to collect real questions that still miss. If misses persist after expansion, devise a successor plan for local embeddings with that question suite as its eval gate.

**Resolution:** DEFERRED — with a named successor path and a concrete resolution instrument, not an open-ended "revisit someday". The deferral rests on three findings above (no Anthropic embeddings, no surviving local runtime, third-party egress rejected) plus [P09], which attacks the same failure using infrastructure that ships today.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Migration bug corrupts an FTS index on a live ledger | med | low | FTS is derivable state: the migration's last resort is always drop + `'rebuild'` from the content table; sequencing in Spec S03 keeps triggers dropped while rows churn | any `MATCH` error or missing-row report after upgrade |
| New ranking degrades queries that worked | med | low | Weights are modest (4/2/1); kind budgeting only caps a kind when others matched; unit tests pin both the old wins and the new | a real question where the right fact is present but off-page |
| Recovery ladder returns noise for genuinely unanswerable queries | low | med | Every relaxed result carries a `note` naming the query actually used, so the answering model knows the match is loose | answers citing loose matches as exact |
| Instruction-pin tests drift from wording | low | med | Pins updated in the same commit as wording ([P07]); the existing test style asserts substrings, not full text | `cargo nextest` failure |
| `operator-ask` misused against a live ledger | med | low | The subcommand is hidden, takes an explicit `--db` path, and its help text says "point this at a copy"; it never writes | — |
| Expansion rung adds latency to failing searches | low | med | Fires only on a doubly-empty result, at most once per verb call, inside `VERB_TIMEOUT` (10 s) with a 6 s job ceiling; any error or timeout degrades to the empty result | expansion appearing in the p50 path rather than the tail |
| Expansion returns plausible-but-wrong rows | med | med | Every expanded result carries `query_used` and a note saying the terms were model-suggested, so the answering model can see the match is indirect ([P09]) | answers citing expansion hits as direct evidence |

**Risk R01: FTS rebuild cost on open** {#r01-fts-rebuild-cost}

- **Risk:** The one-time migration (backfill + `'rebuild'` of two FTS tables) slows instance startup on large ledgers.
- **Mitigation:** It runs once per ledger (the stale-shape check is cheap and false afterwards); the release ledger's ~9.6k facts backfill and rebuild in well under a second; the work happens on `open` before the server accepts connections, which is where every existing self-healing migration already runs.
- **Residual risk:** A ledger orders of magnitude larger pays a one-time seconds-long open. Acceptable.

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] Sub-word vocabulary via a normalized `tokens` column, not a trigram tokenizer (DECIDED) {#p01-tokens-column}

**Decision:** Keep unicode61 on the existing indexed columns and add a third indexed column, `tokens`, holding a normalized sub-word bag derived at write time (Spec S01). Both `facts_fts` and `gazette_posts_fts` gain it.

**Rationale:**
- The trigram tokenizer would give substring matching but makes every multi-word MATCH a literal substring search (`'tooltip colors'` would still miss), muddies bm25 into trigram-frequency ranking, and degrades `snippet()` output. The failure being fixed is *vocabulary*, not substring-ness.
- A derived column keeps word-level AND/OR/phrase semantics, keeps `snippet()` on the human-readable columns, and lets `bm25()` weight the derived vocabulary *below* the authored text ([P03]).
- Write-time derivation costs one pure-function call per fact/post insert; the corpus is small and append-mostly.

**Implications:**
- `facts` and `gazette_posts` each gain a nullable `tokens TEXT` column; the FTS tables and their three sync triggers are re-declared to carry it; existing ledgers migrate per Spec S03.
- `record_fact_tx` (session_ledger.rs, the single INSERT path for facts) and the gazette-post insert path compute `tokens` from the same strings they store.
- The normalizer is a public pure function so tests and the backfill share it (Spec S01).

#### [P02] The normalizer emits only derived words, lowercase, deduped (DECIDED) {#p02-normalizer-emits-derived}

**Decision:** `subword_tokens` emits only sub-words that are *not* already whole unicode61 tokens of the input — the originals are already indexed by the `subject`/`text`/`body` columns; duplicating them would double-count in bm25.

**Rationale:**
- The `tokens` column exists to add vocabulary, not to re-weight existing vocabulary.
- Deduping keeps the column small and the index honest.

**Implications:**
- `TugTooltip` contributes `tug tooltip`; `tooltip` alone (already a token wherever it appears in prose) contributes nothing.
- The function is deterministic and order-stable so backfill and insert produce identical bytes for identical input.

#### [P03] Ranking: bm25 column weights plus kind-diversity budgeting in Rust (DECIDED) {#p03-ranking}

**Decision:** `search_facts` orders by `bm25(facts_fts, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0)` (subject, text, tokens) and overfetches `3 × limit` rows, then a Rust budgeter enforces kind diversity per Spec S02 before returning `limit` rows. `search_gazette_posts` orders by `bm25(gazette_posts_fts, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0)` (body, refs, tokens) with no kind budgeting (posts have no kinds).

**Rationale:**
- `subject` is the headline handle (a sha, a command incipit, a name) — a hit there is almost always what the question meant; weighting it up is the cheapest precision win.
- bm25 cannot know a `commit` fact outranks 28 `shell` facts for a "which commit" question; no static weight fixes that without breaking "which command" questions. Diversity budgeting sidesteps the guess: every matching kind gets on the page, and an explicit `kind` filter disables the budgeter entirely.
- Budgeting in Rust (not SQL) keeps the SQL simple and the policy unit-testable.

**Implications:**
- `search_facts` gains no new SQL clauses beyond the weights; the budgeter is a pure function over the overfetched rows (Spec S02).
- When the budgeter drops rows, the verb's JSON says so (a `note` naming the capped kind and how many were dropped) — no silent truncation.

#### [P04] Query hygiene and an empty-result relaxation ladder, Rust-side (DECIDED) {#p04-query-recovery}

**Decision:** `facts.search` and `gazette.search` sanitize the model's query into a safe FTS5 MATCH expression, run it, and on zero rows walk a deterministic relaxation ladder (Spec S04) before returning. The result JSON always names the query that actually produced the rows.

**Rationale:**
- A model round is the scarcest resource in the pipeline (two rounds, hard cap); a Rust retry costs microseconds. The system should never hand the model an empty page when a relaxed query has rows.
- Sanitization (quoting terms) also retires the "FTS5 says what it disliked" failure mode for the common case — a model writing natural language should never syntax-error the index.

**Implications:**
- New pure functions (sanitize, relax, expand — Spec S04) with unit tests; `gazette_search`/`facts_search` in `operator.rs` call them.
- The verb keeps returning `Err` only for arguments that are wrong in kind (missing query, bad types), not for query *content*.

#### [P05] `MAX_RETRIEVAL_ROUNDS` stays at 2 (DECIDED) {#p05-rounds-stay-two}

**Decision:** The round cap does not change.

**Rationale:**
- The observed failure was not round starvation; it was round *waste* — empty results from a fixable index and query path. [P01]–[P04] make round one land.
- A third round adds 5–10 s of model latency to exactly the questions that are already slow, and the answer instructions already teach answering with what is known.

**Implications:**
- If logged verb rounds ([P06]) later show recovered queries still routinely needing a third round, that is the trigger to revisit — recorded here so the decision isn't reopened by accident.

#### [P06] Every executed verb logs one INFO line (DECIDED) {#p06-verb-logging}

**Decision:** The Operator pipeline logs, per executed verb: verb name, compact args JSON (capped), ok/err, elapsed ms, and a result-size hint (row count where the verb returns a `count`, else byte length).

**Rationale:**
- The 2026-08-15 incident was unreconstructable — only `shared agent call task=operator-retrieve outcome=ok` exists in the log. One line per verb makes every future miss a five-minute read instead of archaeology.
- INFO, not DEBUG: the volume is at most `MAX_VERBS_PER_ROUND × MAX_RETRIEVAL_ROUNDS = 12` lines per question, and questions are user-initiated.

**Implications:**
- Lands in Step 1 so the rest of the plan is observable while being built.
- Args are logged after the argument gate reads them, capped at ~300 chars — never a place where a huge pasted string floods the log.

#### [P07] Instructions teach the index they now have (DECIDED) {#p07-instruction-updates}

**Decision:** `OPERATOR_RETRIEVE_INSTRUCTIONS` gains three teachings — (a) FTS queries are AND-of-terms: prefer one distinctive word, add `kind` when the question names a kind of thing ("which commit" → `kind: "commit"`); (b) identifiers are findable by their parts (`tooltip` finds `TugTooltip`); (c) "recent commit about X" is `git.log` with `grep`, and commits older than ~20 are unreachable without `grep`/`since`. `OPERATOR_ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS` gains one: before writing that a lookup you needed does not exist, re-read the verb list — if a verb could have answered it, ask for it (first round) or name it plainly as the follow-up the reader could ask (forced round).

**Rationale:**
- The transcript shows the model wishing for `git.log grep` while holding it. One sentence at the decision point is worth more than a syntactically documented argument.
- The recovery ladder ([P04]) makes single-word queries safe; the instructions should steer toward them so recovery is the backstop, not the norm.

**Implications:**
- The pinning tests in `gazette_agent.rs` assert the new load-bearing substrings in the same commit.

#### [P08] `tugcast operator-ask` is the verification harness (DECIDED) {#p08-operator-ask}

**Decision:** A hidden CLI subcommand runs the real Operator pipeline — real ledger, real verbs, real model — against an explicit `--db` path and prints the answer plus every verb round (Spec S05).

**Rationale:**
- "Replay today's question" must be a command, not a hope. The Reporter already has this shape (`tugcast gazette-replay`, hidden, calibration-only); the Operator gets the matching instrument.
- Point-at-a-copy keeps the live-ledger rule intact and makes the closing verification repeatable from any checkout.

**Implications:**
- `cli.rs` grows a second `Command` variant (the enum currently has exactly one, `GazetteReplay`, destructured with `let` in `main.rs` — that destructuring becomes a `match`).
- The subcommand constructs `OperatorContext` directly (ledger from `--db`, `bootstrap_project_dir` from `--project-dir`, no shell ledger unless `--shell-db` is given) and drives the same `answer()` path the feed uses.

#### [P09] Model-mediated query expansion on the Haiku pool, as the ladder's last rung (DECIDED) {#p09-query-expansion}

**Decision:** When the relaxation ladder ([P04], Spec S04) still has zero rows after its lexical rungs, `facts.search` and `gazette.search` ask the existing **Haiku** agent pool for candidate search terms and try once more with them. A new `expand_query` job joins `HAIKU_AGENT_JOBS` in `shared_agent.rs`.

**Rationale:**
- It attacks the concept-mismatch failure of [Q01] with infrastructure that ships **today**: `HAIKU_AGENT_JOBS` already carries `classify`, `classify_with_grammar`, `summarize`, `summarize_done`, `synopsis` on warm, persistent workers with a reviewed job table. No new model asset, no revived runtime, no new data egress — the facts already travel to Anthropic when the Operator answers.
- It is not true semantic recall (no vector space, no similarity ranking), but it converts an unanswerable-by-vocabulary question into answerable-by-vocabulary terms — "the thing that made the cards flash" → `flicker, repaint, transition, animation` — and the lexical index this plan is already fixing does the rest.
- It fires only where the alternative is returning nothing, so its cost lands exclusively on questions that are currently failing.

**Implications:**
- `OperatorContext` gains `haiku: Option<Arc<SharedAgentPool>>`. It is an `Option` because two of the four construction sites are tests and one is the new CLI (Spec S05); `None` means the rung is skipped and the empty result returns honestly, exactly as today. The production site is `main.rs`, which already holds the pool.
- The verb executor becomes model-touching for the first time. That is bounded deliberately: the rung runs at most **once per verb call**, only on a doubly-empty result, under the existing `VERB_TIMEOUT` of 10 s, and its own job timeout is `SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT` (6 s) via `JobClass::of`'s catch-all `Summarize` lane — a failed or slow expansion degrades to the empty result rather than failing the verb.
- Expansion terms are model-written strings that reach an FTS query, so they pass through `sanitize_fts_query` (Spec S04) like any other query text — never interpolated raw.
- The result JSON names the expansion explicitly (`query_used` plus a note saying the terms were model-suggested), so the answering model never mistakes a loose expansion match for a direct hit.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### Where everything lives today {#code-map}

All paths relative to `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/`.

- **`feeds/operator.rs`** — the whole Operator: verb executor (`run_verb`, `dispatch`, per-verb functions `gazette_search`/`facts_search`/`facts_list`/…), the caps block (`SEARCH_LIMIT = 20`, `FACTS_SEARCH_LIMIT = 30`, `GIT_LOG_DEFAULT_N = 20`, `GIT_LOG_MAX_N = 30`), the argument gate (`plain_arg`, `path_arg`, `sha_arg`), `OperatorContext`, and the pipeline (`answer()` — retrieve turn, verb loop `for request in requests { run_verb(…) }`, answer turn, `MAX_RETRIEVAL_ROUNDS = 2`, `MAX_VERBS_PER_ROUND = 6`). Its test module holds a fixture that builds an `OperatorContext` over a temp ledger — new verb tests belong there.
- **`feeds/gazette_agent.rs`** — the three job specs and their instruction strings: `REPORTER_POST_INSTRUCTIONS`, `OPERATOR_RETRIEVE_INSTRUCTIONS` (the verb list the model reads, including `git.log — optionally grep, pickaxe …`), `OPERATOR_ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS`; `DEFAULT_MODEL = "sonnet"`; the pinning tests (`the_job_table_carries_every_contract_the_gates_depend_on` and the per-job tests around it, which assert instruction substrings and pin `VERB_NAMES` against the retrieve text).
- **`session_ledger.rs`** — schema init (one large SQL block executed on open; `gazette_posts_fts` DDL with columns `body, refs`, `content='gazette_posts'`; `facts_fts` DDL with columns `subject, text`, `content='facts'`; three sync triggers each, named `<table>_fts_insert/delete/update`), the self-healing migrations (idempotent `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` calls, the `is_duplicate_column` helper), `search_facts` (bm25 order, `FactSearchFilter`, `snippet(facts_fts, -1, …)`), `search_gazette_posts` (bm25 order, `snippet(gazette_posts_fts, 0, …)`), `record_fact_tx` (the single INSERT path for facts; `NewFact { at_ms, kind, session_id, subject, text, payload, dedupe_key }`), and the gazette post insert path.
- **`feeds/facts_library.rs`** — `FactKind`, `render_text` (composes the one-line `text` every fact stores — where `TugTooltip` vocabulary enters facts), `render_detail`, `PROMPT_TEXT_CAP`.
- **`cli.rs`** — `Command` enum (single variant `GazetteReplay(GazetteReplayArgs)`, `#[command(hide = true)]`); **`main.rs`** dispatches it with `let cli::Command::GazetteReplay(args) = command;` (a `let` destructure that must become a `match` when a second variant lands).

#### The vocabulary failure, precisely {#vocabulary-failure}

Fact 6291's text: `commit ac462ba3a1ae "tugways(entity-tips): unify commit hover into a real TugTooltip" — 27 file(s)`. unicode61 splits on non-alphanumeric only; `TugTooltip` is one token. Verified against the release ledger: the fact matches `MATCH 'tugtooltip'`, does not match `MATCH 'tooltip'`, does not match `MATCH 'tooltip*'` (prefix search extends a token rightward; it cannot start mid-token). The same failure shape covers `tugways(entity-tips)` (`entity` and `tips` *do* split — parens and hyphen are separators — so kebab and punctuation are partially survivable; CamelCase is the systematic hole), `at0365` (letter/digit boundary does not split), and any `useSomeHook`/`TugListView` name in prose. Gazette post bodies carry the same vocabulary inside backticks, so `gazette_posts_fts` needs the same treatment.

#### Why overfetch-then-budget instead of SQL-side kind weighting {#why-budget-in-rust}

A SQL `CASE`-multiplier on bm25 per kind would need a per-question notion of which kind matters — which is the model's knowledge, not the ledger's. Diversity budgeting needs no such guess: it guarantees representation, not precedence. The overfetch factor 3 is enough because the budgeter only needs to *find* minority-kind rows, and bm25 with the [P03] weights already pulls subject-hits (commits by sha, commands by incipit) toward the front. With 39 total matches and `limit 30`, overfetching 90 fetches all of them; budget math only bites when matches exceed 3× the page, where a capped kind has dozens of rows on the page already.

### Specification {#specification}

**Spec S01: The sub-word normalizer** {#s01-normalizer}

New module `search_tokens.rs` (crate `tugcast`), pure functions, no I/O:

```rust
/// The normalized sub-word bag for one or more source strings.
pub fn subword_tokens(sources: &[&str]) -> String
```

Rules, applied per unicode61-style token (split input on any non-alphanumeric):

1. **CamelCase humps** split: `TugTooltip` → `tug`, `tooltip`; `TugActionTooltip` → `tug`, `action`, `tooltip`; `useSyncExternalStore` → `use`, `sync`, `external`, `store`. An all-caps run followed by a capitalized word splits at the boundary (`HTTPServer` → `http`, `server`).
2. **Letter/digit boundaries** split: `at0365` → `at`, `0365`.
3. Everything emitted is **lowercased**.
4. Emit a sub-word only if it is **not identical** (case-insensitively) to the whole source token it came from ([P02]) — `tooltip` from prose emits nothing; `Tooltip` as a standalone capitalized word emits nothing (its lowercase is the token unicode61 already indexes, which is case-folded by FTS5 anyway).
5. **Dedupe** across the whole output, preserve first-seen order, join with single spaces.
6. Drop sub-words shorter than 2 characters; cap the output at 2048 characters (cut at a whole sub-word).

Inputs per row: for a fact, `[subject.unwrap_or(""), text]`; for a gazette post, `[body, refs]` (refs is the stored JSON string; its paths and shas are exactly the vocabulary worth splitting).

**Spec S02: Kind-diversity budgeting for `facts.search`** {#s02-kind-budget}

Applied only when the caller passed no `kind` filter. Over the overfetched, bm25-ordered rows:

1. Walk rows in rank order, appending to the page, but once a single kind holds `KIND_PAGE_CAP = 12` rows, skip further rows of that kind while any other kind still has unpicked matches.
2. After the walk, if the page is short of `limit` and skipped rows remain, fill from them in rank order.
3. If any rows were skipped and not refilled, append to the verb's JSON: `"note": "results capped for balance: N more shell fact(s) matched; pass kind: \"shell\" to see them"` (kind and count computed, wording fixed).

The cap value 12 of a 30-row page lets a genuinely shell-heavy question stay shell-heavy while guaranteeing ≥18 rows of room for other kinds. Pure function: `budget_by_kind(rows: Vec<FactSearchHit>, limit: usize) -> (Vec<FactSearchHit>, Option<String>)` in `operator.rs`, unit-tested without a database.

**Spec S03: The migration, exactly ordered** {#s03-migration}

Runs inside `SessionLedger::open`'s existing self-healing sequence, before the server accepts work. Idempotent; every step is a no-op on an already-migrated ledger.

1. `ALTER TABLE facts ADD COLUMN tokens TEXT` and `ALTER TABLE gazette_posts ADD COLUMN tokens TEXT`, each swallowing `duplicate column name` via the existing `is_duplicate_column` helper.
2. **Stale-shape check:** read `SELECT sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'table' AND name = 'facts_fts'`; if the DDL does not contain `tokens`, the index is old-shape. Same check for `gazette_posts_fts`.
3. For each stale index: `DROP TRIGGER` its three sync triggers, then `DROP TABLE` the FTS table. (Triggers first, and *before* any row churn: an external-content FTS `'delete'` command with values that don't match what was indexed corrupts the index, so no trigger may observe the backfill.)
4. Run the normal schema-init SQL block, whose `CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `CREATE TRIGGER IF NOT EXISTS` statements now declare the new three-column shapes (facts: `subject, text, tokens`; posts: `body, refs, tokens`) and triggers carrying `new.tokens` / `old.tokens`.
5. **Backfill:** `SELECT id, subject, text FROM facts WHERE tokens IS NULL`, compute `subword_tokens`, `UPDATE facts SET tokens = ?1 WHERE id = ?2`; likewise `gazette_posts (id, body, refs)`. Safe with the new triggers live *only if* step 6 follows; on the stale path the triggers were just recreated over an empty index, so the interim trigger writes are discarded by:
6. If either index was stale in step 2: `INSERT INTO facts_fts(facts_fts) VALUES('rebuild')` (and the posts equivalent) — FTS5 discards the index and re-derives every row from the content table, now with `tokens` populated.

Fresh databases hit none of the special paths: columns exist from `CREATE TABLE` (add `tokens TEXT` to both base-table DDLs too), the FTS DDL is new-shape, backfill finds no NULLs, no rebuild. Insert paths (`record_fact_tx`, the gazette post insert) always write `tokens` so NULLs never reappear.

**Spec S04: Query sanitize and the relaxation ladder** {#s04-query-ladder}

Pure functions in `search_tokens.rs` (they share the normalizer), applied by `facts_search` and `gazette_search` in `operator.rs`:

- `sanitize_fts_query(raw: &str) -> Option<String>` — split `raw` on whitespace; strip characters FTS5 treats as syntax except a trailing `*` (kept for prefix queries, e.g. sha prefixes); double-quote each term; rejoin with spaces (implicit AND). `None` when nothing survives. A raw query that *is* already advanced syntax (contains `"` or ` OR ` or ` AND ` or `NEAR(`) passes through untouched — the model is allowed to be precise; sanitize exists for natural language.
- The ladder, on zero rows from the sanitized query:
  1. **OR-relax** (≥2 terms only): same quoted terms joined with `OR`.
  2. **Sub-word expand:** each term becomes `("term" OR "sub" OR "words")` using `subword_tokens` on the term itself (so a query for `TugTooltip` finds facts whose *tokens* column has `tug tooltip`, and a query for `tooltip` — which expands to nothing — keeps its own term); rungs 1's OR join across terms.
  3. **Model expansion** ([P09], Spec S06): ask the Haiku pool for candidate terms and run one more OR query built from them. Skipped entirely when `OperatorContext.haiku` is `None` or the job errors or times out.
  4. Zero rows after every rung: return the empty result honestly.
- Every response gains `"query_used"`: the expression that produced the rows, and — when a rung fired — `"note": "no facts matched the full query; showing matches for any term"` (wording per rung, fixed strings).
- A pass-through advanced query that FTS5 rejects still returns the FTS5 error as today (the model wrote syntax; it reads its own mistake). A sanitized query cannot syntax-error.

**Spec S06: The `expand_query` Haiku job** {#s06-expand-query}

A new `JobSpec` in `HAIKU_AGENT_JOBS` (`shared_agent.rs`), following that table's existing shape (`name`, `instructions`, `timeout`, `slow`):

- `name: "expand_query"`, `timeout: SUMMARIZE_TIMEOUT` (6 s), `slow: Some(Duration::from_secs(3))`. `JobClass::of` maps every non-classify name to the `Summarize` lane by its catch-all arm, so no change is needed there — but the plan records it so the implementer does not go looking.
- **Input:** the user's question, plus the fixed fact-kind vocabulary (`prompt`, `session.spawned`, `session.resumed`, `session.closed`, `session.errored`, `session.reset`, `session.renamed`, `session.compacted`, `commit`, `shell`, `test_run`) and two or three example fact texts so the model composes against the corpus's real register — the same teaching device `OPERATOR_RETRIEVE_INSTRUCTIONS` already uses.
- **Instructions** ask for the words that would *appear in the record* of the work described, not synonyms of the question: a commit subject, a filename fragment, a command name. State plainly that this is a search-term generator, that terms are OR-ed, and that 3–8 single words is the useful range.
- **Output:** strict JSON, `{"terms": ["flicker", "repaint", "transition"]}`, with `{"terms": []}` as a first-class answer meaning "nothing better to suggest" — the same silence-is-an-answer posture as `{"post": null}` in `REPORTER_POST_INSTRUCTIONS`. An unparseable turn is treated as `[]`.
- Terms are sanitized through `sanitize_fts_query` before they touch SQL and capped at 8.
- Pinned by the existing `the_haiku_job_table_carries_every_contract_the_gates_depend_on` test in `shared_agent.rs`, extended to assert the JSON shape and the empty-terms contract.

**Spec S05: `tugcast operator-ask`** {#s05-operator-ask}

```
tugcast operator-ask --db <path/to/sessions.db copy> --project-dir <repo> [--shell-db <path>] [--model <alias>] [--show-rounds] "<question>"
```

- Hidden (`#[command(hide = true)]`), like `gazette-replay`; help text states it is a calibration/verification instrument and must be pointed at a *copy* of a live ledger.
- Opens the ledger read-write through the normal `SessionLedger::open` (the copy makes that safe; the pipeline itself never writes facts), builds `OperatorContext` with `shell_ledger: None` unless `--shell-db` is given, runs the same retrieve → verbs → answer pipeline the feed runs (factoring the pipeline's entry so the feed and the CLI share it — the answer path currently lives on the feed's struct in `operator.rs`), and prints: each round's verb requests and result counts (`--show-rounds` prints full result JSON), then the answer body and refs.
- Exit 0 on an answer, 1 on a pipeline error. The [P06] log lines fire as normal.
- Model resolution follows `gazette_agent.rs` defaults; `--model` overrides for the run only (the `gazette-replay` pattern).

### Documentation Plan {#documentation-plan}

- [ ] Module docs on `search_tokens.rs` explaining the vocabulary problem in one paragraph (the `TugTooltip` example) so the next reader knows why the column exists.
- [ ] `session_ledger.rs` schema comments updated where the FTS DDL changes (the existing comment style documents intent inline).
- [ ] No tuglaws/roadmap doc changes — behavior is internal to the Gazette.

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

#### Test Categories {#test-categories}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Unit** | Normalizer, sanitizer, ladder, budgeter — pure functions, exhaustive edges | Steps 1, 3, 4 |
| **Integration (real SQLite)** | Seeded temp ledgers through the real `SessionLedger` — migration sequencing, FTS matching, ranking; the existing operator-fixture style | Steps 2, 3, 4 |
| **Contract** | Instruction pins in `gazette_agent.rs` and `shared_agent.rs`; `VERB_NAMES` vs instructions | Steps 5, 7 |
| **Scripted-agent** | The expansion rung driven by `scripted_haiku_pool` — the project's existing seam for agent-dependent logic; asserts routing and parsing, never model prose | Step 7 |
| **Live replay (manual, real model)** | `operator-ask` against a release-ledger copy — the closing verification | Step 8 |

#### What stays out of tests {#test-non-goals}

- Model behavior (whether Sonnet chooses good verbs, whether Haiku suggests good terms) — not deterministically testable; the live replay observes it, the logs ([P06]) make regressions diagnosable. The expansion tests assert routing, parsing, and degradation, never the quality of the terms.
- Mocked FTS or mocked ledger reads — banned shape; every index test runs real SQLite through `SessionLedger`.
- App-tests — no deck-visible behavior changes; the Gazette card renders whatever the answer post says.

#### Step 1: Normalizer module + per-verb logging {#step-1}

**Commit:** `tugcast(gazette-vocab): add sub-word normalizer and per-verb operator logging`

**References:** [P01] tokens column, [P02] derived-only emission, [P06] verb logging, Spec S01, (#vocabulary-failure, #code-map)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugrust/crates/tugcast/src/search_tokens.rs` with `subword_tokens` (Spec S01) and its unit tests; module registered in the crate.
- One `tracing::info!` per executed verb in `feeds/operator.rs`'s pipeline loop (`for request in requests { let outcome = run_verb(…) }`): verb name, args as compact JSON capped at 300 chars, ok/err, elapsed ms, result-size hint.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement `subword_tokens` per Spec S01 rules 1–6.
- [ ] Add the INFO log line around `run_verb` in the pipeline loop, timing each call.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `TugTooltip` → `tug tooltip`; `TugActionTooltip` → `tug action tooltip`; `useSyncExternalStore` → `use sync external store`; `HTTPServer` → `http server`.
- [ ] `at0365-gazette-card.test.ts` yields `at 0365` among its sub-words (letter/digit + separators).
- [ ] Plain prose (`unify commit hover into a real`) emits nothing ([P02] rule 4).
- [ ] Dedupe, ordering stability, the 2-char floor, and the 2048 cap cutting at a whole sub-word.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast search_tokens`
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo build -p tugcast`

#### Step 2: Schema — tokens columns, FTS reshape, migration {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugcast(gazette-vocab): index sub-word tokens in facts_fts and gazette_posts_fts, with self-healing migration`

**References:** [P01] tokens column, Spec S01, Spec S03, Risk R01, (#code-map, #vocabulary-failure)

**Artifacts:**
- `tokens TEXT` on `facts` and `gazette_posts` (base DDL + idempotent ALTER), three-column FTS tables and triggers, the stale-shape check, backfill, and conditional rebuild — all in `session_ledger.rs` per Spec S03's exact ordering.
- `record_fact_tx` and the gazette post insert path compute and store `tokens` via `subword_tokens`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `tokens` to both base-table `CREATE TABLE` blocks and as idempotent ALTERs (the `is_duplicate_column` idiom).
- [ ] Re-declare both FTS tables and all six triggers with the third column.
- [ ] Implement the stale-shape check + drop + backfill + rebuild in Spec S03's step order (triggers dropped before any row churn).
- [ ] Wire `subword_tokens` into both insert paths.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Fresh ledger: a fact whose text contains `TugTooltip` matches `MATCH 'tooltip'` via `search_facts` (the headline regression — the exact fact-6291 text as fixture).
- [ ] Gazette post with `TugTooltip` in the body matches `gazette.search 'tooltip'`.
- [ ] Migration: build a ledger with the *old* schema shape (create old-DDL FTS + rows in a temp db within the test, the way existing migration tests seed old shapes), reopen through `SessionLedger::open`, assert the stale path ran: `tokens` populated, `MATCH 'tooltip'` finds the `TugTooltip` fact, and FTS `'integrity-check'` passes.
- [ ] Reopen an already-migrated ledger: no rebuild (assert via unchanged FTS content and no error), NULL-free `tokens`.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast session_ledger`
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

#### Step 3: Ranking weights + kind-diversity budgeting {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugcast(gazette-rank): weight fact subjects in bm25 and budget search pages across kinds`

**References:** [P03] ranking, Spec S02, (#why-budget-in-rust, #code-map)

**Artifacts:**
- `search_facts` orders by `bm25(facts_fts, 4.0, 2.0, 1.0)`; `search_gazette_posts` by `bm25(gazette_posts_fts, 2.0, 1.0, 1.0)`.
- `facts_search` in `operator.rs` overfetches `3 × FACTS_SEARCH_LIMIT`, applies `budget_by_kind` (Spec S02) when no `kind` filter was passed, and emits the balance `note` when rows were dropped.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the weight arguments to both ORDER BY clauses.
- [ ] Implement `budget_by_kind` as a pure function; call it from `facts_search`; thread the `note`.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `budget_by_kind` unit: 35 shell + 2 commit matches, limit 30 → both commits on the page, shell capped at 12 then refilled to 30, note names `shell` and the dropped count.
- [ ] `budget_by_kind` unit: single-kind result set passes through untouched, no note.
- [ ] Ledger integration: seed 35 shell facts and 2 commit facts all containing `tooltip`; `facts.search` (no kind) returns both commit facts; with `kind: "commit"` returns exactly the 2, no note.
- [ ] Subject weighting: a fact whose *subject* is the sha outranks a fact whose *text* merely mentions it, for a sha-prefix query.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast operator`
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

---

#### Step 4: Query sanitize + relaxation ladder {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugcast(gazette-recover): sanitize operator search queries and relax empty results in Rust`

**References:** [P04] query recovery, Spec S04, Spec S01, (#code-map, #context)

**Artifacts:**
- `sanitize_fts_query`, `relax_or`, `expand_subwords` in `search_tokens.rs`; `facts_search` and `gazette_search` run the ladder and return `query_used` + rung `note`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement Spec S04's sanitize (with the advanced-syntax pass-through) and both rungs.
- [ ] Wire the ladder into both search verbs; keep FTS5 errors surfacing only for pass-through advanced queries.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Sanitize unit: `tooltip colors` → `"tooltip" "colors"`; `ac462ba*` keeps its trailing star; `weird (chars) -here` cannot syntax-error; already-quoted / `OR` queries pass through verbatim.
- [ ] Ladder ledger test: corpus where `tooltip colors` matches nothing but `tooltip` matches — the verb returns the `tooltip` rows with `query_used` = the OR form and the rung-1 note.
- [ ] Ladder ledger test: query `TugTooltip` against a fact indexed only via sub-words — rung 2 finds it.
- [ ] Genuinely unanswerable query returns an empty result with no invented rows and no note beyond honesty (`count: 0`).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast search_tokens operator`
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

---

#### Step 5: Instruction updates + pins {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-3, #step-4

**Commit:** `tugcast(gazette-teach): teach the operator FTS aiming, kind filters, and git.log grep for older commits`

**References:** [P07] instruction updates, [P05] rounds stay two, (#code-map, #context)

**Artifacts:**
- The three [P07] teachings in `OPERATOR_RETRIEVE_INSTRUCTIONS`; the one [P07] addition to `OPERATOR_ANSWER_INSTRUCTIONS`; pinning tests in `gazette_agent.rs` updated in the same commit.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write the retrieve additions: single-distinctive-word queries + `kind` aiming; sub-word findability; "recent commit about X" → `git.log grep=X`, and the >20-commit horizon without `grep`/`since`.
- [ ] Write the answer addition: re-read the verb list before claiming a lookup was impossible.
- [ ] Extend the pinning tests to assert the new load-bearing substrings.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `cargo nextest run -p tugcast gazette_agent` — pins green, including the existing `VERB_NAMES`-vs-instructions pin.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast gazette_agent`

---

#### Step 6: `tugcast operator-ask` {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugcast(operator-ask): hidden CLI to run the operator pipeline against a ledger copy`

**References:** [P08] operator-ask, Spec S05, [P06] verb logging, (#code-map)

**Artifacts:**
- `Command::OperatorAsk(OperatorAskArgs)` in `cli.rs` (hidden); `main.rs`'s single-variant `let`-destructure becomes a `match`; the pipeline entry in `feeds/operator.rs` factored so feed and CLI share it; round + answer printing per Spec S05.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the variant, args struct, and help text (including the point-at-a-copy warning).
- [ ] Factor the `answer()` pipeline behind a constructor the CLI can build (`OperatorContext` from `--db` / `--project-dir` / optional `--shell-db`).
- [ ] Print rounds (verb, args, count) and the final answer body + refs; `--show-rounds` prints result JSON; exit codes per Spec S05.

**Tests:**
- [ ] CLI parse test in `cli.rs`'s existing test module: the variant parses with `--db`, `--project-dir`, a question, and stays hidden from help.
- [ ] The factored pipeline entry compiles for both callers (the feed's existing operator tests keep passing — that is the regression proof).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo build -p tugcast`

#### Step 7: Haiku query-expansion rung {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugcast(gazette-expand): ask haiku for search terms when a search finds nothing`

**References:** [P09] query expansion, [Q01] embedding deferral, Spec S06, Spec S04, Risk table (#risks), (#code-map)

**Artifacts:**
- `expand_query` `JobSpec` + instructions in `HAIKU_AGENT_JOBS` (`shared_agent.rs`), per Spec S06.
- `OperatorContext.haiku: Option<Arc<SharedAgentPool>>`, populated at the `main.rs` construction site and left `None` at the two test sites and the `operator-ask` site.
- `expand_via_model` in `operator.rs` as ladder rung 3, wired into both search verbs with `query_used` + the model-suggested note.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add the `expand_query` JobSpec and write its instructions per Spec S06 (JSON out, `{"terms": []}` as a first-class answer, 3–8 single words, terms that would appear *in the record*).
- [ ] Add the `haiku` field to `OperatorContext` and populate it in `main.rs`; leave the other three construction sites `None`.
- [ ] Implement `expand_via_model`: call the pool, parse, treat unparseable as `[]`, sanitize every term through `sanitize_fts_query`, cap at 8, build the OR query, run it once.
- [ ] Extend `the_haiku_job_table_carries_every_contract_the_gates_depend_on` to pin the new job's output contract.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Scripted-pool test: a corpus where the question shares no token with the target fact; the scripted pool returns terms that do match; the verb returns the fact with `query_used` and the model-suggested note.
- [ ] `haiku: None` returns the honest empty result and never blocks (the degradation contract).
- [ ] A pool error, a timeout, and an unparseable turn each degrade to the empty result rather than failing the verb.
- [ ] Expansion does not fire when an earlier rung already found rows (assert the scripted pool was never called).
- [ ] Terms containing FTS syntax are sanitized, not interpolated raw.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast operator shared_agent`
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run -p tugcast`

#### Step 8: Integration checkpoint — replay the question {#step-8}

**Depends on:** #step-2, #step-3, #step-4, #step-5, #step-6, #step-7

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [P08] operator-ask, Spec S05, (#success-criteria, #context)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Copy the release ledger safely: `just db-inspect "/Users/kocienda/Library/Application Support/Tug/instances/release-main/sessions.db" "SELECT 1"` prints the temp-copy path it created; copy that `sessions.db` (with `-wal`/`-shm` already checkpointed into it) to a scratch path. Opening the copy also exercises the Spec S03 migration on real data.
- [ ] Run: `tugcast operator-ask --db <copy> --project-dir /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool --show-rounds "what was the recent commit where we tried to regularize tooltip colors and presentation?"`
- [ ] Confirm the answer names `ac462ba3a` (the Aug 13 `tugways(entity-tips)` commit) or presents it as the leading candidate with correct evidence; confirm one INFO line per executed verb appeared.
- [ ] Run two control questions against the same copy to check nothing regressed to noise: a shell question ("what did we run to check theme contrast?") and a session question ("which session was the tooltip work in?").
- [ ] Run one **concept-mismatch** question whose wording shares no vocabulary with the record (e.g. "when did we work on making the app feel less sluggish while typing" against the typing-lag work) to exercise the [P09] rung end to end, and record the terms it produced — that observation is the first datum for [Q01]'s eventual resolution.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `cd /Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/tugtool/tugrust && cargo nextest run` (full workspace, warnings-as-errors).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] The replay answers with `ac462ba3a`; the verb rounds show the recovery/ranking layers doing the work (visible via `--show-rounds` and the [P06] log lines).

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** A Gazette Operator that finds what the user is asking about — sub-word-indexed facts and posts, kind-balanced search pages, deterministic query recovery, a model-mediated expansion rung for questions that share no vocabulary with the record, instructions that aim the verbs, a log line per verb, and a CLI that proves it on the real ledger.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] `MATCH 'tooltip'` finds the `TugTooltip` commit fact through `facts.search` (unit + replay).
- [ ] Migration verified on a real pre-migration ledger copy (Step 8 opens one) and on synthetic old-shape fixtures (Step 2 tests).
- [ ] The 2026-08-15 question, replayed via `operator-ask` against the release-ledger copy, answers `ac462ba3a`.
- [ ] Every executed verb logs one INFO line (observed during the replay).
- [ ] `cargo nextest run` green across the workspace; `just build-app` succeeds so the release instance can pick the change up.

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] Step 2's fact-6291 fixture test (the headline regression, pinned forever).
- [ ] Step 3's budget tests; Step 4's ladder tests; Step 5's instruction pins.

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] [Q01] local embedding retrieval, if logged misses show lexical + recovery + [P09] expansion still failing — with the `operator-ask` question suite as its eval gate, and reviving on-device inference as its real cost.
- [ ] Revisit `MAX_RETRIEVAL_ROUNDS = 2` per [P05]'s trigger.
- [ ] A periodic `operator-ask` question suite as a calibration instrument (the `gazette-replay` pattern, for answers).
