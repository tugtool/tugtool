# Contrast Engine Overhaul

Four connected improvements to the theme contrast system: replace the third-party
contrast algorithm with our own OKLab-based metric, purge all third-party terminology,
de-duplicate formula constants, and make the derivation engine produce
contrast-compliant tokens by construction (eliminating auto-fix).

---

## Context: Theme Families and Contrast

The theme derivation engine takes a `ThemeRecipe` — 14 core color inputs (7 structural
hues + 7 role hues) plus mode (dark/light) and mood knobs — and generates a complete
264-token theme. The goal is to produce **families of themes** from a single color
palette: dark, light, dark+stark, light+stark, and potentially more profiles. This is
proven in practice — a single color input (blue) already generates four distinct,
coherent themes in the iOS word game.

Contrast is not a bolt-on check — it is a structural requirement of the derivation
engine. Every theme variant must produce legible text on every surface, across both
polarities (dark-on-light and light-on-dark), at every level of the visual hierarchy.
The engine must guarantee this by construction, not repair it after the fact.

### Element categories for contrast

Drawing from WCAG 3.0's outcome-based model and our own token system, the contrast
engine recognizes these element categories:

| Category | Threshold | Examples |
|----------|----------:|---------|
| body-text | 75 | fg-default, fg-link, field labels |
| large-text | 60 | button labels, headings |
| subdued-text | 45 | fg-muted, fg-placeholder, tab-fg-rest |
| ui-component | 30 | borders, icons, badges, accents |
| decorative | 15 | disabled states, dividers |

These categories map to the element/surface pairing map — each token is paired against
all surfaces it can appear on, and must meet the threshold for its category.

Dark mode support is a first-class requirement. The WCAG 2.x contrast ratio formula
(relative luminance ratio) is known to perform poorly for dark themes — it overstates
contrast for low-luminance colors. Our contrast metric must handle both polarities
correctly.

---

## Part 1: Replace the Contrast Algorithm

### Problem

The `computeLcContrast` function in `theme-accessibility.ts` is a direct
implementation of the APCA algorithm, using its specific constants (0.56, 0.57, 0.62,
0.65, 1.14, 0.027), its exponent (2.4), and its soft-clip logic. The constants are
explicitly labeled "APCA-W3 0.98G-4g". This is the APCA algorithm by any reasonable
assessment.

The APCA license restricts use of the algorithm, its constants, and associated
terminology. We have no interest in compliance games, trademark disputes, or
licensing obligations. We want legible text with good contrast.

### Solution: OKLab L with polarity correction

Replace the third-party algorithm with our own perceptual contrast function built
entirely from unencumbered color science.

**Foundation: OKLab perceptual lightness (Björn Ottosson, 2020, public domain)**

OKLab L is the most perceptually uniform lightness channel available in a simple color
space — Ottosson reports 0.20 RMSE on lightness prediction vs 1.70 for CIELAB L*.
We already compute OKLab L for every token in the palette engine (`oklchToLinearSRGB`).
The L channel is the natural input for our contrast metric.

**Polarity correction (published vision science)**

The raw OKLab ΔL is symmetric — it treats dark-on-light and light-on-dark identically.
But human vision is not symmetric. Published research establishes a ~15-20% legibility
disadvantage for light text on dark backgrounds at the same measured contrast:

- Piepenbrock, Mayr, Mund & Buchner (2013). "Positive display polarity is advantageous
  for both younger and older adults." Ergonomics, 56(7), 1116-1124.
- Piepenbrock, Mayr & Buchner (2014). Pupil constriction on bright backgrounds yields
  sharper retinal image.
- Whittle (1986). "Increments and decrements: Luminance discrimination." Vision
  Research, 26(10), 1677-1691.

The mechanism is well understood: bright backgrounds constrict the pupil, reducing
optical aberrations and sharpening the retinal image. This is foundational
psychophysics, not proprietary research.

**The algorithm:**

```typescript
/**
 * Compute perceptual contrast between an element and a surface.
 *
 * Returns a signed contrast score:
 *   - Positive: dark element on light surface (positive polarity)
 *   - Negative: light element on dark surface (negative polarity)
 *
 * Built from unencumbered color science:
 *   - OKLab L for perceptual lightness (Ottosson 2020, public domain)
 *   - Polarity correction from published vision research
 *     (Piepenbrock 2013, Whittle 1986)
 *
 * The polarity factor reduces the effective contrast score for negative
 * polarity (light-on-dark), reflecting the ~15-20% legibility disadvantage
 * established in the literature. This means light-on-dark text needs a
 * larger ΔL to achieve the same effective contrast as dark-on-light text.
 */
function computePerceptualContrast(elementHex: string, surfaceHex: string): number {
  const elementL = hexToOkLabL(elementHex);
  const surfaceL = hexToOkLabL(surfaceHex);

  const deltaL = surfaceL - elementL;

  if (surfaceL > elementL) {
    // Positive polarity: dark element on light surface
    return deltaL * CONTRAST_SCALE;
  } else {
    // Negative polarity: light element on dark surface
    // Apply polarity factor — light-on-dark needs more ΔL for same legibility
    return deltaL * CONTRAST_SCALE * POLARITY_FACTOR;
  }
}
```

**Constants to calibrate:**

| Constant | Role | Calibration method |
|----------|------|--------------------|
| `CONTRAST_SCALE` | Maps OKLab ΔL (0-1 range) to a 0-100 contrast score | Set so that the current Brio fg-default/bg-app pair produces a score near the body-text threshold |
| `POLARITY_FACTOR` | Reduces score for light-on-dark polarity | Start at 0.85 (reflecting ~15% published disadvantage), tune against the full Brio token set |
| `CONTRAST_MIN_DELTA` | Below this ΔL, contrast rounds to 0 | Engineering constant to avoid noise near zero |

**Calibration approach:**

1. Run the old metric and the new metric on every token pair in the Brio dark theme
2. Find `CONTRAST_SCALE` that makes the new score for fg-default ≈ old score
3. Find `POLARITY_FACTOR` that preserves the current pass/fail boundary for negative
   polarity pairs
4. Verify that the rank ordering of all pairs is preserved (no pair that currently
   passes should fail, no pair that currently fails should pass)
5. Set thresholds (75, 60, 45, 30, 15) based on the calibrated scale

This is a one-time calibration. The result is our own metric with our own constants,
built on public-domain foundations.

**Why this works for dark mode:**

The polarity factor is the key. In dark themes, most text is light-on-dark (negative
polarity). The factor reduces the effective contrast score, meaning the derivation
engine must push foreground tones further from the surface to achieve the same
threshold. This naturally produces higher ΔL for dark-mode text — exactly the
behavior needed for dark-mode legibility.

**Why not just WCAG 2.x ratio?**

The WCAG 2.x formula `(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)` is symmetric — it reports the same
ratio regardless of polarity. This is why dark themes routinely have legibility
problems despite "passing" WCAG: the formula doesn't account for the polarity
disadvantage. We keep WCAG ratio as informational display data but do not use it as
a gate.

## Part 2: Purge Third-Party Terminology

### Problem

The codebase references APCA, SAPC, SACAM, SA98G, and "Lc" (as a branded metric
name) throughout source code, tests, plans, and roadmap docs. These terms are
trademarked and their use is restricted by license. We need zero association.

## Part 3: De-duplicate Formula Constants

### Problem

The `DerivationFormulas` interface encodes formulas at the wrong level of
specificity. The interface has fields like:

```typescript
outlinedActionFgRestTone: number;   // 100
outlinedActionFgHoverTone: number;  // 100
outlinedActionFgActiveTone: number; // 100
outlinedActionFgRestI: number;      // 2
outlinedActionFgHoverI: number;     // 2
outlinedActionFgActiveI: number;    // 2
outlinedActionIconRestTone: number; // 100
outlinedActionIconHoverTone: number;// 100
outlinedActionIconActiveTone: number;// 100
outlinedActionIconRestI: number;    // 2
outlinedActionIconHoverI: number;   // 2
outlinedActionIconActiveI: number;  // 2

outlinedAgentFgRestTone: number;    // 100  ← same
outlinedAgentFgHoverTone: number;   // 100  ← same
outlinedAgentFgActiveTone: number;  // 100  ← same
outlinedAgentFgRestI: number;       // 2    ← same
outlinedAgentFgHoverI: number;      // 2    ← same
outlinedAgentFgActiveI: number;     // 2    ← same
outlinedAgentIconRestTone: number;  // 100  ← same
outlinedAgentIconHoverTone: number; // 100  ← same
outlinedAgentIconActiveTone: number;// 100  ← same
outlinedAgentIconRestI: number;     // 2    ← same
outlinedAgentIconHoverI: number;    // 2    ← same
outlinedAgentIconActiveI: number;   // 2    ← same

outlinedOptionFgRestTone: number;   // 100  ← same
// ... 12 more identical fields
```

That's **36 fields** to express **one formula**: "outlined fg/icon uses tone 100,
intensity 2, for all states." The light-mode variants add 18 more fields — all zero.
The same pattern repeats for ghost emphasis. Every role (action, agent, option) gets
its own copy of the same numbers.

This is the core duplication: **the formula varies by emphasis (filled, outlined,
ghost), not by role (action, agent, danger).** Role only determines which hue slot
to use — the tone/intensity/alpha formula is identical across roles within an
emphasis. But the interface encodes role × emphasis × state × property as individual
named fields, producing massive duplication.

The factory functions in `derivation-rules.ts` (`filledRoleRules`,
`outlinedFgRules`, `badgeTintedRoleRules`) correctly factor out the rule structure —
they define the pattern once and apply it to each role. But they construct formula
field names dynamically (`outlined${capitalRole}Fg${state}Tone`), which forces the
interface to have a separate field for every role even when all roles use the same
value. The abstraction is in the rules but not in the data.

### The numbers

Current state of `DerivationFormulas`:

| Emphasis | Fields per role | Roles | Total fields | Unique values |
|----------|----------------:|------:|-------------:|--------------:|
| Outlined fg/icon tones+I | 12 | 3 | 36 | 4 (tone=100, I=2, toneLt=0, ILt=0) |
| Outlined fg/icon light | 12 | 3 | 18* | 1 (all zero) |
| Ghost (similar pattern) | varies | 3 | ~20 | ~4 |
| Badge tinted | 6 | 1 | 6 | 6 (shared across all 7 roles) |
| Filled bg tones | 3 | 1 | 3 | 3 (shared across all 7 roles) |
| Semantic tone | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 (shared across all 7 roles) |

\* The light-mode outlined fields are a separate set of per-role fields on top of the
dark-mode ones.

The filled and badge factories already work correctly — they read emphasis-level
fields (`filledBgDarkTone`, `badgeTintedFgI`) that are shared across all roles. The
duplication is concentrated in outlined and ghost, where the factory constructs
role-specific field names.

### Solution: Emphasis-level formulas

The formula interface should define values at the emphasis level, not the role level.
The factory function takes the role's hue slot but reads shared emphasis fields:

**Before** — 36 fields for 4 unique values:

```typescript
// DerivationFormulas (current)
outlinedActionFgRestTone: 100,
outlinedActionFgHoverTone: 100,
outlinedActionFgActiveTone: 100,
outlinedActionFgRestI: 2,
outlinedActionFgHoverI: 2,
outlinedActionFgActiveI: 2,
outlinedAgentFgRestTone: 100,   // ← duplicate
outlinedAgentFgHoverTone: 100,  // ← duplicate
// ... 28 more identical fields
```

**After** — 4 fields for 4 values:

```typescript
// DerivationFormulas (new)
outlinedFgRestTone: 100,
outlinedFgHoverTone: 100,
outlinedFgActiveTone: 100,
outlinedFgI: 2,
```

The factory function changes from:

```typescript
// Before: constructs role-specific field names
function outlinedFgRules(role: string, hueSlot: string) {
  const capitalRole = role.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + role.slice(1);
  function fgToneExpr(state: "Rest" | "Hover" | "Active"): Expr {
    const field = `outlined${capitalRole}Fg${state}Tone` as keyof DerivationFormulas;
    return (formulas) => formulas[field] as number;
  }
  // ... 12 tokens, each reading a role-specific field
}
```

To:

```typescript
// After: reads emphasis-level fields, role only provides hue slot
function outlinedFgRules(role: string, hueSlot: string) {
  return {
    [`--tug-base-control-outlined-${role}-fg-rest`]: {
      type: "chromatic", hueSlot: "txt",
      intensityExpr: (f) => f.outlinedFgI,
      toneExpr: (f) => f.outlinedFgRestTone,
    },
    // ... same formula for all roles, only the token name and hueSlot vary
  };
}
```

**Field count reduction:**

| Area | Before | After | Reduction |
|------|-------:|------:|----------:|
| Outlined fg/icon (dark) | 36 | 8 | -28 |
| Outlined fg/icon (light) | 18 | 4 | -14 |
| Ghost fg/icon (similar) | ~20 | ~6 | ~-14 |
| **Total** | **~74** | **~18** | **~-56** |

The `DerivationFormulas` interface shrinks by roughly half. More importantly: when
you change the outlined fg tone, it changes for all roles at once. No more updating
3 identical values and hoping you don't miss one. **Duplicated formulas that fail to
refer back to a common declaration are bugs** — this eliminates that class of bug.

### Per-role overrides (escape hatch)

If a specific role genuinely needs a different value — say outlined-option borders
use neutral tones instead of role-colored tones (this already exists) — the formula
interface can have a targeted override field:

```typescript
outlinedFgI: 2,                      // default for all outlined roles
outlinedOptionBorderRestTone: 50,    // override: option borders are neutral
outlinedOptionBorderHoverTone: 55,
outlinedOptionBorderActiveTone: 60,
```

The factory checks for the override first, falls back to the emphasis-level default.
This is the existing pattern for `outlinedOptionBorderRules()` — it already overrides
the border formulas for option specifically. The difference is that the override is
now an explicit exception rather than the default encoding.

### Additional cleanup: defaults + override pattern

Beyond the emphasis-level consolidation, the recipe system needs a base-defaults
mechanism for theme families:

```typescript
/** Base formula defaults — shared across all recipes. */
const BASE_FORMULAS: DerivationFormulas = {
  bgAppTone: 5,
  outlinedFgI: 2,
  outlinedFgRestTone: 100,
  // ... all fields with sensible defaults
};

/** Brio dark/stark: only the fields that differ. */
const BRIO_DARK_STARK_OVERRIDES: Partial<DerivationFormulas> = {
  fgDefaultTone: 98,
  fgSubtleTone: 45,
};

export const BRIO_DARK_STARK_FORMULAS: DerivationFormulas = {
  ...BASE_FORMULAS,
  ...BRIO_DARK_STARK_OVERRIDES,
};
```

And: audit all inline constants in `deriveTheme()` and friends. Every numeric
constant must either be in `DerivationFormulas` (if recipe-dependent) or be a named
constant with a JSDoc comment. No magic numbers in the derivation pipeline.

---

## Part 4: Contrast-Aware Derivation (Eliminate Auto-Fix)

### Problem

`autoAdjustContrast` is a post-hoc iterative fixer that tries to repair contrast
failures after derivation. It reports 33 failures and 31 "unfixable" on Brio.
Three bugs make it structurally broken:

**Bug A: Ignores parentSurface compositing.** The validation pass composites
semi-transparent surfaces correctly, but auto-fix measures contrast without
compositing. It gets the wrong number, computes the wrong bump direction, and
oscillates. Affects ~24 pairings.

**Bug B: Tries to bump black/white/alpha tokens.** Shadow/scrim/highlight tokens
are structurally fixed. `parseTugColorToken` parses them but `baseHueName` falls
back to "violet", producing nonsense tone math.

**Bug C: Can only adjust foregrounds, never surfaces.** `fg-onAccent` is white
text on a colored background — the fix needs the background to change, but
auto-fix only touches foreground tokens.

### Solution: Contrast floors in the derivation engine

Instead of deriving tokens and then fixing them, make the derivation engine
contrast-aware. After computing each foreground token's tone, check it against all
paired surfaces and enforce a minimum contrast floor.

The derivation engine already knows all surface tones (it just computed them) and
has access to the pairing map:

```typescript
function enforceContrastFloor(
  elementL: number,
  surfaceL: number,
  threshold: number,
  polarity: "lighter" | "darker",
): number {
  // Binary search for the minimum element L
  // that produces perceptual contrast >= threshold against surfaceL
}
```

For each foreground token, after computing its initial tone:
1. Look up all surfaces it's paired against (from the pairing map)
2. For each surface, compute the minimum tone needed to pass the threshold
3. Take the most restrictive
4. If the initial tone doesn't meet the floor, clamp it

This makes auto-fix unnecessary. The derivation engine produces compliant tokens by
construction. The contrast dashboard still displays results, but with 0 failures
because there is nothing to fix.

### Tokens to skip

Structurally fixed tokens are excluded from contrast floor enforcement:

- `--tug-color(black, ...)` — shadow/scrim overlays
- `--tug-color(white, ...)` — highlight overlays
- `--tug-color(transparent)` — no contrast meaning
- Any token with `alpha < 100` where contrast depends on compositing

### Theme family implications

Contrast-aware derivation is what makes theme families viable. A "stark" profile can
set higher contrast thresholds and the derivation engine will automatically push
foreground tones to meet them. A "soft" profile can relax thresholds for subdued text.
The formulas define the aesthetic intent; the contrast floors guarantee legibility.

This is exactly how the word game themes work: dark, light, dark/stark, and
light/stark are four profiles from one color input, with the "stark" variants
producing higher-contrast, more outlined designs. The derivation engine ensures each
variant meets its own contrast requirements by construction.

### Diagnostic output

Replace the current `unfixable: string[]` with structured diagnostics:

```typescript
interface ContrastDiagnostic {
  token: string;
  reason: "floor-applied" | "structurally-fixed" | "composite-dependent";
  surfaces: string[];
  initialTone: number;
  finalTone: number;
  threshold: number;
}
```
