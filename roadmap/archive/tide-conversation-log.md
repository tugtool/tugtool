I want to get back to this topic, and expand on it. Here's what I'm thinking.

The notion of "building a graphical Claude Code conversation experience" remains a goal, but actually, it doesn't go far enough. Think about the command line experience with
terminals on a typical Unix machine. In essence, their user experience traces its roots back to the 19th century and teleprinters, with a modern reimagining closely tied to DEC
VT100 terminals from the 1970s. Typing commands in as clipped text and getting minimally-formatted text responses was the outisde limit of what the tech could do. Over time, the
`tty` became an widely-adopted user interface standard, and has proved to be so successful and so durable that every Linux, Mac, and Unix-like computer offers `pty`
(pseudo-terminals) as a standard user interface, and serves as the main "low-level" means we humand have for telling the computer what we want it to do. Millions of people every
day continue to use shells like the Bourne shell (sh), Bash, and Z shell (zsh) to get work done.

Anthropic also took the curious step to adopt the terminal as the user interface for Claude Code—and this turned out to be a brilliant master stroke: since the terminal is all
about text, and so are LLMs, text-only terminal usage patterns and conventions turned out to be an excellent way to use AI assistance to do work, including complex software
development work.

So here I am this morning, typing commands in a terminal to, not only list files and change directories and launch programs, but also to call on incredibly sophisticated AI systems
 to help me write software and make my product ideas come alive. This is great, but I think we can do better.

Yes, I want to to pursue better Claude Code conversations, but I want to achieve this by improving the entirety of text-based terminal interactions by joining graphically-rich user
 interface experience.

If you think about it, command lines on Unix-like computers have two parts we don't typically separate in our minds: the tty/pty and the command interpreter. I want to divide
these, leave the tty/pty part behind, and provide a graphical foundation layer for people to use for command interpreters. This means both the shells (like sh, Bash, and zsh), but
*also* for Claude Code.

That's the real goal here. So again, I ask you to read back up on these documents. We need to extract the "protocol" aspect that we've already investigated and plotted out for
communicating with Claude Code, note that down, add additional research for how this informs how we might expand this concept to encompass shell command line interpreters, and make
 a new roadmap to accomplish all this. As we continue to discuss, we're going to need to do more research about tty/pty, shells, command line interpreters, and then fold in our
progress on tugcast, tugtalk, and the budding Claude Code protocol in a way that can be a part of this new landscape I just described.

Make sense? Dig in. Investigate. Tell me what you think.

  This is a genuinely ambitious idea, and I think it's sound. Let me lay out what I see.

  The Core Insight

  You've identified that the terminal bundles two things that should be separate:

  1. The rendering surface — the tty/pty/VT100 emulator that converts a byte stream into visible characters on screen
  2. The command interpreter — the shell (bash, zsh) or tool (Claude Code) that accepts commands and produces output

  The terminal conflates these because historically they had to be the same thing. A teleprinter was both the display and the interaction medium. The VT100 was both the screen and
  the protocol. The pty kernel abstraction perpetuates this: it's a bidirectional byte pipe where everything — keystrokes, output text, cursor positioning, color, even images — must
   serialize into one untyped byte stream.

  Claude Code already broke free of this with --output-format stream-json. It doesn't need the pty. It speaks a typed protocol: structured JSON events with semantic meaning
  (assistant_text, tool_use, cost_update, control_request_forward). The transport exploration documents 35 tests worth of evidence for this. The tugcast WebSocket layer adds a
  binary framing protocol on top. You have the beginnings of a post-terminal architecture already built.

  What You've Already Proven

  From the four documents, here's the protocol stack you've established:

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Claude Code (stream-json mode)                     │
  │  Protocol: JSON-lines over stdin/stdout              │

  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  This stack handles Claude Code. The question is: can the same stack host a traditional shell?

  Two Adapters, One Surface

  The answer is yes, but the shell needs a different adapter than Claude Code. Here's why:

  Claude Code speaks a structured protocol. Every event has a type, semantic fields, and a clear lifecycle (turn_start → streaming → turn_complete). The graphical UI can render
  rich, purpose-built components for each event type: markdown for assistant text, file viewers for Read results, approval dialogs for permissions.

  A shell (bash, zsh) speaks the pty byte stream. Output is ANSI-escaped text. There's no structure — just bytes that a VT100 emulator knows how to paint into a character grid. ls
  output, git log, htop, vim — they all produce the same kind of output: escape sequences interspersed with text.

  So the architecture needs two adapters:

  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │                    Graphical Surface                        │
  │         (tugdeck / native view / unified output)           │
  │                                                            │
  │  ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────────────────┐  │

  │  └──────┬───────────┘    └──────┬───────────────────────┘  │
  │         │ pty                    │ stdio/WebSocket          │
  │  ┌──────▼───────────┐    ┌──────▼───────────────────────┐  │
  │  │  bash / zsh       │    │  Claude Code                  │  │
  │  │  (unmodified)     │    │  (stream-json mode)           │  │
  │  └──────────────────┘    └──────────────────────────────┘  │
  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  The shell adapter is essentially a terminal emulator embedded in your graphical surface — like xterm.js or a native grid renderer. The Claude Code adapter is what
  tug-conversation.md already designs: semantic rendering of typed events.

  The Interesting Territory

  The really interesting part isn't just running these side by side. It's the interactions between them:

  1. Shell output can feed into Claude Code context. You run cargo build in the shell pane, it fails. The graphical layer can capture that output (it's rendering it, so it has it)
  and offer "ask Claude about this error" — piping the terminal output as context into a Claude Code message.
  2. Claude Code tool calls can render in the shell. When Claude calls Bash, the output currently comes back as a tool_result text blob. But if the graphical surface also has a
  terminal emulator, it could render that Bash output with full ANSI fidelity — colors, formatting, the way it would look in a real terminal.
  3. A unified command line. The prompt input could dispatch to either the shell or Claude Code based on context. Type ls and it goes to bash. Type a natural language question and
  it goes to Claude. The / prefix already disambiguates slash commands; you could extend that convention.
  4. The tug-feed layer spans both. The feed architecture from tug-feed.md captures agent lifecycle events. The same feed could capture shell commands — command started, output,
  exit code, duration. Unified observability across human commands and AI actions.

  What This Means for the Roadmap

  The existing tug-conversation.md roadmap is still valid — it's building the Claude Code adapter side of this. But the expanded vision adds:

  - A terminal emulator component — either xterm.js for the web (tugdeck), or a native terminal view for tugapp. This is the shell adapter. It needs to integrate with the same
  unified scroll/output surface.
  - A session model that encompasses both shell sessions and Claude Code sessions — with the ability to interleave them, pass context between them, and present them in a unified
  timeline.
  - A protocol abstraction layer — tugcast already multiplexes feeds via FeedId. A shell session could be another feed (the 0x00 TerminalOutput feed already exists!). The
  infrastructure for carrying shell bytes alongside Claude Code JSON over the same WebSocket is already built.

  That last point is key. Tugcast's TerminalOutput feed (FeedId 0x00) already carries raw terminal bytes from the tmux session. You've been sending shell output over WebSocket this
  whole time — it's just been the tmux session backing Claude Code's terminal, not a user-facing shell. The architecture generalizes naturally.

  Open Questions for Discussion

  1. Interaction model: Is this two panes (shell + Claude Code side by side)? Or one unified stream where shell commands and Claude Code turns interleave like a single conversation?
   Warp's "blocks" model does the latter for shell output — each command is a discrete block.
  2. Shell modification: Do you want an unmodified bash/zsh (maximum compatibility, but you only get pty bytes), or are you willing to hook the shell (like Warp's shell integration
  scripts) to get structured metadata — command boundaries, exit codes, working directory changes, command duration?
  3. Tugcast vs. local: For the Mac app (tugapp), does the shell adapter go through tugcast, or does the Swift app spawn the pty directly? Tugcast adds latency; for a local shell,
  direct pty might be better. Claude Code already goes through tugcast because tugtalk is the bridge.
  4. Scope of the first cut: The full vision is large. What's the minimum that demonstrates the concept? My instinct says: a tugdeck view that shows a terminal emulator (shell
  adapter) alongside the Claude Code conversation, with the ability to copy shell output into a Claude Code prompt. That alone would be a significant step.

  What's your thinking on these? I want to make sure the roadmap we write serves the real vision, not just the Claude Code conversation piece.

✻ Brewed for 2m 34s

❯ But you see, I *explicity don't want* to just bolt on a new-fangled pty. I want to get rid of this antiquated layer in the architecture. There is *nothing* interesting about it.

A shell (bash, zsh) speaks the pty byte stream. Output is ANSI-escaped text. There's no structure — just bytes that a VT100 emulator knows how to paint into a character grid. ls
output, git log, htop, vim — they all produce the same kind of output: escape sequences interspersed with text.

My idea is to *adapt* all these outputs so we can produce a fully re-imagined graphical version of ls output, git log, htop.... and maybe even vim. Get what I'm saying? The
ANSI-escaped text is so limited in what it can actually do, right? Seriously, it's been years now, but I've looked at tty-emulation code, and it's a mishmash of antiquated ideas
about long-obsolete hardware mixed in with just the minimum of things we would need to know to provide true and rich graphical output.

So yes, would there be programs my concept would need to leave behind? Yes. Maybe vim. Maybe even htop. But the benefit would be to begin breaking the bonds we no longer actually
need. We have graphical text editors. We have graphical activity monitors. I don't want to continue being weighed down by them.


⏺ I do get what you're saying. And it's a sharper idea than what I initially reflected back.

  You're not saying "put a terminal emulator next to Claude Code." You're saying: the VT100 character grid is an output device we no longer need. Replace it.

  The Real Architecture

  The pty exists because programs need somewhere to write. They call write(1, ...) to stdout and expect something to consume those bytes. Today that something is a terminal emulator
   that paints a character grid. Your idea is: that something should be a graphical rendering layer that understands what the program was trying to say, not one that simulates 1978
  hardware.

  For Claude Code, you've already done this. Claude Code speaks stream-json. Tugtalk bridges it to tugcast. Tugdeck renders semantic UI. No VT100 involved. The protocol is typed,
  the rendering is rich, and the result is better than any terminal could produce.

  The move is to do the same thing for the shell and its ecosystem of commands.

  Today:
    bash → pty → VT100 emulator → character grid
    Claude Code → pty → VT100 emulator → character grid

  What you've already built:
    Claude Code → stream-json → tugtalk → tugcast → tugdeck (rich UI)

  The vision:
    bash → shell bridge → tugcast → tugdeck (rich UI)
    ls   → recognized → file listing component (icons, metadata, sorting)
    git log → recognized → commit graph component (clickable, filterable)
    cargo build → recognized → build output component (errors linked to source)
    unknown-cmd → fallback → styled monospace text block (no VT100 parsing)

  The pty doesn't disappear as plumbing — bash/zsh check isatty() and refuse to run interactively without a tty. So the shell bridge holds a pty internally as a compatibility shim.
  But the pty is buried implementation detail, like a device driver. The user never sees a character grid. The VT100 escape sequences are never interpreted as rendering
  instructions. They're either stripped or, for known commands, the bridge doesn't even look at them — it runs a structured equivalent instead.

  What the Shell Bridge Does

  Call it tugshell (or whatever). It's the analog of tugtalk. Tugtalk bridges Claude Code's stream-json to tugcast. Tugshell bridges bash/zsh to tugcast.

  Command awareness is the key capability. Tugshell uses shell integration hooks — zsh has preexec and precmd, bash has PROMPT_COMMAND and DEBUG traps. These fire before and after
  every command. So tugshell knows:

  - What command is about to run (name, arguments, full command line)
  - When it started
  - When it finished
  - The exit code
  - The working directory before and after
  - The captured stdout and stderr

  With that metadata, tugshell can dispatch:

  └─────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  The critical point: for recognized commands, tugshell doesn't even need to parse the pty output. It can run a structured variant of the command. Instead of capturing ls -la output
   and trying to parse columns, it can call stat() on the directory entries itself and produce a structured JSON event. Instead of parsing git log text, it runs git log
  --format='{"hash":"%H","author":"%an",...}'. The raw command the user typed is the intent; the bridge fulfills that intent through whatever means produces the best structured
  data.

  What You Lose (and Why That's Fine)

  Full-screen curses programs: vim, htop, less, top, tmux. These programs take over the entire terminal — they rely on raw pty mode, cursor addressing, and the character grid as a
  canvas. They are fundamentally VT100-native applications.

  But as you said: we have graphical text editors. We have graphical activity monitors. We have graphical file managers. The programs that need VT100 are programs that were forced
  into VT100 because there was no graphical alternative in the terminal. In a graphical surface, they'd be native components.

  And the programs people actually run most — ls, cd, git, cargo, npm, grep, cat, echo, curl, make — are all command-response programs that produce line-oriented output. They don't
  need the character grid. They never did.

  The Protocol Layer

  Here's where your existing infrastructure pays off. Tugcast already multiplexes multiple feeds over one WebSocket with binary framing. Today:

  ┌───────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  FeedId   │                   Feed                   │

  │ 0x41      │ CodeInput (to Claude Code)               │
  └───────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘

  The expanded model:

  ┌────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ FeedId │                Feed                │
  ├────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤

  ├────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 0x51   │ ShellInput (commands to shell)     │
  ├────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ 0x60   │ TugFeed (agent progress events)    │
  └────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘

  ShellOutput events would be typed JSON — the same pattern as Claude Code's stream-json:

  { "type": "command_start", "id": "cmd-42", "command": "git status", "cwd": "/src/tugtool" }
  { "type": "command_output", "id": "cmd-42", "format": "git_status", "data": { "staged": [...], "unstaged": [...] } }
  { "type": "command_complete", "id": "cmd-42", "exit_code": 0, "duration_ms": 45 }

  For unrecognized commands:
  { "type": "command_output", "id": "cmd-99", "format": "text", "data": { "text": "some plain output\n" } }

  The graphical surface renders format: "git_status" as a rich component and format: "text" as styled monospace. Same surface, same protocol, same rendering pipeline. Claude Code
  conversation blocks and shell command blocks are siblings in the output stream.

  The Unified Experience

  This is what gets exciting. In this model, the user's workspace is a single graphical surface where:

  1. They type git status and see a rich, interactive file status display
  2. They type cargo build and see structured build output with clickable error locations
  3. They type a natural language prompt and Claude Code responds with streamed markdown, tool use blocks, permission dialogs
  4. Claude Code runs cargo build as a tool call and the output renders with the same rich component as when the user ran it manually
  5. The user copies a build error from their shell command and drops it into a Claude Code prompt
  6. The tug-feed layer captures all of it — shell commands and agent actions — in one unified timeline

  There's no "terminal pane" and "AI pane." There's one surface where humans and AI both issue commands and see results, rendered at the full fidelity of a graphical UI.

  What Needs Research Next

  1. Shell integration depth: How much can we learn from zsh's preexec/precmd hooks? Can we reliably get the command line, arguments parsed, and pipe structure? What about
  subshells, backgrounded processes, shell functions?
  2. Command adapter coverage: How many commands cover 80% of real usage? My guess is ~20 commands get you most of the way. What's the long tail look like?
  3. The fallback story: When an unrecognized command produces ANSI-escaped output, how much do we strip vs. interpret? Simple SGR colors (bold, red text) could be mapped to CSS
  styles without a full VT100 emulator. That might be the pragmatic middle ground.
  4. Pipe and redirection semantics: ls | grep foo — does tugshell intercept both commands? Just the final output? How does it handle the pipeline?
  5. Existing art in structured shell output: Nushell's structured pipeline, PowerShell's object model, and the Jupyter kernel protocol are the closest precedents. Worth studying
  their command-to-structured-output mapping strategies.

  Want to dig into any of these, or should we start sketching the roadmap document that brings this together with the existing tug-conversation work?

Yes! Now you're getting the idea!

Think about it this way. Our Claude Code investigations showed that many commands fall into the "UI Must Build" section. Quite a few, actually. Now, consider this observation you
just made:

"And the programs people actually run most — ls, cd, git, cargo, npm, grep, cat, echo, curl, make — are all command-response programs that produce line-oriented output. They don't
need the character grid. They never did."

Exactly! We expand out the set of "UI Must Build" component to *encompass* these most often-used commands. This is the basis for the "one surface where humans and AI both issue
commands and see results". For all the commands we want to bring onto the "single surface", we do a version of what we did for Claude Code: we investigate to map out its inputs and
 outputs and we use or expand the protocol (if needed) to bring them in.

"The pty doesn't disappear as plumbing... [it's a] buried implementation detail, like a device driver." Suits me fine. We should build in this notion, and make a design
decision—perhaps even a new #law-of-tug—that this detail never leaks out to the user in any way.

Now, yes, of course we can also offer a bog-standard terminal card in tugdeck. We already have a `terminal.rs` file in tugcast to serve as the basis of this. If a user really wants
 `vim` just as they like it, they can get it, but that isn't part of the "single surface".

How does this sound?


What Needs Research Next, with my responses:

 backgrounded processes, shell functions?

2. Command adapter coverage: How many commands cover 80% of real usage? My guess is ~20 commands get you most of the way. What's the long tail look like?
➤ RESPONSE: We need this too. My experience with everything on computers is that this long tail never goes away, but that the "fat part under the curve" that we actually care about
 isn't too daunting.

3. The fallback story: When an unrecognized command produces ANSI-escaped output, how much do we strip vs. interpret? Simple SGR colors (bold, red text) could be mapped to CSS
styles without a full VT100 emulator. That might be the pragmatic middle ground.
➤ RESPONSE: Yes. We can provide an interpretation layer for sure, and make some sensible decisions about `strip vs. interpret`. This should be expandable and revisable as we
progress and learn.

4. Pipe and redirection semantics: ls | grep foo — does tugshell intercept both commands? Just the final output? How does it handle the pipeline?
➤ RESPONSE: This would be so very cool. We really must do this. These command-line semantics might be the feature that gets people to treat this new system as good enough to use.

5. Existing art in structured shell output: Nushell's structured pipeline, PowerShell's object model, and the Jupyter kernel protocol are the closest precedents. Worth studying
their command-to-structured-output mapping strategies.
➤ RESPONSE: Absolutely need to do research on this. However, we must limit our investigations to avoid all license encumbrance. No GPL code at all. MIT license (or compatible) as
the basic standard.

  Responding to Your Feedback

  First, the law-of-tug idea: yes, absolutely. Something like:

  ▎ [Lxx] The pty boundary is opaque. The graphical surface never exposes terminal emulation artifacts to the user. No VT100 character grids, no ANSI escape sequence rendering, no
  cursor-addressable screens. A hidden pty may exist as OS-level plumbing for shell compatibility, but its byte stream is consumed by adapters that produce typed, structured output
  events. If a program's output cannot be meaningfully adapted, it renders as styled monospace text — never as a terminal emulator viewport.

  And the escape hatch: the terminal card in tugdeck remains available as a separate, explicit opt-in for the programs that truly need it. But it's off to the side, not part of the
  unified surface. Clean separation.

  What the Research Shows

  Shell Integration: We Can Get What We Need

  The hooks are well-understood and battle-tested. Zsh's preexec gives us the full command string before execution. precmd gives us the exit code and cwd after. Duration is trivial
  (timestamp delta). iTerm2, Warp, and VS Code all use the same OSC 133 marker technique to delimit command blocks — this is a solved pattern.

  What we get reliably: the full command line as typed, exit code (including per-stage via pipestatus), duration, working directory before/after.

  What we don't get from hooks alone: a parsed AST of the command. Hooks hand us a string. Detecting pipes, redirections, and subshells requires parsing that string ourselves. This
  is doable for the common cases (splitting on |, detecting >, 2>&1) and gets fragile at the edges (heredocs, nested quoting). The pragmatic path: parse what we can, fall back
  gracefully when we can't.

  The bash DEBUG trap is interesting — it fires per simple command in a pipeline, giving us individual command names. But it's noisy and requires deduplication logic. Zsh's preexec
  (one call per command line) is cleaner for our model.

  Command Coverage: ~20 Commands Covers 80%

  The data is clear. Developer shell usage is heavily concentrated:

  - git alone is 15-25% of all commands. Git has excellent structured output: --porcelain, --format=<custom>, and for many subcommands, JSON-compatible formats. This is the
  highest-value adapter by far.
  - The top 10 commands (git, cd, ls, cat, grep, docker, npm/yarn, cargo, make, vim) cover roughly 55-65% of usage.
  - ~19-22 commands with structured adapters would cover 80%+ of a developer's interactions.

  Many of these already speak structured output natively:

  ┌────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────┐
  │        Category        │                              Commands                               │                Notes                 │

  │ Stable parseable       │ git (porcelain), ls, grep/rg, find, ps, diff, wc, du/df             │ Well-known formats, reliable parsing │

  ├────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Free-form text         │ make, echo, python, cat, tail/head                                  │ Styled monospace fallback            │

  │ Full-screen (excluded) │ vim, htop, less, top, ssh                                           │ Terminal card only                   │
  └────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘

  The key insight from the research: we don't need to parse VT100 output for any of these. For Category A commands, we ask for JSON. For Category B, we parse stable text formats.
  For Category C, we render the raw text as styled monospace. For Category D, we punt to the terminal card.

  Structured Shell Precedents: The Gap Nobody Fills

  The research across Nushell, PowerShell, Jupyter, and Warp reveals a consistent pattern:

  - Nushell (MIT): Structured pipelines internally, but external commands produce raw ByteStream. The user must explicitly pipe through from json or lines to get structure. No
  auto-detection.
  - PowerShell (MIT): Object pipeline internally, external commands produce string[]. Same explicit boundary.
  - Jupyter (BSD): The multi-representation pattern is the most relevant design idea. One result carries multiple MIME types (text/plain, text/html, application/json). The frontend
  picks the richest format it can render.
  - Warp (proprietary, concepts only): Block model with OSC 133 boundaries. Proves that treating each command as a discrete object with metadata works commercially.

  The gap: nobody auto-adapts known external command output into structured data. Every system treats external commands as opaque text. Our adapter registry would be the first to
  bridge this — recognizing git status and producing structured data automatically, without the user needing to say from json.

  Pipes: The Hybrid Approach Works

  For pipelines like ls | grep foo | wc -l:

  1. Run the full pipeline natively through the hidden pty. Don't try to intercept intermediate stages.
  2. Parse the command string from preexec to understand the pipeline topology — what commands are involved, what the user was trying to do.
  3. Render the final output with knowledge of the full pipeline. If we recognize the pattern, render richly. If not, styled monospace.
  4. For redirections (> file.txt), detect them by parsing the command string and show an annotation ("Output written to file.txt") rather than rendering nothing.
  5. Use pipestatus/PIPESTATUS to show per-stage exit codes on failure.

  This preserves full Unix compatibility. Every existing command and pipeline works. But recognized patterns get progressive enhancement. Over time, the adapter registry grows, and
  more patterns get rich rendering.

  The Nushell model (structured pipelines end-to-end) is more powerful but breaks compatibility. Our approach is the opposite: full compatibility first, progressive richness on top.
   A user can paste any command from Stack Overflow and it works. But their daily commands — git, cargo, ls, grep — look and feel like native graphical applications.

  The Adapter Architecture

  Pulling all this together, the adapter model has three layers:

  Layer 1: Shell Bridge (tugshell)
    - Spawns bash/zsh with hidden pty
    - Injects shell integration hooks (preexec/precmd + OSC markers)
    - Captures: command string, exit code, duration, cwd, stdout bytes
    - Emits structured events to tugcast

  Layer 2: Command Adapter Registry
    - Maps (command_name, args) → adapter function
    - Adapter receives: command string, raw stdout, exit code
    - Adapter produces: typed output event with format tag + structured data
    - Fallback: format="text", data={ text: raw_stdout }
    - Some adapters bypass stdout entirely (e.g., git status adapter
      runs git2 or git --porcelain directly for cleaner data)

  Layer 3: Graphical Renderers (tugdeck)
    - Maps format tag → UI component
    - "git_status" → GitStatusBlock (staged/unstaged lists, actions)
    - "file_listing" → FileListBlock (icons, metadata columns, sorting)
    - "build_output" → BuildBlock (errors linked to source, warnings)
    - "text" → MonospaceBlock (styled, ANSI colors mapped to CSS)
    - Same renderer pipeline as Claude Code conversation blocks

  The protocol event for a shell command would look like:

  {
    "type": "command_start",
    "id": "cmd-42",
    "command": "git status",
    "cwd": "/src/tugtool",
    "timestamp": "2026-04-02T10:30:00Z"
  }
  {
    "type": "command_output",
    "id": "cmd-42",
    "format": "git_status",
    "data": {
      "branch": "main",
      "staged": [{"path": "src/lib.rs", "status": "modified"}],
      "unstaged": [{"path": "README.md", "status": "modified"}],
      "untracked": ["new-file.txt"]
    }
  }
  {
    "type": "command_complete",
    "id": "cmd-42",
    "exit_code": 0,
    "duration_ms": 45,
    "pipestatus": [0]
  }

  And this sits alongside Claude Code events on the same surface:

  { "type": "assistant_text", "text": "I'll fix that bug...", "is_partial": true }
  { "type": "tool_use", "tool_name": "Edit", "input": { "file_path": "src/lib.rs", ... } }

  Same tugcast WebSocket. Same tugdeck rendering pipeline. Same unified surface. Shell commands and Claude Code turns are both blocks in one stream, each rendered at full graphical
  fidelity.

  Ready to start sketching the roadmap document. The existing tug-conversation.md phases (transport, markdown rendering, conversation wiring) remain the Claude Code half. We need to
   add the shell half alongside it, and reframe the whole thing under this unified vision. Want me to go ahead?

🢁 Almost. First of all, this direction is fantastic. Now, I want to add a couple more thoughts into the mix before you go ahead and reframe.

1. We have this notion of Claude Code commands we "send on through" to the Ai for its response. We then have these "UI Must Build" command that we need to handle at the level (or
mostly handle) above the level of protocol-routing complexity. How do we "bake in" this idea. How does it relate to what shells do with their "built-in" commands?

2. Should probably read and understand the man pages for the major shells. *Decades* of development, experience, and lineage to learn from and adapt.

3. What is the `environment` for our "single surface"? What's the `cwd`? What `variables` or `aliases` or `functions` or `startup files` do we allow?

4. What is the name for this effort? "tug-conversation" and "single surface" don't quite cover it. I also had the idea of "graphical terminal" and "tide (Tug IDE)", but I'm not
sure how well any of these work perfectly. Tell me what you think.


⏺ Great additions. Let me take these one at a time.

  1. Built-in Commands: The Three-Tier Dispatch Model

  This is a sharp observation. There's a direct parallel between how shells handle built-ins and how we need to handle the "UI Must Build" commands.

  In bash/zsh, commands dispatch to three tiers:

  ┌────────────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │      Tier      │    Shell Example     │                             What Happens                              │
  ├────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Built-in       │ cd, export, alias    │ Shell handles directly. Never spawns a process. Modifies shell state. │
  ├────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Function/alias │ User-defined ll, gst │ Expanded/evaluated by the shell, may call built-ins or externals.     │
  ├────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ External       │ git, cargo, ls       │ Shell forks, execs the binary. Output comes back over the pipe.       │
  └────────────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  Our unified surface has the same three tiers, but with two command interpreters (shell and Claude Code) behind it:

  ┌────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────┬────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │        Tier        │                    Our Example                    │                                            What Happens                                            │
  ├────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Surface built-in   │ Model switcher, permission mode, cost display,    │ Handled entirely by the graphical surface. Never reaches shell or Claude Code. Modifies surface    │
  │                    │ clear, theme, session management                  │ state. These are the "UI Must Build" items (U9-U11, C1-C8, C11-C15).                               │
  ├────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Claude Code        │ Natural language prompts, /plan, /implement,      │ Routed to Claude Code via the stream-json protocol. Events stream back.                            │
  │ pass-through       │ /compact                                          │                                                                                                    │
  ├────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
  │ Shell pass-through │ git status, cargo build, ls, pipes                │ Routed to the shell via tugshell. Adapter produces structured output.                              │
  └────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  The surface built-ins are the exact analog of shell built-ins. cd in bash doesn't spawn a process — it modifies the shell's own state. Our model switcher doesn't talk to Claude
  Code or the shell — it modifies the surface's own state and sends a model_change message as a side effect. The cost display reads from cached cost_update events. The session
  picker reads from the filesystem. These are our built-ins.

  The routing decision — which tier handles a given input — is the core dispatch logic. In a shell, it's: check built-ins first, then functions/aliases, then PATH lookup. In our
  surface, it could be:

  1. Does the input start with a surface command prefix (maybe : or a UI gesture)? → Surface built-in
  2. Does the input look like natural language or start with /? → Claude Code
  3. Otherwise → Shell

  Or, more interesting: the surface could be context-aware. If you're in a conversation with Claude Code and type text, it goes to Claude Code. If you click into the command prompt
  area, it goes to the shell. Or a single prompt that infers intent. This is a design question with big UX implications — worth exploring but not locking down yet.

  The key architectural point: the surface built-ins form a stable layer that exists regardless of whether Claude Code or the shell is connected. You can display cost, switch
  themes, manage sessions, and navigate history even if both backends are down. This is exactly how shell built-ins work — cd, echo, export work even if PATH is empty and no
  externals are available.

  2. Shell Man Pages: What We Should Extract

  You're right that this is essential homework. Let me outline what matters most.

  ⎿  Done (0 tool uses · 10.5k tokens · 37s)
  (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Good. Now, the shell research confirms several things that directly inform our design. Let me address all four of your points.

  2. Lessons From Decades of Shell Development

  The research highlights six "inviolable laws" of shell UX that we need to respect:

  1. Ctrl-C always interrupts. This maps directly — our surface needs an interrupt mechanism, and Claude Code already has one ({ type: "interrupt" }).
  2. The prompt means "ready for input." Our surface needs a clear readiness signal. Today that's the blinking cursor after $. We need our equivalent.
  3. Commands are text. Users paste commands from docs, Stack Overflow, READMEs. Our input must accept raw pasted command text and route it correctly. This is non-negotiable.
  4. The environment is sacred. direnv, nvm, conda, pyenv, homebrew — all work by mutating environment variables. Our shell session must faithfully maintain and pass the environment
   to child processes.
  5. Output is a stream. Even though we render richly, the underlying text must remain accessible for pipes, copy-paste, and grep.
  6. Failure is normal. Non-zero exit codes are information, not errors to hide.

  The startup file sequence matters too. Our shell bridge must launch the shell as login interactive (zsh -li or bash -li) to ensure the user's full environment is loaded — PATH,
  aliases, functions, conda activations, everything. If we skip .zprofile or .zshrc, the user's world is broken.

  The completion system is an unexpected treasure. Zsh's compsys and bash-completion contain machine-readable descriptions of command interfaces — argument types, subcommands,
  flags, file-type filters, dynamic completions (like git branch names). A graphical surface could use these specs to build contextual help, argument suggestions, or even structured
   input forms. This is richer than Fig's command specs and it's already installed on every developer's machine.

  3. The Environment Question

  This is the heart of "what makes it a real shell." The environment for our single surface needs:

  Working directory (cwd): Each shell session has a cwd. When the user types cd src, the cwd changes. Claude Code also has a cwd (it's in system_metadata). In the unified surface,
  these should be the same cwd — or at least visibly connected. If you cd in the shell and then ask Claude Code a question, Claude should know where you are. This might mean: the
  shell's cwd is the source of truth, and Claude Code's cwd follows it (or vice versa).

  Variables and export: Shell variables (FOO=bar) and exported environment variables (export FOO=bar). Our shell bridge must maintain the full environment faithfully. Tools like
  direnv automatically set/unset variables when you enter/leave directories — this must work.

  Aliases and functions: Users have hundreds of these in .zshrc. alias gst='git status', function mkcd() { mkdir -p $1 && cd $1 }. Our shell bridge runs a real shell, so these work
  automatically. The graphical surface might even display them in a discoverable way — which shells today don't do well.

  Startup files: As noted above, we need the full sequence: .zshenv → .zprofile → .zshrc (for zsh login interactive). Users spend years curating these files. Our surface must honor
  them completely.

  PATH: This is the most critical environment variable. Every external command lookup depends on it. Homebrew, nvm, pyenv, cargo, go — all add to PATH. Our shell bridge inherits
  PATH from the shell process, which inherits it from the startup files. This should just work if we launch the shell correctly.

  Integration with Claude Code's environment: Claude Code already receives cwd, tools, model, permission mode, and session state via system_metadata. The question is whether the
  shell's environment and Claude Code's environment should be unified or parallel. My instinct: parallel but synchronized. The shell has its own process with its own environment.
  Claude Code has its own process. But the surface keeps them in sync — cd in the shell updates the surface's notion of cwd, and the next Claude Code turn picks up the new cwd.
  Environment variables set in the shell (like export RUST_LOG=debug) should be visible to Claude Code's tool calls if they spawn subprocesses.

  4. The Name

  Let me think about this honestly. The candidates:

  - "tug-conversation" — too narrow now. This was right when the scope was just Claude Code chat.
  - "single surface" — describes the concept, not the thing. Good for internal discussion, not a name.
  - "graphical terminal" — contradictory. We're explicitly not a terminal. The whole point is shedding the terminal.
  - "tide" (Tug IDE) — has appeal. It evokes flow, a natural force, something that comes in and goes out. It's short and memorable. But "IDE" might be misleading — this isn't an
  editor-centric environment. It's a command surface that happens to include AI.

  Some other directions to consider:

  - "tugdeck" — you already have this name, and it's the actual rendering surface. The expanded vision could just be what tugdeck becomes. The deck is the surface where everything
  happens. Not a new name, but a deepened meaning.
  - "tugsurface" — literal, clear, forgettable.
  - "tugway" — a way of working. Short. Evokes a path or channel.
  - "helm" — where you steer the ship from. Short, evocative, nautical (tug-adjacent). But overloaded in tech (Kubernetes Helm).
  - "tug-bridge" — the bridge of a ship, where the captain commands from. Fits the "single surface where you command everything" concept. Also literally describes the architecture
  (bridges between shell, Claude Code, and the UI). Might confuse with the software "bridge" pattern though.

  My honest take: tugdeck is the strongest option you already have. The roadmap document could be titled something like "tugdeck: the unified command surface" or just update the
  tug-conversation.md vision statement. The name "deck" already implies a surface where work happens — the deck of a ship, a flight deck, a deck of cards spread out. It's where you
  command from. The fact that it started as "just the web frontend" and grows to encompass this larger vision is a strength, not a weakness — the name scales with the ambition.

  Tide is my second pick if you want a distinct name for the concept (as opposed to the implementation). "Tide is the vision; tugdeck is the implementation."

  What do you think? Once you settle on direction for naming, I'll draft the roadmap document that integrates everything — the existing Claude Code transport work, the shell bridge,
   the adapter architecture, the unified surface, and the phased plan to build it all.

❯ Great. Now...

- Let's just choose `tide` as the codename for this project now. `tugdeck` is a bigger concept. Let's keep these separate.

- I want this whole conversation saved as reference material exactly as it is. A wealth of interesting material here to contemplate and discuss. Save it into the @roadmap/
directory.

- "Or, more interesting: the surface could be context-aware. If you're in a conversation with Claude Code and type text, it goes to Claude Code. If you click into the command
prompt area, it goes to the shell. Or a single prompt that infers intent. This is a design question with big UX implications — worth exploring but not locking down yet."

🢁 My exact idea here. What is the "command entry" area accepted an initial character to "direct" or "hint" the following command. I'm thinking '>' for Claude and "$" for the shell.

For example, these seem very clear.

> which files need an update for the new "foo" feature
$ which git

- Finally, draft the roadmap document that integrates everything. Save it into the @roadmap/ directory.

Let's go!
