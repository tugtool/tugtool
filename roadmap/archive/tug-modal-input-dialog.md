## TugModalInputDialog: an app-modal input primitive, Open Quickly rebuilt on it, TugCompletionPopup retired {#phase-slug}

**Purpose:** Ship a new `TugModalInputDialog` primitive — TugAlert's app-modal machinery around a typing-first HUD input — move Open Quickly onto it with a `TugFileChooser` scope row replacing the embedded directory-switcher popup, adopt the KBF mode design (⌥⇥ engages the mode inside the dialog), and retire `TugCompletionPopup`.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

Open Quickly today is `TugCompletionPopup` (`tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-completion-popup.tsx`) mounted from `OpenQuicklyOverlay` (`tugdeck/src/components/chrome/open-quickly-overlay.tsx`, rendered once at deck level in `deck-canvas.tsx`). It is a popup pretending to be modal: dismissal is held together by an `onBlur` handler with three exemptions (in-panel focus, the engine key sink, a caller `dismissGuard`), a backdrop `onMouseDown`, and an app-resign observer. The `dismissGuard` exists solely because the directory-switcher accessory — a `TugPopupButton` whose Radix menu portals outside the panel — makes focus-in-the-menu look like focus-leaving-the-popup. That same portalled menu is the focus watchdog's known blind spot (`roadmap/kbf-mode-continued-brief.md#brief-open-quickly`), and the ⌥⇥ gesture inside the popup was mis-routed until commit `1e86cd245` routed `cycle-focus-mode` through the action registry and made the toggle act on the top trapped mode. The brief's verdict was to rework the surface rather than patch it further.

The rework: a new app-modal primitive, `TugModalInputDialog`, borrowing TugAlert's modality wholesale (Radix Dialog, blocking overlay, engine focus trap, in-jail key sink). Open Quickly keeps its large HUD input, its file-match mechanism, and its result dropdown, but the embedded directory-switcher popup is retired in full and replaced by the same three-part `TugFileChooser` (path field with `/api/fs/complete` completion + recents seed + native Browse… button) the session picker's *Project path* uses — placed as a bare row **above** the HUD input. Real modality deletes the entire blur-dismiss apparatus. The dialog adopts the KBF mode design: typing-first at open, ⌥⇥ engages the mode over the dialog's own stops.

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- Build the primitive first, with a gallery card, before touching Open Quickly — the component is proven standalone, then adopted.
- Borrow TugAlert's modality machinery (`tug-alert.tsx`) rather than inventing: Radix `Dialog` (imported as `AlertDialog` from `@radix-ui/react-dialog` there), `useFocusTrap` with `deferDomFocusToTeardown`, prevented Radix auto-focus/Escape, an in-jail `[data-tug-key-sink]`, `isCancelChordEvent` for ⌘.
- Migrate the field/list/provider internals of `TugCompletionPopup` into the primitive largely intact — that part was never the problem.
- Move Open Quickly onto the primitive in one step: chooser row in, switcher out, blur-dismiss apparatus deleted.
- KBF adoption is a verification-plus-hygiene step, not a mechanism build: the `1e86cd245` gate already makes ⌥⇥ act on the top trapped mode; what the dialog owes is stops worth ringing and manual-bit hygiene at close. It carries its own test (at0396 test 3, the parked `c6ef67aba` todo) rather than deferring its proof to the test step — a step whose only checkpoint is a live walk cannot be closed by anything but a person's memory of it.
- Tests are rewritten against the new surface (at0213, at0306, at0396), then the old component and its `@covers` references are retired.
- Proof discipline from `roadmap/kbf-mode-continued-brief.md#brief-proof` applies: a suite counts as cover only after it has been made to fail (`tugutil file probe` with a reverse patch).

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- ⇧⌘O opens an app-modal Open Quickly: a click on any surface beneath the overlay activates nothing beneath it (at0213 asserts the deck state is unchanged after an outside click, and that the click dismissed the dialog).
- Typing works from the first keystroke; ↓ on an **empty** query selects the first result (at0396 test 1, unchanged in spirit).
- The directory-switcher popup (`data-testid="open-quickly-switcher-menu"`) no longer exists anywhere in the tree; a `TugFileChooser` row sits above the input (at0306 rewritten).
- Settling a directory in the chooser re-scopes the search: results come from the new root (at0306 asserts a file unique to the second directory appears after the switch). A **mouse** pick in the chooser's dropdown is one of the covered paths — it is the interaction Radix's modal treatment most nearly breaks ([Q01]).
- A Tab off the chooser that changes nothing changes nothing: the scope stands, no `probeDirs` round trip fires, and the walk lands on the next stop rather than bouncing back to the HUD input ([P09], at0396 test 2).
- ⌥⇥ inside the dialog engages KBF mode and rings a stop **inside the dialog**, never the card behind it; ⌥⇥ again from a parked stop disengages; dismissing the dialog after a ⌥⇥ pressed inside it leaves no ring on the deck (at0396 test 3, resurrected and made to fail first).
- `tug-completion-popup.tsx` / `.css` are deleted; `bunx vite build` and `just app-test-covers-check` pass afterward.
- The onBlur/dismissGuard/backdrop-mousedown dismissal code has no successor in the new component — dismissal is exactly: Escape ladder, ⌘., outside interaction (when opted in), app resign, commit.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. New `TugModalInputDialog` component + CSS + gallery card + registration.
2. Rewrite of `OpenQuicklyBody` in `open-quickly-overlay.tsx` onto the primitive, with the `TugFileChooser` scope row.
3. Retirement of the directory-switcher accessory and all its plumbing (`switcherLabels`, `rootCandidates` menu shaping, `dismissGuard`, `SWITCHER_MENU`).
4. KBF adoption: ⌥⇥ engages over the dialog's stops; manual-bit hygiene at close.
5. App-test rewrites (at0213, at0306, at0396) and `@covers` sweep; deletion of `tug-completion-popup.tsx`/`.css` and the `switcher-labels` unit test.
6. Doctrine updates: `tuglaws/focus-language.md` references to `TugCompletionPopup` as the typing-first carve-out.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- No change to the file-match mechanism: `FeedStore(FILETREE)` + `FileTreeStore` + `getFileCompletionProvider` + `parseFileLocationQuery` + `openFileInCard` are carried over as-is.
- No change to `open-quickly-store.ts` or the `open-quickly` action dispatch in `deck-canvas.tsx`.
- No arrow-key spatial order inside the dialog (TugAlert's `AlertSpatialOrder` pattern): the Tab walk plus the attached-list arrows are the whole keyboard story; a spatial ring over three stops adds nothing.
- No promise-returning imperative handle (TugAlert's `alert()`/`choose()`): Open Quickly's open state lives in its store; the primitive is declarative (`open` prop / mount-while-open).
- No general watchdog portal exemption (`roadmap/kbf-mode-continued-brief.md#brief-open-quickly` names it): retiring the portalled switcher removes the bleeding case from this surface; the general fix is separate work.
- No changes to the composer's `@`-completion menu (`TugComboBox` / completion-menu machinery) beyond `@covers` corrections.

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- Commit `1e86cd245` (⌥⇥ acts on the focus mode that owns the keyboard) — landed; the registry-routed `cycle-focus-mode` behavior is what [P03] builds on.
- Commit `2d8117575` (paint stands down while a caret is granted) and `fd7e49145` (chord-ring resolution) — the route-keyed paint the seeded field relies on.
- Commit `b31e33dd7` (trap-exit clears manual bit for engaging traps) — the rule [P04] extends to this typing-first trap at the component level.
- `TugFileChooser` / `TugComboBox` with the attached-list declaration from `c6ef67aba` (combo-box arrows fixed) — landed.

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- Tuglaws: [L01] one render root, [L02] external state via `useSyncExternalStore`, [L03] `useLayoutEffect` for registrations, [L06] appearance via CSS+DOM, [L19] component authoring (`data-slot`, tokens), [L25] canvas-overlay portal, [L29] path canonicalization is the server's answer. Cross-check `tuglaws/tuglaws.md`, `tuglaws/focus-language.md`, `tuglaws/component-authoring.md` before coding; name the laws in commit messages.
- `-D warnings` across the Rust workspace is irrelevant here, but `bunx vite build` must pass before any tugdeck step is declared done (debug app loads the prod rollup bundle).
- App-tests run via `just app-test <files…>` / `just app-test-changed`, output never piped.
- Persistent state (none new here) would go through tugbank, never Web storage.
- No `Task` sub-agents were used to author this plan; implementation follows the tugplug `implement` flow.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- `TugComboBox` portals its dropdown into the canvas overlay root unconditionally (`createPortal` + `useCanvasOverlay`, `tug-combo-box.tsx:224`, `:620-670`) — verified by inspection. That dropdown is a sibling of the Radix `Dialog.Content` in the overlay root, not a descendant, which is what [Q01] is about. Not an assumption any more: the Radix source says a modal `Content` makes every non-layer node pointer-dead, so [Q01] resolves toward moving the dropdown inside rather than negotiating with the outside.
- The engine's manual-bit API on `FocusManager` — `kbfManual(): boolean`, `setKbfManual(value: boolean)`, `toggleKbfManual()` — is sufficient for [P04]; no engine change is needed.
- at0051/at0103/at0176 carry `@covers tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-completion-popup.tsx` lines that are stale (those tests drive the composer's completion menu, not this component); they will be removed, not repointed, after verifying each test never mounts Open Quickly.

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] Radix modal semantics vs. the chooser's portalled dropdown (OPEN → resolve in step 1) {#q01-radix-portal-dropdown}

**Question:** With `Dialog.Root` modal (TugAlert's configuration), the `TugFileChooser`'s completion dropdown portals into the canvas overlay root **outside** `Dialog.Content`. What makes that dropdown clickable, and what keeps a click in it from dismissing the dialog?

**Why it matters:** If unhandled, picking a completion row in the chooser would either be dead or dismiss the whole dialog, i.e. the marquee new UI element would not work with the mouse.

**What the Radix source says (read, not guessed):** modal `Dialog.Content` carries `disableOutsidePointerEvents`, and `DismissableLayer` implements that by setting `document.body.style.pointerEvents = "none"` and re-enabling `pointer-events: auto` only on **registered layers** (`node_modules/@radix-ui/react-dismissable-layer/dist/index.mjs:72-104`). The chooser's dropdown is a plain `<ul>` portalled into the canvas overlay root by `TugComboBox` (`tug-combo-box.tsx:620-670`) — not a layer, so it is pointer-dead. Because it cannot receive the pointerdown at all, a target-inspecting `onInteractOutside` guard has nothing to inspect: the failure mode is `pointer-events`, not dismissal routing. `hideOthers`/`aria-hidden` compounds it on the a11y side.

**Options, in the order to try them:**
1. **Render the dropdown inside `Dialog.Content`.** Add a `portalContainer` pass-through to `TugComboBox` (which today always portals to `useCanvasOverlay()`) and to `TugFileChooser`; the dialog passes its own panel element. Inside the jail the dropdown is not outside anything: pointer-events, inert, and outside-interaction all dissolve at once, and no guard is needed. **Verify the panel's list `overflow` does not clip it** — the panel is the one thing that could.
2. `modal={false}` on `Dialog.Root` plus our own full-block overlay div (the primitive already renders `.tug-modal-input-dialog-overlay`); outside dismissal then rides the overlay's own `onMouseDown`, which never fires for the portalled dropdown because the dropdown stacks above it.
3. Keep Radix modal, force `pointer-events: auto` on the dropdown slot, and guard `onInteractOutside` by target (`[data-slot="tug-modal-input-dialog-chooser-overlay"]`, [P10]). Last resort: it fights the layer model rather than living in it, and leaves the `aria-hidden` half unaddressed.

**Plan to resolve:** Step 1 builds the gallery card with a `TugFileChooser` in the header slot; probe both interactions (dropdown row click; outside click) in the real app via the gallery before step 2 builds on it.

**Resolution:** RESOLVED via **option 1** (commit `b58a0d479`). `portalContainer` was added to `TugComboBox` and `TugFileChooser` and the dialog passes its own panel element (published through `useModalInputDialogPanel`), so the chooser's dropdown renders inside `Dialog.Content`. Probed in the running app over the gallery card: the dropdown is a descendant of the panel, its rows compute `pointer-events: auto`, a mouse pick lands and the dialog stays up, and a click outside dismisses without pressing the button beneath it. The panel is centered with `margin-inline: auto` rather than a transform precisely so it does not become a containing block for the `position: fixed` dropdown, which would both mis-position it and expose it to the panel's `overflow: hidden`. Reverse-patching `portalContainer` to `null` sent the containment assertion red, so the probe discriminates.

#### [Q02] Seed items for the chooser: candidate shaping (DECIDED — see [P07]) {#q02-seed-shaping}

**Question:** Whether the switcher's candidate machinery (`rootCandidates`, `probeDirs` existence/canonicality filtering, `switcherLabels` disambiguation) survives into the chooser's seed.

**Resolution:** DECIDED (see [P07]): the candidate *list* survives (binding → default → recents, deduped, capped at 7, probe-filtered per [L29]); the *label* machinery (`switcherLabels`) dies — the chooser shows full paths like the session picker's recents, so leaf-name disambiguation is moot.

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Radix modal blocks the portalled chooser dropdown ([Q01]) | high | high (confirmed in the Radix source) | Step 1 gallery probe before Open Quickly builds on it; three ranked mechanisms specified, the first of which removes the seam rather than guarding it | Dropdown rows unclickable or dialog dismisses on row click |
| Rewritten at0396 passes without discriminating (the standing `1e86cd245` lesson) | high | med | Every new assertion is probe-verified red first (`tugutil file probe` with a reverse patch); fixture binds a session card so the behind-the-dialog tier exists | A green run on a patched-out gate |
| Manual bit stranded after ⌥⇥ inside the dialog | med | high without [P04] | [P04] component-level restore at close; asserted in at0396 test 3 | Ring visible on deck after dismissing the dialog |
| A typed scope path that does not exist | low | med | [P07]: re-scope only on settle, after `probeDirs` confirms existence and canonicalizes; a failed probe leaves the scope unchanged | Empty results after typing a bogus path |

**Risk R01: Radix inert/outside-interaction vs. portalled dropdown** {#r01-radix-inert}

- **Risk:** The chooser's dropdown, portalled outside `Dialog.Content`, is pointer-dead under Radix's `disableOutsidePointerEvents` (body `pointer-events: none`, restored only on registered layers) and `aria-hidden` under `hideOthers`.
- **Mitigation:** [Q01]'s three ranked mechanisms, probed in the gallery in step 1 before adoption; option 1 (portal the dropdown into the panel) removes the outside-ness the risk is made of.
- **Residual risk:** Future Radix upgrades change inert handling; the gallery card keeps the probe surface alive.

**Risk R02: coverage that does not discriminate** {#r02-nondiscriminating-tests}

- **Risk:** at0396's third test was committed green while proving nothing (unbound fixture card). A rewrite can repeat this.
- **Mitigation:** The fixture binds a session card (`bindSession` + `awaitEngineReady`, already written in at0396); each behavioral assertion is shown red under a reverse patch before the step closes.
- **Residual risk:** Probe discipline is manual; the checkpoint lists the probes explicitly so `implement` runs them.

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] TugModalInputDialog borrows TugAlert's modality machinery (DECIDED) {#p01-borrow-alert-modality}

**Decision:** The primitive composes Radix `Dialog` from `@radix-ui/react-dialog` (not `AlertDialog` — same force-focus reasoning documented at the top of `tug-alert.tsx`), portalled into the canvas overlay root via `useCanvasOverlay()` [L25], with a blocking overlay element, `useFocusTrap({ active, deferDomFocusToTeardown: true, onEscapeDismiss, kbf: false })`, Radix `onOpenAutoFocus`/`onEscapeKeyDown` both prevented, `onCloseAutoFocus` wired to the trap's writer, an in-jail `<div data-tug-key-sink tabIndex={-1} className="tug-key-sink" />` rendered first inside `FocusModeScope`, and ⌘. handled via `isCancelChordEvent` from `keymap-registry.ts`. The panel carries a **visually-hidden `Dialog.Title`** (the placeholder text is its name) and `aria-describedby={undefined}` on `Content`: `@radix-ui/react-dialog@1.1.15` fires a `DialogTitleWarning` `console.error` for any `Content` without a `Title` (`dist/index.mjs:280-288`), and an `aria-label` on the panel does not silence it.

**Rationale:**
- TugAlert is the proven app-modal exemplar; every one of those pieces exists because a failure taught it (the key-sink-inside-the-jail comment in `tug-alert.tsx` is the canonical example).
- The engine's Escape ladder must own Escape ([P01]/[P02] of focus-language) — the completion popup already worked this way; only the modality shell changes.

**Implications:**
- Tokens are the component's own family, `--tugx-modal-input-*`, declared in `tug-modal-input-dialog.css` under the seven-slot header block [L19] — the house pattern every sibling follows (`tug-completion-popup.css:26-35`, `tug-alert.css`), not a shared declaration in `tug-dialog.css`; the component ships `tug-modal-input-dialog.tsx` + `tug-modal-input-dialog.css` in `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/`, exporting `TugModalInputDialog`.
- No Radix `AlertDialog.Action`/`Cancel` — the dialog has no button row; commit is Enter, dismiss is Escape/⌘./outside.

#### [P02] Typing-first at open (DECIDED) {#p02-typing-first}

**Decision:** The trap passes `kbf: false` and the primitive seeds the key view onto the input via `useSeedKeyView` — exactly the completion popup's configuration and the doctrine's typing-first carve-out (`tuglaws/focus-language.md`, "A typing-first trap passes `kbf: false`").

**Rationale:**
- Auto-engaging would hand ↑/↓ to the engine's ring and the field's own key handling would never run — the regression KBF mode was written for (at0396's module doc).

**Implications:**
- The dialog opens with a caret, no rings (the route-keyed paint from `2d8117575` guarantees the pair never coexists).
- The input wrapper carries `ATTACHED_LIST_ATTRIBUTE` from `focus-manager.ts` so ↑/↓ drive the result list from the field, empty query or not.

#### [P03] The dialog adopts the KBF mode design: ⌥⇥ engages over its own stops (DECIDED) {#p03-kbf-adoption}

**Decision:** ⌥⇥ inside the dialog engages KBF mode via the manual bit, acting on the dialog's trapped mode per the `1e86cd245` gate ("while a floating surface holds a trapped mode, the toggle applies to that mode and the ring seeds among its own stops"). The dialog's engine stops are: the HUD input (order 0), the chooser's path field, and the Browse… button — all authored into one focus group ([P10]). Engaged, the ring walks those stops (Tab/⇧Tab), the field parks when walked away from, ↑/↓ on the input still drive the attached result list, and Enter on the parked field claims the caret first (the at0141 semantics from `c6ef67aba`). ⌥⇥ again from a parked stop disengages; from a granted caret it re-engages (parks) per focus-language [P09].

**Rationale:**
- The user's direction: the component adopts the KBF mode design; ⌥⇥ enters the mode.
- No new mechanism is required — `toggleKbfManual` + the gate + the stops are all landed; the dialog's job is to *be* a well-formed trapped mode with stops worth ringing (an empty group never holds the keyboard).
- The parked ⌥⇥ test from `c6ef67aba` (test.todo in at0396) becomes provable on this surface: the old defect was the ring landing on the card behind the popup; the modal overlay plus the gate make "inside the dialog" assertable.

**Implications:**
- ⇧Tab from the HUD field no longer dead-ends in a park with nowhere useful to go — the walk lands on the chooser's path field, another typing surface.
- at0396 test 3 is resurrected against this surface and probe-verified (Risk R02).

#### [P04] Manual-bit hygiene at close (DECIDED) {#p04-manual-bit-hygiene}

**Decision:** The primitive captures `focusManager.kbfManual()` when its trap goes active; at deactivate/unmount it **restores the captured bit** — `setKbfManual(captured)` — unless the pointer cleared it in the meantime (`kbfManualClearedByPointer()`), in which case it stands down and leaves the pointer's answer alone.

**Rationale:**
- `popFocusMode` clears the manual bit only for engaging traps (`trapped && kbf !== false && modeStack.length === 0` — the guard at `focus-manager.ts:1712`, doctrine row "An engaging trap is left" in `tuglaws/focus-language.md#kbf-disengages`); a `kbf: false` trap "manages its own bit". Without this, ⌥⇥ pressed inside the dialog strands a ring on the deck the user returns to.
- A bit that was already on before open belongs to the user's deck-level mode and must survive the dialog.
- Restore, not clear-if-newly-set: the opposite direction is just as real. A user inside a session card's focus cycle — which *is* the manual bit (`use-cycle-mode.tsx:229`) — who presses ⌥⇥ **off** inside the dialog would otherwise leave that cycle silently disengaged after close. Restoring covers both directions for the same amount of code.
- The pointer exemption is not optional: `clearKbfManualForPointer` (`focus-manager.ts:4064`) is the user reaching for the mouse, and re-asserting a captured `true` over it would repaint a ring they just dismissed.

**Implications:**
- Implemented inside `TugModalInputDialog` (a `useLayoutEffect` paired with the trap's `active`), so every future consumer inherits the hygiene.
- Asserted by at0396 test 3's final clause (no ring after dismiss).

#### [P05] Outside interaction dismisses, opt-in; the overlay always blocks (DECIDED) {#p05-outside-click}

**Decision:** The primitive takes `dismissOnOutsideClick?: boolean` (default `false`, the alert-like strict posture). When `true`, an outside interaction dismisses (`onInteractOutside` → call `onDismiss`) — but the overlay still swallows the event, so nothing beneath activates. Whether the chooser's dropdown counts as "outside" is settled by the [Q01] mechanism, not by this prop: under option 1 the dropdown lives inside `Content` and the question never arises. Open Quickly passes `true`.

**Rationale:**
- User decision: yes to outside-click dismiss for Open Quickly — it is a launcher, not an alert.
- A future strict consumer (a required input) gets TugAlert semantics by default.

**Implications:**
- at0213's outside-click test changes meaning: it must now also assert the click did **not** activate what it landed on (the old popup's backdrop click was already non-activating; the assertion becomes explicit).

#### [P06] The blur-dismiss apparatus is deleted; app-resign dismissal stays, consumer-level (DECIDED) {#p06-no-blur-dismiss}

**Decision:** The primitive has no `onBlur` dismissal, no `dismissGuard`, no backdrop `onMouseDown` handler. The app-going-inactive dismissal (via `getAppLifecycle().observeApplicationWillResignActive`) moves to `OpenQuicklyBody` — it is launcher semantics ("a transient act on the frontmost window"), not modal semantics.

**Rationale:**
- Real modality means focus cannot wander; the exemption list existed to approximate that and is obsolete with a blocking overlay + Radix focus jail + in-jail key sink.
- An alert must survive an app switch; a launcher should not. The split belongs at the consumer.

**Implications:**
- The three-exemption `onBlur`, the `dismissGuard` prop and its `SWITCHER_MENU` querySelector predicate are deleted with no successor.

#### [P07] A bare TugFileChooser above the input replaces the directory switcher (DECIDED) {#p07-chooser-replaces-switcher}

**Decision:** The dialog's header slot holds a bare `TugFileChooser` (no label row — user decision), `kind="directory"`, `menuMode`, Browse… kept (`showBrowse` default, `browseFocusOrder` authored), full-width above the HUD input. Its controlled `value` is the active scope path; its `seed` is built from the switcher's candidate list (frontmost binding → default project path → `readSessionRecentProjects`, deduped, capped at `MAX_ROOT_CANDIDATES = 7`, probe-filtered by `probeDirs` for existence + canonical dedup per [L29]) rendered as full paths with match highlighting, in the shape of the session picker's `buildRecentsSeed` (`session-card.tsx`) minus the trash affordance. Re-scoping happens **only on settle** (`onSettle`, per the `TugComboBox` settle contract, honoring the no-resting-lies rule): the settled path is probed via `probeDirs`; if it exists, its canonical form becomes `pickedPath` and the workspace re-acquires exactly as today (`acquireDefaultWorkspace` / `acquireWorkspace` effect in `open-quickly-overlay.tsx`); if not, the scope is unchanged and the field text stands as typed.

**Rationale:**
- User decisions: retire the switcher in full; bring in the three-part chooser; place it above; bare, keep Browse.
- Settle-only re-scoping keeps keystrokes from thrashing the FILETREE feed and keeps a half-typed path from becoming a scope.
- `switcherLabels` disambiguation is moot on full paths; the function and its unit test (`src/__tests__/switcher-labels.test.ts`) retire with the switcher.

**Implications:**
- `leafName` survives (the placeholder still reads "Open Quickly in <leaf>"); `switcherLabels`, the `TugPopupButton` accessory, `useResponderForm`'s `SELECT_VALUE` wiring, and `SWITCHER_MENU` are deleted.
- The `probeDirs` candidate-filter effect keyed on `defaultPath` survives, now feeding the seed instead of the menu.

#### [P08] The completion internals fold into the primitive; TugCompletionPopup retires (DECIDED) {#p08-fold-and-retire}

**Decision:** `TugModalInputDialog` owns the completion field + result list directly: props `provider: CompletionProvider`, `onCommit(item)`, `onDismiss()`, `placeholder`, `emptyLabel?: () => string | null`, plus `header?: ReactNode` and `dismissOnOutsideClick`. The `renderLabel` match-run renderer, the pull/subscribe provider loop, the selected-row state and scroll-into-view, and the row mouse handling migrate from `tug-completion-popup.tsx` with new class/slot names. `TugCompletionPopup` and its CSS are deleted once Open Quickly is moved; no shared `TugCompletionField` extraction until a second consumer exists.

**Rationale:**
- Open Quickly is the sole consumer (verified: the only other `TugCompletionPopup` reference is a doc comment in `use-focus-trap.tsx`).
- A generic-slots primitive with a separate field component is speculative structure; fold-in is reversible when a second consumer motivates the split.

**Implications:**
- Exported constants become `MODAL_INPUT_DIALOG_FOCUS_GROUP` / field order 0; the `accessory` prop does **not** carry over (the header slot replaces its one use).
- The `use-focus-trap.tsx` doc comment naming `TugCompletionPopup` updates to name `TugModalInputDialog`.

#### [P09] Settling the chooser returns the key view to the HUD input (DECIDED) {#p09-settle-returns-focus}

**Decision:** After a re-scope that actually **changed the scope** (settle → probe ok → the canonical path differs from the current `activePath` → workspace swap), `OpenQuicklyBody` re-seeds the key view onto the HUD input (engine placement via the focus-key, the `useSeedKeyView`/`place` vocabulary — never a raw `.focus()`). A settle whose canonical path equals the live scope re-seeds nothing and probes nothing.

**Rationale:**
- The user's next act after choosing a scope is typing a filename; leaving the keyboard in the chooser makes every scope change cost a Tab walk back.
- The Browse… path settles the same way (`TugFileChooser`'s `browse` calls `onSettle` directly), so the native panel round-trip also lands back in the input.
- **The changed-only guard is load-bearing, not tidiness.** `TugComboBox` settles on **blur**, not only on accept/Enter/browse (`tug-combo-box.tsx:529-538`: `onBlur` closes the list and calls `settle(value)`). An unconditional re-seed therefore fires when the keyboard merely *leaves* the chooser: the Tab walk from the chooser field to Browse… (T01 stop 1 → stop 2) would settle the unchanged path, probe ok, and bounce the key view back to stop 0. The walk would appear to skip Browse entirely. The same guard also stops a `probeDirs` round trip on every focus change.

**Implications:**
- The seed is a placement, so it grants the caret (focus-language [P12]); if KBF was manually engaged, the paint stands down while the caret is live — correct and already doctrine.
- at0396 test 2 (the Tab walk) is the assertion that pins the guard: patching the guard out must make it fail (a step-4 probe).

#### [P10] Naming, slots, and focus orders (DECIDED) {#p10-naming-orders}

**Decision:** Component `TugModalInputDialog` in `tug-modal-input-dialog.tsx`/`.css` [L19]. Slots: `tug-modal-input-dialog-overlay`, `tug-modal-input-dialog` (panel, `role="dialog"`), `-header`, `-field`, `-input`, `-list`, `-row`, `-empty`, `-match`. Focus group `MODAL_INPUT_DIALOG_FOCUS_GROUP = "tug-modal-input-dialog"`; orders: HUD input `0`, chooser path field `1`, Browse `2` (Open Quickly passes `focusGroup`/`focusOrder`/`browseFocusOrder` into `TugFileChooser`, which already supports all three).

The chooser's dropdown needs two things `TugFileChooser` does not currently expose, both plain pass-throughs to the `TugComboBox` it composes, and both added in step 1 because [Q01] is answered with them:

- `portalContainer?: HTMLElement | null` — new on **both** components. `TugComboBox` today portals unconditionally to `useCanvasOverlay()` (`tug-combo-box.tsx:224`, `:620-670`); the prop lets a host name the container instead, which is [Q01] option 1. Absent ⇒ today's behavior, so every existing caller is untouched.
- `overlaySlot?: string` — `TugComboBox` already takes it; `TugFileChooser` **hardcodes** `overlaySlot="tug-file-chooser-overlay"` (`tug-file-chooser.tsx:233`) and must forward the caller's value instead, defaulting to the current string. The dialog passes `tug-modal-input-dialog-chooser-overlay`, which is also the [Q01] option-3 guard selector.

CSS carries the HUD look over from `tug-completion-popup.css` (175 lines) with renamed selectors; the `--tugx-modal-input-*` family is declared in `tug-modal-input-dialog.css` itself ([P01]); overlay/backdrop styling aligns with `tug-alert.css`'s overlay treatment.

**Rationale:**
- Tab from the seeded input goes visually "up" to the chooser and wraps — the walk order matches the read order with the input first because the input is the surface's home.

**Implications:**
- All app-test selectors change; the test steps enumerate the new ones.

### Deep Dives {#deep-dives}

#### What the current code does, for the cold reader {#current-code-map}

- **Store/mount:** `tugdeck/src/lib/open-quickly-store.ts` (module singleton, `openOpenQuickly`/`closeOpenQuickly`/`subscribeOpenQuickly`/`getOpenQuicklyOpen`); `OpenQuicklyOverlay` rendered in `deck-canvas.tsx`, which reads the store via `useSyncExternalStore` and mounts `OpenQuicklyBody` only while open (the search stack's lifetime is the popup's). None of this changes.
- **Search stack (carried over verbatim):** `OpenQuicklyBody` captures the frontmost binding once (`frontmostProjectRoot` → `bindingRef`), resolves the default project path (`useTugbankValue` of `DEFAULT_PROJECT_PATH_DOMAIN`/`KEY` + `resolveProjectPathFrom` + `useHostFacts`), computes `activePath = pickedPath ?? binding ?? default`, acquires non-binding workspaces (`acquireDefaultWorkspace`/`acquireWorkspace` + `subscribeWorkspaces`/`getWorkspace`), rebuilds a `FeedStore(FeedId.FILETREE)` + `FileTreeStore` keyed on `workspaceKey` (disposing the previous), wraps the provider with `parseFileLocationQuery` (splitting `:line`, relativizing absolute paths, stashing `lineRef`), and commits through `openFileInCard(store, resolveAgainstRoot(projectDir, relative), lineRef.current)` then `closeOpenQuickly()`. The `emptyLabel` callback reads `fileTreeStore.hasResponded()` to distinguish "still thinking" from "no files".
- **What retires:** the switcher accessory (a `TugPopupButton` in a `ResponderScope` from `useResponderForm` with a `SELECT_VALUE` handler setting `pickedPath`; menu items from `rootCandidates` + `switcherLabels`; rendered only when `candidates.length > 1`), the `dismissGuard` querySelector on `SWITCHER_MENU`, and in the popup component: the three-exemption `onBlur`, the backdrop `onMouseDown`, the `accessory`/`dismissGuard` props.
- **TugAlert modality parts to copy (all in `tug-alert.tsx`):** the `import * as AlertDialog from "@radix-ui/react-dialog"` alias trick with the explanatory comment; `useFocusTrap({ active: open, deferDomFocusToTeardown: true, onEscapeDismiss })`; `Dialog.Portal container={overlayRoot}`; `Overlay` + `Content` with `onInteractOutside`, `onOpenAutoFocus={e => e.preventDefault()}` (the engine seeds instead), `onEscapeKeyDown={e => e.preventDefault()}`, `onCloseAutoFocus={onCloseAutoFocus}`, `onKeyDown` with `isCancelChordEvent`; the in-jail key-sink div with its ([P13]) comment rationale. The dialog seeds via `useSeedKeyView(`${MODAL_INPUT_DIALOG_FOCUS_GROUP}:0`)` (the completion popup's mechanism), not TugAlert's `place()`-on-open — the input is a text stop, so the seed grants a caret.
- **KBF plumbing the dialog leans on (no changes):** `FocusManager.kbfEngaged()` derives from four inputs; the manual bit API is `kbfManual()`/`setKbfManual()`/`toggleKbfManual()`; the `cycle-focus-mode` command is registry-routed and applies to the top trapped mode; `popFocusMode` clears the manual bit only for `trapped && kbf !== false` entries; paint is route-keyed (`kbfPainting()`), so caret and rings never coexist.

#### Dismissal inventory, before and after {#dismissal-inventory}

| Path | Old popup | New dialog |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Escape | engine ladder via trap `onEscapeDismiss` | unchanged |
| ⌘. | none | `isCancelChordEvent` → dismiss (new, from TugAlert) |
| Outside click | backdrop `onMouseDown`, guarded by `dismissGuard` | `onInteractOutside` → dismiss when `dismissOnOutsideClick` ([P05]); the chooser dropdown is inside, not guarded-outside, per the [Q01] mechanism; overlay always blocks |
| Focus leaves | field `onBlur` with three exemptions | **deleted** ([P06]) |
| App resigns active | popup-level lifecycle observer | consumer-level in `OpenQuicklyBody` ([P06]) |
| Commit | `onCommit` → caller closes | unchanged |

---

### Specification {#specification}

**Spec S01: TugModalInputDialog public API** {#s01-component-api}

```tsx
export const MODAL_INPUT_DIALOG_FOCUS_GROUP = "tug-modal-input-dialog";
export const MODAL_INPUT_DIALOG_FIELD_ORDER = 0;

export interface TugModalInputDialogProps {
  /** Accessible name (the visually-hidden Dialog.Title) + empty-field placeholder. */
  placeholder?: string;
  /** Completion source: (query) => items, optional subscribe. */
  provider: CompletionProvider;
  /** Return on the highlight / row click. */
  onCommit: (item: CompletionItem) => void;
  /** Escape ladder, ⌘., outside interaction (when enabled). */
  onDismiss: () => void;
  /** Rendered above the HUD input, inside the trap/jail — Open Quickly's chooser row. */
  header?: React.ReactNode;
  /** Empty-list message; null = still thinking, render nothing. */
  emptyLabel?: () => string | null;
  /** Launcher posture: outside interaction dismisses. Default false (alert posture). */
  dismissOnOutsideClick?: boolean;
}
```

Mount-while-open like the popup (the component renders `active: true` traps unconditionally; the consumer mounts it only while open). Header-slot controls join the dialog's Tab walk by authoring into `MODAL_INPUT_DIALOG_FOCUS_GROUP` at orders > 0 — the same contract the old `accessory` documented.

**Table T01: engine stops in the Open Quickly dialog** {#t01-focus-orders}

| Stop | Order | Kind | On arrival (KBF engaged) |
|------|-------|------|--------------------------|
| HUD input | 0 | text (attached list) | parks (ring, no caret); Enter claims caret; ↑/↓ drive result list |
| Chooser path field | 1 | text (combo, attached list) | parks; typing after Enter-claim; ↓ opens the seed menu |
| Browse… button | 2 | engine-routed leaf | ring; Return/Space opens `NSOpenPanel` |

#### State Zone Mapping (tugdeck/tugways plans) {#state-zone-mapping}

| State | Zone (appearance / local-data / structure) | Mechanism | Law |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|
| open/closed | structure | existing `open-quickly-store` + `useSyncExternalStore` (unchanged) | [L02] |
| query, items, selected row | local-data | `useState` inside the dialog (migrated as-is) | — |
| scope path (`pickedPath`), chooser text | local-data | `useState` in `OpenQuicklyBody` | — |
| FeedStore/FileTreeStore stack | local-data (imperative) | `useRef` + dispose-on-swap (migrated as-is) | [L22]-style observation |
| KBF engagement, manual bit, key view, route | structure (engine) | `FocusManager` only — never mirrored in React state | [L22], focus-language |
| ring/caret paint | appearance | engine projection → `data-kbf`/`data-key-view-kbd` + CSS | [L06] |
| selected-row highlight | appearance | `data-selected` attribute + CSS (migrated as-is) | [L06] |

### Definitive Symbol Inventory {#symbol-inventory}

#### New files {#new-files}

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-modal-input-dialog.tsx` | The primitive |
| `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/tug-modal-input-dialog.css` | Its styles (HUD look from `tug-completion-popup.css`, overlay from `tug-alert.css` patterns) |
| `tugdeck/src/components/tugways/cards/gallery-modal-input-dialog.tsx` | Gallery card (static provider; a `TugFileChooser` in the header to keep the [Q01] probe surface alive) |

#### Symbols to add / modify {#symbols}

| Symbol | Kind | Location | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

#### Test Categories {#test-categories}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **App-test (real app)** | Drive Tug.app through the real dispatch/focus/render paths | All behavior here: modality, dismissal, KBF, re-scoping |
| **Probe (reverse patch)** | Prove an assertion discriminates | Every new at0396 assertion; the [P04] bit-clear |
| **Unit** | Pure functions | None new; `switcher-labels.test.ts` is deleted, not replaced |

#### What stays out of tests {#test-non-goals}

- jsdom/mock render tests of the dialog — banned pattern; the real app is cheap to drive.
- The native `NSOpenPanel` round-trip — not automatable headlessly; Browse's focus-stop behavior (ring, Return fires) is covered, the panel itself is not.
- FILETREE backend behavior — covered by existing at0306 plumbing and Rust-layer tests.

### Execution Steps {#execution-steps}

#### Step Status Ledger {#step-status-ledger}

| Step | Title | Status | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|
| #step-1 | Build TugModalInputDialog + gallery card; resolve [Q01] | done | `b58a0d479` |
| #step-2 | Move Open Quickly onto the primitive; chooser in, switcher out | done (live walk pending) | `b74f5989e` |
| #step-3 | KBF adoption: ⌥⇥ over the dialog's stops; manual-bit hygiene; at0396 test 3 | done (live walk pending) | `e1f0654c5` |
| #step-4 | Rewrite at0213 / at0306 / at0396 tests 1–2 against the new surface | done | `964b7f8f6` (at0396 landed with #step-3) |
| #step-5 | Retire TugCompletionPopup; sweep `@covers`; update doctrine | done | `d75e12411` |
| #step-6 | Integration checkpoint | done (machine gates); live walk pending | N/A |

**#step-6 notes.** The derived selection over the branch diff is 74 files — `focus-manager.ts` alone fans out to 68 — so it was refused as a sweep and the scope was named instead: the ~20-file core tier (19/20 green; `at0201`'s activation-click test failed in the batch and passed alone, batch contention), the 13-file cycle/trap/park/paint regression set after the engine changes (13/13), and the surface's own suites plus the chooser's other consumer — at0213, at0306, at0396, at0304, at0176, at0051 (6/6, 18/18). `bunx vite build`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, and `just app-test-covers-check` all green.

Two success criteria are **not** machine-closed and are the user's to walk: the ⌥⇥ vocabulary end to end on a deck with a bound session card, and ⌘. dismissal outside the app-test harness (the test covers it, but only on a foreground instance).

#### Step 1: Build TugModalInputDialog + gallery card; resolve [Q01] {#step-1}

**Commit:** `tugways(modal-input-dialog): app-modal typing-first input primitive borrowing TugAlert modality [L19][L25]`

**References:** [P01] borrow alert modality, [P02] typing-first, [P05] outside-click prop, [P08] fold-in, [P10] naming/orders, [Q01] Radix portal dropdown, Spec S01, Risk R01, (#current-code-map, #dismissal-inventory)

**Artifacts:**
- `tug-modal-input-dialog.tsx` / `.css`, gallery card + registration; the `portalContainer` / `overlaySlot` pass-throughs on `tug-combo-box.tsx` + `tug-file-chooser.tsx` ([P10]).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create the component per Spec S01: Radix Dialog shell copied from `tug-alert.tsx` (portal container, overlay, prevented auto-focus/Escape, `onCloseAutoFocus`, in-jail key sink, ⌘. via `isCancelChordEvent`, visually-hidden `Dialog.Title` + `aria-describedby={undefined}` so `DialogTitleWarning` never fires [P01]); field/list/provider internals migrated from `tug-completion-popup.tsx` (pull/subscribe loop, `renderLabel`, selected state + `scrollIntoView`, row `onMouseDown` preventDefault + click commit, `ATTACHED_LIST_ATTRIBUTE` on the field wrapper, `TugInput` with `focusGroup`/`focusOrder`, `useSeedKeyView`); trap `useFocusTrap({ active: true, deferDomFocusToTeardown: true, onEscapeDismiss: onDismiss, kbf: false })`. No `onBlur` dismissal, no backdrop mousedown handler, no `dismissGuard`, no app-lifecycle observer ([P06] puts that in the consumer).
- [ ] `dismissOnOutsideClick` wiring: `onInteractOutside` prevents by default; when the prop is set, dismiss.
- [ ] Chooser plumbing per [P10]: add the `portalContainer` pass-through to `TugComboBox` **and** `TugFileChooser` (absent ⇒ `useCanvasOverlay()`, so no existing caller moves), and make `TugFileChooser` forward `overlaySlot` instead of hardcoding it (`tug-file-chooser.tsx:233`), defaulting to `"tug-file-chooser-overlay"`.
- [ ] CSS: HUD panel/field/list/row/empty/match styles carried from `tug-completion-popup.css` under the new class names; overlay styled on the `tug-alert-overlay` pattern; the `--tugx-modal-input-*` family declared in `tug-modal-input-dialog.css` under its seven-slot header block ([P01], [L19]).
- [ ] Gallery card `gallery-modal-input-dialog.tsx` with a static in-memory provider and a `TugFileChooser` (menuMode, seed of a few fake paths, `portalContainer` = the dialog panel, `overlaySlot="tug-modal-input-dialog-chooser-overlay"`, orders per Table T01) in the header; register in `gallery-registrations.tsx`.
- [ ] **[Q01] probe in the running app** (gallery card): (a) click a row in the chooser's dropdown — the pick must land and the dialog must stay up; (b) click outside the panel — the dialog must dismiss and nothing beneath activates. Start at option 1 (dropdown portalled into the panel) and check the panel's list `overflow` does not clip it; fall back down [Q01]'s ranked list only on a failed probe. Record the chosen mechanism in the commit message.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Manual gallery pass across themes (component-authoring checklist); behavioral coverage lands with at0213/at0396 in #step-4.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build`
- [ ] [Q01] probe results recorded (both interactions correct in the gallery card, in the app)

---

#### Step 2: Move Open Quickly onto the primitive; chooser in, switcher out {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `tugways(open-quickly): rebuild on TugModalInputDialog; TugFileChooser scope row replaces the directory switcher [L02][L06][L29]`

**References:** [P05] outside-click, [P06] consumer-level resign dismiss, [P07] chooser replaces switcher, [P09] settle returns focus, [Q02] seed shaping, Table T01, (#current-code-map, #t01-focus-orders)

**Artifacts:**
- Rewritten `OpenQuicklyBody`; deleted switcher plumbing.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Replace the `TugCompletionPopup` render with `TugModalInputDialog` (`provider`, `onCommit` = existing `commit`, `onDismiss` = `closeOpenQuickly`, `placeholder` = existing leaf-name form, `emptyLabel` unchanged, `dismissOnOutsideClick`).
- [ ] Header: `TugFileChooser` with `value` = chooser text state (initialized to `activePath`), `base` = `activePath` (or `/`), `kind="directory"`, `menuMode`, `seed` = candidate seed built per [P07] (candidate list from the existing `rootCandidates` + `probeDirs` effect; full-path labels with match highlighting modeled on `buildRecentsSeed` in `session-card.tsx`, no trash affordance), `portalContainer`/`overlaySlot` per the [Q01] mechanism chosen in #step-1, `focusGroup={MODAL_INPUT_DIALOG_FOCUS_GROUP}`, `focusOrder={1}`, `browseFocusOrder={2}`.
- [ ] `onSettle`: **first** compare the settled path against the live `activePath` — equal (after normalization) means the settle was a blur, not a choice (`tug-combo-box.tsx:529-538`), so return without probing or re-seeding ([P09]). Otherwise probe via `probeDirs`; on exists, set `pickedPath` to the canonical form (workspace re-acquire effect is already keyed on `activePath`) and re-seed the key view onto the HUD input; on missing, leave scope unchanged.
- [ ] Add the app-resign dismissal observer to `OpenQuicklyBody` ([P06]) — the code moves verbatim from the old popup.
- [ ] Delete: the switcher JSX, `useResponderForm`/`ResponderScope` wiring, `switcherLabels`, `SWITCHER_MENU`, `dismissGuard`, the `candidates.length > 1` gate (the chooser always renders).
- [ ] Verify `⇧⌘O` end-to-end in the running app: open, type, commit, re-scope via chooser typing, via seed menu pick, via Browse.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Covered in #step-4; this step's checkpoint is build + live verification.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build`
- [ ] **User-verified gate (not machine-closable):** live app — all three re-scope paths work, a real scope change lands the caret back in the HUD input, and a bare Tab off the chooser does **not**. An autonomous `implement` run reports this step as built-and-building and stops here for the walk; the machine proof arrives with at0306/at0396 in #step-4.

---

#### Step 3: KBF adoption: ⌥⇥ over the dialog's stops; manual-bit hygiene {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `tugways(modal-input-dialog): dialog adopts KBF mode — ⌥⇥ engages over its own stops, bit cleared at close [focus-language P09/P12]`

**References:** [P03] KBF adoption, [P04] manual-bit hygiene, Table T01, Risk R02, (#p03-kbf-adoption, #p04-manual-bit-hygiene)

**Artifacts:**
- The [P04] capture/restore effect in `TugModalInputDialog`; at0396 test 3, resurrected; any fixes the live walk exposes.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement [P04]: capture `kbfManual()` at trap activation (the `FocusManagerContext` manager is already in scope via the trap's imports); on deactivate, `setKbfManual(captured)` unless `kbfManualClearedByPointer()` says the pointer already answered.
- [ ] Walk the whole vocabulary in the live app with a **bound session card behind the dialog** (the `1e86cd245` failure fixture): ⌥⇥ engages and rings inside the dialog (never the card behind); Tab/⇧Tab walk input → chooser → Browse; parked input: ↑/↓ drive the results (attached list), Enter claims the caret; ⌥⇥ from a parked stop disengages; Escape dismisses from any stop; after ⌥⇥-then-Escape, no ring anywhere on the deck.
- [ ] Fix what the walk exposes; diagnose in the app first (`/api/eval` on the live instance) per the brief's proof discipline.
- [ ] **Write at0396 test 3 now, in this step** (the `c6ef67aba` `test.todo`, resurrected per [P03]): bound session card behind the dialog, ⌥⇥ rings inside (assert `data-key-view-kbd` within the panel and its absence on the card), ⌥⇥ again disengages, and after ⌥⇥ + Escape no `data-kbf` on `<html>`. The KBF step carries its own falsifiable proof rather than borrowing one from #step-4 — this is the step whose checkpoint would otherwise be a memory of a walk.
- [ ] Probe it red first: patch out the [P04] restore and watch the no-ring-after-dismiss clause fail (`tugutil file probe`); note the probe in the test header docblock.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `tests/app-test/at0396-open-quickly-arrows.test.ts` test 3 (tests 1–2 are rewritten in #step-4).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build`
- [ ] `just app-test tests/app-test/at0396-open-quickly-arrows.test.ts` — test 3 green, and red under the [P04] reverse patch
- [ ] **User-verified gate (not machine-closable):** the full live walk above, on a deck with a bound session card — the test pins the ring's location and the bit's fate, not the whole vocabulary

---

#### Step 4: Rewrite at0213 / at0306 / at0396 against the new surface {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `tugways(open-quickly): app-tests cover the modal dialog — dismissal, chooser re-scope, KBF adoption`

**References:** [P03] KBF adoption, [P04] bit hygiene, [P05] outside-click, [P07] chooser, Risk R02, Table T01, (#success-criteria, #test-non-goals)

**Artifacts:**
- Updated `tests/app-test/at0213-open-quickly.test.ts`, `at0306-open-quickly-default-dir.test.ts`, `at0396-open-quickly-arrows.test.ts`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] New selectors throughout: panel `[data-slot="tug-modal-input-dialog"]`, input `.tug-modal-input-dialog-input`, rows via `[data-slot="tug-modal-input-dialog-list"]`, chooser via its slot ([P10]).
- [ ] at0213: open/typing/commit unchanged in spirit; Escape dismisses; outside click dismisses **and** the surface beneath did not activate; add ⌘. dismissal.
- [ ] at0306: default-dir fallback unchanged; replace the switcher-menu interactions with chooser interactions — seed-menu pick re-scopes (a file unique to the second directory becomes findable), typed-path settle re-scopes, missing-path settle does not.
- [ ] at0396: test 1 (↓ on empty query selects first result) and test 2 (Tab from the HUD input reaches the chooser field, then Browse…) rewritten. Test 3 already landed in #step-3.
- [ ] Probe every new behavioral assertion red first (`tugutil file probe` with a reverse patch — patch out the [P09] changed-only guard and watch at0396 test 2's Browse… landing fail; patch out the [Q01] mechanism and watch at0306's dropdown-pick clause fail). Note each probe in the test header docblock.
- [ ] Update the three files' `@covers` lines to `tug-modal-input-dialog.tsx` (keeping `open-quickly-overlay.tsx` and friends).

**Tests:**
- [ ] The three files themselves.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `just app-test tests/app-test/at0213-open-quickly.test.ts tests/app-test/at0306-open-quickly-default-dir.test.ts tests/app-test/at0396-open-quickly-arrows.test.ts`
- [ ] Each listed probe went red before the final green

---

#### Step 5: Retire TugCompletionPopup; sweep `@covers`; update doctrine {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `tugways(completion-popup): retire TugCompletionPopup — TugModalInputDialog is the typing-first modal surface [focus-language updated]`

**References:** [P08] fold-and-retire, (#symbols, #assumptions)

**Artifacts:**
- Deleted `tug-completion-popup.tsx`/`.css`, `src/__tests__/switcher-labels.test.ts`; updated doctrine and `@covers` lines.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Delete `tug-completion-popup.tsx` and `.css`; remove the `TugCompletionPopup` doc-comment reference in `use-focus-trap.tsx` (points at the new component now).
- [ ] Delete `src/__tests__/switcher-labels.test.ts` (its subject died in #step-2).
- [ ] `@covers` sweep: remove the `tug-completion-popup.tsx` lines from at0051/at0103/at0176 after confirming each never mounts Open Quickly (per #assumptions — if one genuinely exercises the surface, repoint it to `tug-modal-input-dialog.tsx` instead); at0052/at0053/at0054 checked the same way.
- [ ] Update `tuglaws/focus-language.md`: the typing-first carve-out row and the "next typing-first HUD" paragraph now name `TugModalInputDialog` (and its `kbf: false` site); the ⌥⇥-inside-a-trap behavior gains the dialog as its worked example. Re-run the doctrine's own grep audit (`setKbfManual|toggleKbfManual|clearKbfManualForPointer|kbfAtRest|kbf: false|hasEngagingTrap`) so every table row still names a real site — the [P04] clear is a new `setKbfManual` site the table must carry.
- [ ] Grep the repo for any remaining `tug-completion-popup` / `TugCompletionPopup` / `COMPLETION_POPUP_` references; zero must remain outside git history and this plan.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `just app-test-covers-check` (every `@covers` path resolves)

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build`
- [ ] `just app-test-covers-check`
- [ ] `command grep -rn "TugCompletionPopup\|tug-completion-popup" tugdeck/src tests/ tuglaws/` returns nothing

---

#### Step 6: Integration Checkpoint {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-4, #step-5

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [P01]–[P10], (#success-criteria, #exit-criteria)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Full derived selection over the working diff; confirm every success criterion in #success-criteria against the run and the live app.

**Tests:**
- [ ] `just app-test-changed` (selection derived from the diff via `@covers`; run bare, never piped)

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `just app-test-changed` — VERDICT green
- [ ] `cd tugdeck && bunx vite build`

---

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** Open Quickly is an app-modal `TugModalInputDialog` with a `TugFileChooser` scope row, adopting the KBF mode design; `TugCompletionPopup` and the directory-switcher popup no longer exist.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] Every criterion in #success-criteria verified (at0213/at0306/at0396 green, probes noted red-first)
- [ ] `bunx vite build` and `just app-test-covers-check` pass with the old component deleted
- [ ] `tuglaws/focus-language.md` names the new component in the typing-first carve-out and its site tables pass their grep audit

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] at0213, at0306, at0396 (rewritten)
- [ ] `just app-test-changed` over the final diff

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}
