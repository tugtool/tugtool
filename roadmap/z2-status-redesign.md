## Z2 Status Redesign — Configurable Row + Shelf {#z2-status-redesign}

**Purpose:** Productionize the `gallery-z2-workshop` design spike: the Z2 status row
becomes a user-configurable instrument row (macOS-toolbar grammar), a height-stable
pinned **shelf** of TASKS / JOBS / PULSE lanes opens beneath it, and PULSE surfaces
exactly once across its three possible homes — all persisted through tugbank.

### Phase Overview {#phase-overview}

#### Context {#context}

The Z2 status row ships today as a fixed six-cell instrument row (STATE, TIME,
TOKENS, CONTEXT, TASKS, JOBS — `DevTelemetryStatusRow` over `TugStatusCell`), with a
trailing maximize toggle and a balancing lead spacer in `dev-card.tsx`. The
`gallery-z2-workshop` spike settled, over four review rounds, a richer design: the
row's items become configurable (drag to add/remove/reorder, with SPACE / FLEX SPACE
spacers and a flexible PULSE item); a chevron at the row's end opens a pinned shelf
of up to three lanes (TASKS, JOBS, PULSE) that steals fixed height from the
transcript; a gear opens an in-place configurator (Finder "Customize Toolbar…"
translated — the live surface IS the editor, with palettes directly beneath each
section); and chrome rearranges (maximize to the LEFT end, gear inboard right,
chevron at the very end).

This plan carries that design into the production dev card. It follows the PULSE
plan (`roadmap/pulse.md`), which ships the `pulse-store`, the `tide-pulse-strip`
component, and the `pulse/enabled` toggle this plan's PULSE row item, PULSE lane,
and strip-suppression rule all consume — and which explicitly deferred Shelf/Rack
productionization here (its [Q03] and non-goals).

#### Strategy {#strategy}

- **Config first, then consumers.** One validated, tugbank-persisted config object
  (row order, lane arrangement, shelf disposition) lands first as a pure-logic
  module; every surface reads it through the established `useTugbankValue` path.
- **Refactor the row in place, prove zero drift.** `DevTelemetryStatusRow` keeps its
  name, cells, popovers, and focus contract; it changes from a hardcoded six-cell
  JSX block to a registry rendered in configured order. The default config must
  render the row pixel-identical before anything new ships.
- **Extract the status area as one component.** The row chrome, the PULSE strip slot,
  the shelf, and the configurator compose into `DevCardStatusArea`, replacing the
  status-bar block inline in `dev-card.tsx` — the card body keeps only `maximized`.
- **Spike code is the reference implementation.** The drag grammar (ghost, caret,
  dim), shelf geometry, lane focus affordance, and single-surface rule port from
  `gallery-z2-workshop.tsx/.css` with production data swapped in; the card itself
  stays untouched as the design record.
- **Height stability is a contract, not a vibe.** The open shelf never changes
  height with data; every configurator surface is fixed-height; the suppressed strip
  keeps its slot while customizing.

#### Success Criteria (Measurable) {#success-criteria}

- With no stored config, the Z2 row renders the same six cells, widths, popovers,
  and focus cycle as before this plan — verified by visual walk + the existing cell
  popovers + Tab cycle. (Live walk; `bunx tsc --noEmit`; `bun test`.)
- Dragging an item out of / into / within the row updates the live row immediately
  and survives a hard reload (config re-read from tugbank DEFAULTS push). (Live walk.)
- The chevron opens a shelf whose height never changes while open — 5 data rows per
  lane + legend + footer — regardless of task/job/pulse counts; lane focus
  expand/contract works with ≥2 lanes. (Live walk; CSS fixed-height inspection.)
- PULSE renders in exactly one place at any moment: row item, else open-shelf lane,
  else the strip; disabling `pulse/enabled` blanks all three to their off states.
  (Live walk through all three homes; pure-logic test on the resolver.)
- Overflow counts in the shelf footer open the corresponding TASKS / JOBS popover
  with full controls; the PULSE count is inert. (Live walk.)
- Restore Defaults returns row + lanes + shelf to the shipped defaults and persists
  that. (Live walk + reload.)
- `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `bun test`, and the app-test sweep green at every step
  boundary.

#### Scope {#scope}

1. `status-area-config` module: schema, defaults, validation, tugbank persistence
   (domain `dev.tugtool.deck.status-area`), read hook + write helper.
2. `DevTelemetryStatusRow` refactor: cell registry, config-ordered rendering,
   SPACE / FLEX SPACE spacer cells, the PULSE row cell (flexible width, live
   `pulse-store` line, dimmed-off when disabled), config-derived focus orders.
3. `DevCardStatusArea`: extracted Z2 composite — chrome rearrangement (maximize
   left, gear inboard right, chevron at end), strip slot with the single-surface
   suppression rule, shelf + configurator mounts; `dev-card.tsx` swap.
4. `DevCardStatusShelf`: height-stable lanes (TASKS / JOBS / PULSE), lane focus
   affordance, sixth footer row with clickable overflow counts.
5. The in-place configurator: customize mode, per-section palettes, drag visuals
   (ghost / caret / source-dim), lane editing in the shelf, config footer.
6. `tuglaws/design-decisions.md` entry.

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Any change to the PULSE pipeline itself (daemon, facts, ledger, store) — this plan
  is purely a consumer of what `roadmap/pulse.md` ships.
- Per-card scope filtering of the PULSE lane/strip — carried from pulse [Q03],
  deferred again here with rationale ([Q02]).
- New row datums beyond the spike vocabulary (cost, TTFT, etc.) — the registry makes
  them cheap later; none ship now.
- Reworking the `tugDevPlacement` dev harness — it keeps working; `statusRow`
  remains the default Z2 datum and now resolves to the configurable row.
- Maintaining `gallery-z2-workshop` in lockstep — the card remains as the design
  record; no changes to it are required by this plan.
- Touch/pointer-event drag fallbacks — HTML5 dnd only, as spiked (it runs in the
  app's WKWebView today).

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- **`roadmap/pulse.md` implemented** — `pulse-store.ts` (snapshot: recent lines +
  `enabled`), `tide-pulse-strip.tsx/.css`, and the `pulse/enabled` tugbank default.
  The PULSE row cell, PULSE lane, and strip suppression all read these.
- The jobs ledger + monitors work (shipped on main): `useJobsState`, `countJobs`,
  `jobsCellPose`, the JOBS popover.
- The task list machinery: `useTaskListState`, `countTasks`, the TASKS popover.
- Tugbank deck plumbing: `useTugbankValue`, `getTugbankClient().setLocalValue` + PUT
  (the placement-experiment write pattern in `dev-card-placement-experiment.tsx`).
- The spike: `gallery-z2-workshop.tsx/.css` (reference implementation for drag
  grammar, shelf geometry, configurator layout).

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- bun only; tugdeck is HMR (no manual builds). No localStorage-family storage —
  config lives in tugbank ([P01]).
- Tuglaws: [L02] external state via `useSyncExternalStore`; [L06] appearance via
  CSS/DOM; [L16] color-rule pairing; [L19] `.tsx`/`.css` pairs with `data-slot`;
  [L20] token sovereignty; [L26] mount identity. No fake-DOM / mock-store tests.
- Labels stay on — there is no "value only" display mode (user-decided in the
  spike rounds; the configurator hint states it).
- Buttons with state-dependent content reserve the wider state's width; icons beside
  multi-line text align with the top text row.

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- HTML5 drag-and-drop (setDragImage ghost, dragover/drop) behaves in the Tug.app
  WKWebView as it did during the spike rounds (the workshop card already exercises
  the identical code paths in-app).
- The existing per-priority `@container` collapse rungs remain acceptable for
  non-default row configurations in v1 ([P10]).
- One app-global config is the right scope — all dev cards share the same Z2
  arrangement, like a macOS app's toolbar config ([P01]).

### Open Questions (MUST RESOLVE OR EXPLICITLY DEFER) {#open-questions}

#### [Q01] PULSE history surface (DEFERRED) {#q01-pulse-history}

**Question:** Should clicking the PULSE lane's overflow count (or the strip/cell)
open a pulse-history popover, the way TASKS/JOBS counts open theirs?

**Why it matters:** Symmetry in the footer; but pulse lines are ambient commentary,
not actionable items, and no popover content component exists for them.

**Resolution:** DEFERRED — the PULSE overflow count renders as inert text in v1
([P07]). If history-on-demand earns its keep, it's a small follow-on (a popover over
the pulse-store tail) requiring no architecture change.

#### [Q02] Per-card scope filtering of PULSE surfaces (DEFERRED) {#q02-scope-filtering}

**Question:** Should a card's PULSE lane/strip filter to the card's own session
scope? (Carried from `roadmap/pulse.md` [Q03], which deferred it to this plan.)

**Why it matters:** With multiple live cards, an app-wide feed narrates other cards'
work into every card's shelf.

**Resolution:** DEFERRED again, deliberately — v1 shows the app-wide feed in all
three homes, consistent with the pulse plan's strip. Every pulse line already
carries `scope`, so filtering is a pure display knob; building it before real
multi-card usage shows the need would be speculative. Revisit when multi-card
sessions are routine.

#### [Q03] Shelf open/close animation (DECIDED — none in v1) {#q03-shelf-animation}

**Question:** Does the shelf animate open/closed?

**Resolution:** DECIDED — no animation in v1; the shelf mounts/unmounts at its fixed
height on chevron toggle ([P05]). A height transition is a CSS-only refinement that
can land later without structural change.

---

### Risks and Mitigations {#risks}

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Trigger to revisit |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| Row refactor regresses cell popovers / focus cycle | med | low | Registry preserves each cell's JSX verbatim; default-config render proven identical before new items ship (#step-2 checkpoint) | Any popover/focus diff in the live walk |
| Config-driven rows fight the static collapse rungs | low | med | Keep rungs as-is ([P10]); flexible PULSE cell ellipsizes; configurator hint nudges restraint | A configured row that clips at common widths |
| HTML5 dnd quirks in WKWebView | med | low | The spike card already runs the identical dnd code in-app; verify the production surfaces in Tug.app at #step-5's checkpoint | Ghost/caret misbehavior in the app build |
| Chrome rearrangement breaks cell centering | low | med | Spec S02 pins the balance rule (left flank = maximize + spacer; right flank = gear + chevron) | Visible off-center drift |

**Risk R01: Stored config drifts from the vocabulary** {#r01-config-drift}

- **Risk:** A stored config references an item/lane a future build renames or
  removes, or holds malformed JSON.
- **Mitigation:** `parseStatusAreaConfig` drops unknown ids, dedupes non-repeatable
  items, caps lanes at 3, and falls back field-wise to defaults; a `version` field
  reserves room for future migration. Pure-logic tests pin every salvage path.
- **Residual risk:** A renamed id silently reverts that item to "not configured" —
  acceptable; Restore Defaults always recovers.

---

### Design Decisions {#design-decisions}

#### [P01] One app-global config object, tugbank-persisted (DECIDED) {#p01-config-object}

**Decision:** The entire status-area arrangement persists as one `kind:"json"`
tugbank value — domain `dev.tugtool.deck.status-area`, key `config` — holding
`{ version, row, lanes, shelfOpen }` (Spec S01). It is app-global: every dev card
shares the one arrangement.

**Rationale:**
- The placement experiment already proved the exact mechanism: `useTugbankValue`
  read (reference-stable parse cache, [L02]) + `setLocalValue` optimistic write +
  PUT to `/api/defaults/<domain>/<key>`. No new plumbing.
- macOS toolbar configuration is per-app, not per-window — the spike's stated model.
- One object keeps row/lanes/shelf mutually consistent (a single Restore Defaults,
  a single parse).

**Implications:**
- New `status-area-config.ts` module owns the schema, defaults, validation, hook,
  and write helper; everything else imports from it.
- `shelfOpen` is persisted disposition — pinning the shelf survives reload. And it
  is app-global like the rest of the object: toggling the chevron on one card opens
  the shelf on every dev card (macOS-toolbar conduct) — intended behavior, not a
  bug to file later.
- Writes are live-per-mutation (each drop/removal persists immediately, like the
  placement experiment); Done only exits customize mode.

#### [P02] The row stays `DevTelemetryStatusRow`, rendered from a cell registry (DECIDED) {#p02-cell-registry}

**Decision:** `DevTelemetryStatusRow` is refactored, not replaced: a module-level
registry maps each `StatusRowItemId` to its cell renderer, and the component maps
the configured `row` array over it. The item vocabulary is the spike's: `state`,
`time`, `tokens`, `context`, `tasks`, `jobs`, `pulse`, `space`, `flex` — spacers
repeatable, everything else one-shot, `pulse` and `flex` flexible-width.

**Rationale:**
- The six existing cells (data wiring, popovers, widths, `data-priority`) are
  proven; the refactor moves JSX into registry entries verbatim instead of
  rewriting it.
- A registry makes future datums additive (one entry), honoring the placement
  experiment's "renderers are placement-agnostic" doctrine.

**Implications:**
- Default config renders byte-identical DOM to today's row — the #step-2 gate.
- The PULSE cell is new: flexible width (`flex: 1 1 auto`, min-width, ellipsis —
  the one deviation from fixed-width cell grammar), value = newest pulse line from
  `pulse-store`, no popover in v1 ([Q01]); when `pulse/enabled` is false it renders
  a dimmed "off" placeholder rather than vanishing (config stays WYSIWYG).
- SPACE renders a fixed-gap cell, FLEX SPACE a flexing one; both render a quiet
  glyph only while customizing (invisible spacers otherwise).
- Focus orders derive from the configured order (`focusOrderBase + index over
  non-spacer items`); spacer cells are never focus stops. The `/context` imperative
  handle no-ops when no `context` cell is configured (null ref — already the
  handle's contract).

#### [P03] Extract `DevCardStatusArea` as the one Z2 composite (DECIDED) {#p03-status-area-component}

**Decision:** A new `dev-card-status-area.tsx/.css` owns the whole Z2 area: the
status-bar row (maximize at the LEFT end, the Z2 content in a `CycleScope`, the
configure gear inboard right, the shelf chevron at the very end — Spec S02), the
PULSE strip slot with the single-surface rule ([P04]), the shelf ([P05]), and the
customize mode ([P08]). `dev-card.tsx` replaces its inline status-bar block
(lead-spacer + main + trailing maximize) with this component, passing `maximized` +
toggle, the resolved Z2 content node, the stores, and the cycle scope.

**Rationale:**
- `dev-card.tsx` is already ~3500 lines; the status area is a coherent [L19]
  component with its own CSS scope.
- The shelf must be a flex sibling *below* the bar inside `dev-card-top-column`
  (the transcript host is `flex: 1 1 auto`, so a content-sized shelf steals height
  from it for free — the exact mechanism the spike documents). One component owns
  that sibling group.
- The pulse plan mounts `tide-pulse-strip` under the status row in `dev-card.tsx`;
  this plan relocates that mount inside the status area so the suppression rule
  ([P04]) computes next to its inputs.

**Implications:**
- `maximized` state stays in `DevCardBody` ([L06], session-only) — the area only
  renders the button.
- Customize state (`customizing`) lives in `DevCardStatusArea` (local structural
  mode, `useState`). It reaches the row — whose node is *created by the placement
  harness* (`useDevPlacementSlots` → `sessionNode("statusRow")`) and arrives as a
  finished `statusBarContent` ReactNode, so props cannot reach it — through the
  tolerant `StatusAreaCustomizeContext` bridge (Spec S06).
- When the dev-only placement harness puts a non-`statusRow` datum in Z2, the gear
  and chevron still render and configure the (hidden) row — an accepted dev-only
  quirk, documented in the component docstring.

#### [P04] PULSE single-surface rule (DECIDED) {#p04-single-surface}

**Decision:** PULSE renders in exactly one place, by priority: configured row item →
PULSE lane in the *open* shelf → the ambient strip. The strip is the fallback, never
a duplicate. While customizing, the strip's slot stays mounted at fixed height with
a placeholder note when suppressed ("in the status row — the strip stands down" /
"pinned on the shelf — the strip stands down"), so moving PULSE between homes never
shifts the configurator. With `pulse/enabled` false: the strip hides (pulse plan
behavior), and the row cell / lane render dimmed off-placeholders.

**Rationale:** Settled in the spike rounds — duplication reads as a bug; the
closed-shelf case must fall back to the strip so commentary is never silently lost.

**Implications:** A pure resolver — `resolvePulseSurface(config, shelfOpen,
customizing, pulseEnabled)` → `"row" | "shelf" | "strip" | "none"` — lives in
`status-area-config.ts` and is unit-tested exhaustively; the components just render
its answer.

#### [P05] Shelf geometry: fixed 5-row lanes + legend + footer (DECIDED) {#p05-shelf-geometry}

**Decision:** The open shelf is a fixed-height band: each lane shows a legend row
plus exactly `SHELF_LANE_ROWS = 5` data-row slots (uniform row height; empty slots
stay reserved), and a sixth full-width footer row carries overflow counts +
controls ([P07]). Up to 3 lanes side by side. The shelf mounts when open (chevron
or customize), unmounts when closed; no animation ([Q03]). Lane data: TASKS =
`useTaskListState` rows, JOBS = `useJobsState` rows (dot + description + kind/elapsed
meta), PULSE = the pulse-store tail's last 5 lines.

**Rationale:** Height stability was the user's first structural requirement
("must *always* be height-stable once configured"); the transcript-flex sibling
mechanism gives the height-steal for free.

**Implications:**
- Shelf height is a CSS calc over row-height constants — data volume never moves it.
- Lane focus (click a legend to expand one lane, others contract to a peek column;
  chevrons-apart / chevrons-together affordance; disabled under 2 lanes; paused
  while customizing) ports from the spike: local `useState` for the focused lane id
  driving `data-focus`, flex widths in CSS ([L06]). Focus resets when the shelf
  unmounts — acceptable.
- Overflow (rows beyond 5) is *counted* in the footer, never scrolled in the lane.

#### [P06] Drag grammar: the spike's HTML5-dnd port of the tab-bar visuals (DECIDED) {#p06-drag-grammar}

**Decision:** All four drag interactions (palette→row, row reorder, palette→shelf,
lane reorder) use the spike's *visual* grammar — a transient styled clone passed to
`setDragImage` (the tab bar's ghost, `.tug-tab-ghost` tokens), the drag source
dimmed via `data-dragging` + CSS opacity, an absolute 2px insertion caret gliding
via `transition: left` — with the *mechanism* corrected to the codebase's real
precedent: the caret is created and positioned by **direct DOM mutation** in the
dragover handler (the `updateInsertionIndicator` pattern in
`card-drag-coordinator.ts`), the drag payload rides `dataTransfer` (Spec S06), and
dragover/drop handlers are delegated on the area's containers. `startDragGhost` and
`computeInsertion` port from the spike unchanged; the spike's `useState` caret does
not — that was its one shortcut.

**Rationale:** Already designed, reviewed, and exercised in-app across the spike
rounds; visually consistent with the deck tab bar's established drag language —
whose actual implementation (`card-drag-coordinator.ts`) positions its ghost and
insertion indicator with imperative DOM writes and runs no React state in the
pointer loop. A `useState` caret would re-render the whole status area at
pointer-move frequency and strain [L06].

**Implications:** The caret element lives outside React — created on first dragover
over a container, moved by `style.left` writes, removed on dragleave / drop /
dragend; only the drop *commit* enters React, as a config write ([P01]).
`data-dragging` stays a render-driven attribute (one flip per drag start/end — the
`data-maximized` shape).

#### [P07] Shelf footer: clickable overflow counts, no separate buttons (DECIDED) {#p07-footer}

**Decision:** The sixth row shows per-lane overflow counts ("jobs +2") when a lane
holds more rows than its 5-slot budget. TASKS and JOBS counts are buttons — each is
its own `TugPopover` trigger reusing the existing `TasksPopoverContent` /
`JobsPopoverContent` (full list, stop/clear controls), anchored at the footer. The
PULSE count is inert text ([Q01]). No More… / Clear buttons — the popovers remain
the single control surface. The footer row is always present while the shelf is
open (height stability), rendering quiet whitespace when nothing overflows.

**Rationale:** User-decided (devise clarification). Anchoring fresh popover
instances at the footer — rather than imperatively opening the row cells' popovers
— keeps the footer working even when the corresponding cell isn't configured into
the row.

**Implications:** The popover content components get reused with a second anchor;
their props (`onStopJob`, `onClearJobs`, `onScrollToRow`) thread through the shelf.

#### [P08] In-place configurator, live writes (DECIDED) {#p08-configurator}

**Decision:** The gear toggles `customizing`. While customizing: the shelf is
forced open; row cells and shelf lanes grow grips + per-item `×` removal; each
section's palette renders as a fixed-height single-line strip directly beneath that
section (row palette under the row, lane palette under the shelf — no separate
schematic); a config footer carries the hint ("Labels stay on — bare values mostly
lose their meaning."), Restore Defaults, and Done. Every mutation persists
immediately ([P01]); Done exits the mode; Restore Defaults writes the shipped
defaults. Double-click on a palette chip appends (the spike's affordance).

**Rationale:** The "options directly under the sections they edit" structure was
the final spike round's explicit correction; live writes match both macOS toolbar
behavior and the placement-experiment precedent.

**Implications:** The zero-lane shelf state keeps the lane band's full height and
stays a drop target; the suppressed strip keeps its slot ([P04]); palettes show
"all placed" text when empty — every customize surface is height-stable. Row-side
edit affordances and removals reach the slot-rendered row through
`StatusAreaCustomizeContext`, and cross-component drops decode the `dataTransfer`
payload in the area's delegated handlers (Spec S06).

#### [P09] Focus + chrome conduct (DECIDED) {#p09-focus-chrome}

**Decision:** The configured cells join the card's focus cycle as consecutive leaf
stops from `focusOrderBase`, in configured order, spacers skipped ([P02]). The
maximize, gear, and chevron buttons are chrome — `data-tug-focus`-conformant,
never cycle stops (exactly the current maximize's conduct). The bar keeps cells
centered: the left flank (maximize + one button-width spacer) balances the right
flank (gear + chevron) per Spec S02.

**Rationale:** The existing leaf-stop cycle semantics (the "[P10] revised" cited in
the row's code comments — a *prior* plan's label, not this plan's [P10]) already
treat the cells as consecutive leaf stops; deriving orders from config is the
minimal generalization.
Chrome buttons staying off the cycle preserves the editor-first responder doctrine.

**Implications:** Reordering the row reorders Tab traversal to match left→right
visual order automatically — no per-cell order bookkeeping. Reordering also changes
each cell's `group:order` focus-restoration key (`data-tug-focus-key`) — expected
conduct, not a defect; a restore against a stale key simply falls back to the
default seed.

#### [P10] Container-collapse rungs stay static in v1 (DECIDED) {#p10-collapse-rungs}

**Decision:** The existing per-priority `@container dev-status` rungs (TIME 460px →
TOKENS 290px → TASKS 230px → JOBS 180px) are kept untouched. New cells: the PULSE
cell shrinks/ellipsizes (flexible) rather than hiding; spacers collapse naturally.
No config-aware rung computation ships.

**Rationale:** The rungs are per-cell and independent — each hides its cell at its
threshold whether or not the others are present. Config-aware thresholds would be
real complexity for a narrow-card edge the user can also solve by configuring a
shorter row.

**Implications:** A maximal custom row can crowd narrow cards; the flexible PULSE
cell absorbs most of it. Watch-item, revisit on evidence.

### Specification {#specification}

**Spec S01: Config schema + validation** {#s01-config-schema}

```jsonc
// tugbank: domain "dev.tugtool.deck.status-area", key "config", kind "json"
{
  "version": 1,
  "row":   ["state", "time", "tokens", "context", "tasks", "jobs"],  // default
  "lanes": ["tasks", "jobs", "pulse"],                                // default; max 3
  "shelfOpen": false                                                  // default
}
```

Types: `StatusRowItemId = "state" | "time" | "tokens" | "context" | "tasks" |
"jobs" | "pulse" | "space" | "flex"`; `ShelfLaneId = "tasks" | "jobs" | "pulse"`.
`parseStatusAreaConfig(entry: TaggedValue | undefined): StatusAreaConfig` salvages
field-wise: unknown ids dropped; non-repeatable duplicates dropped (first wins;
`space`/`flex` repeat freely); lanes deduped and capped at 3; missing/malformed
fields → that field's default; `undefined` entry → full defaults. The parse is
total — it never throws.

**Spec S02: Z2 bar chrome layout** {#s02-bar-chrome}

```
[Maximize] [spacer₁ᵇ]  ····· configured cells, centered ·····  [Gear] [Chevron]
```

Left flank = maximize button + one button-width spacer; right flank = gear +
chevron; equal flank widths keep the cell group centered (replacing today's
lead-spacer-balances-trailing-maximize rule). Gear: lucide `Settings`, `ghost`
emphasis, `tinted` while customizing. Chevron: `ChevronDown` when open /
`ChevronUp` when closed, toggles `shelfOpen` (persisted). Maximize keeps its
current button styling and [L06] conduct, relocated. The bar retains
`data-tug-focus="refuse"`, the `CycleScope`, and the `:empty`-collapse behavior
for a null Z2 slot.

**Spec S03: Single-surface resolution** {#s03-single-surface}

```
resolvePulseSurface(config, shelfOpen, customizing, pulseEnabled):
  effectiveShelfOpen = shelfOpen || customizing
  if (!pulseEnabled)                                   → "none"
  if (config.row includes "pulse")                     → "row"
  if (effectiveShelfOpen && config.lanes has "pulse")  → "shelf"
  else                                                 → "strip"
```

The strip renders only on `"strip"`; while customizing and suppressed, the strip
slot renders the placeholder variant at identical height ([P04]). The row cell and
shelf lane always render when configured — with live text when they're the active
surface and `pulseEnabled`, dimmed-off placeholder when `!pulseEnabled`.

**Spec S04: Shelf geometry** {#s04-shelf-geometry}

Band height = `legend-row + 5 × data-row + footer-row` (CSS constants; the spike's
`calc(5 * 20px + 22px)` + 24px footer adapted to production tokens). Lanes split
the band width evenly; focused lane takes `flex: 4`, others `flex: 0 0 <peek>`.
Data rows: uniform single-line typography (dot/meta + text, ellipsized) — the
spike's `.z2ws-lane-item` grammar under production class names
(`dev-status-shelf-*`). Empty lane: centered quiet placeholder at full band height.
Zero lanes: the band keeps its height, shows the "drag some in below" note, and
remains a drop target while customizing.

**Spec S05: Drag visuals** {#s05-drag-visuals}

`startDragGhost(e, label)`: create a styled clone (`.dev-status-drag-ghost`, tab-bar
ghost tokens), `setDragImage(ghost, 14, 14)`, remove next tick.
`computeInsertion(container, itemSelector, clientX) → {index, x}`: midpoint math;
caret x = target item's left edge − 2px, or last item's right edge + 2px for
append. Caret: absolute 2px bar, accent fill token, `transition: left calc(120ms *
var(--tug-timing, 1))` — **positioned by direct DOM mutation**: the dragover handler
creates/moves the caret element imperatively and writes `style.left` (the
`updateInsertionIndicator` mechanism in `card-drag-coordinator.ts` — the tab bar's
real grammar), and removes it on dragleave / drop / dragend. No React state at
pointer frequency ([L06]). Source dim: `[data-dragging]` → opacity 0.3
(render-driven attribute — one flip per drag start/end). Identical for row items
and shelf lanes.

**Spec S06: The customize/drag bridge** {#s06-customize-bridge}

The row's node is created by the placement harness (`useDevPlacementSlots` →
`sessionNode("statusRow")`) and arrives at `DevCardStatusArea` as a finished
ReactNode — props cannot reach it. Three mechanisms bridge the boundary:

1. **`StatusAreaCustomizeContext`** (exported from `status-area-config.ts`, which
   already imports React for its hook): `{ customizing: boolean,
   removeRowItem(index: number): void } | null`, provided by `DevCardStatusArea`,
   consumed by `DevTelemetryStatusRow` for the edit affordances (grips, per-cell
   `×`, spacer glyphs, `draggable`). The `null` default means "never customizing" —
   gallery and fixture renders are unchanged.
2. **Drag payload on `dataTransfer`**: drag sources call
   `setData("application/x-tug-status-item", JSON.stringify({source, index}))`
   (`source: "row-palette" | "row" | "lane-palette" | "shelf"`). HTML5 dnd events
   traverse component boundaries natively; the payload is read with `getData` at
   drop (dragover needs only position, never the payload). No shared refs between
   palette and row.
3. **Delegated `dragover`/`drop` handlers on the area's containers** (the bar's
   cell row, the shelf's lane band): `computeInsertion` resolves positions by
   selector (`.dev-telemetry-status-cell` / the lane class), so the drop target
   never cares which component rendered the items.

#### State Zone Mapping (tugdeck/tugways plans) {#state-zone-mapping}

| State | Zone (appearance / local-data / structure) | Mechanism | Law |
|-------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----|
| status-area config (row / lanes / shelfOpen) | external config | `useTugbankValue` + `setLocalValue`/PUT write helper (placement-experiment pattern) | [L02] |
| `customizing` | local structural mode | `useState` in `DevCardStatusArea`, bridged to the slot-rendered row via `StatusAreaCustomizeContext` (Spec S06) | — |
| `maximized` | session-only appearance (existing) | stays in `DevCardBody`; `data-maximized` + CSS | [L06] |
| pulse line / enabled (read) | external app state | `pulse-store` via `useSyncExternalStore` (pulse plan) | [L02] |
| lane focus (which lane expanded) | local-data → appearance | `useState` lane id → `data-focus` attr; flex in CSS | [L06] |
| drag source dim | appearance | `data-dragging` attr + CSS rule | [L06] |
| insertion caret | appearance (DOM-transient) | imperative element + `style.left` writes in dragover handlers (the `card-drag-coordinator` mechanism); glide via CSS transition | [L06] |
| drag ghost | DOM-transient | imperative clone + `setDragImage`, removed next tick | [L06] |
| strip suppression / surface choice | derived | pure `resolvePulseSurface` computed in render | — |
| shelf mount | structure | conditional on `shelfOpen ∥ customizing` (user-driven) | [L26] (stable while open) |

### Documentation Plan {#documentation-plan}

- [ ] `tuglaws/design-decisions.md`: new entry for the configurable Z2 status area
      (config object + single-surface rule + shelf geometry + chrome order),
      amending the Z2 zone notes ([D100]-family context).
- [ ] Docstring in `gallery-z2-workshop.tsx` gains one line noting the design
      shipped (pointer to the production components) — the card stays as the record.

### Test Plan Concepts {#test-plan-concepts}

#### Test Categories {#test-categories}

| Category | Purpose | When to use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Unit (pure-logic bun:test)** | `parseStatusAreaConfig` salvage paths (unknown ids, dupes, caps, malformed JSON, undefined); `resolvePulseSurface` truth table; focus-order derivation over configs with spacers; `computeInsertion` midpoint/append math | `status-area-config.ts`, renderers helpers |
| **Real-app (`just app-test`)** | only if a focus-cycle regression demands one — the cycle behavior is otherwise covered by the existing app-test suite running green | `tests/app-test/` |
| **Live walk (not CI)** | drag interactions, shelf height stability, single-surface transitions, persistence across reload, chrome centering | every UI step's checkpoint |

#### What stays out of tests {#test-non-goals}

- Drag-and-drop event choreography — browser-behavior; verified live (a fake-DOM
  harness is banned and pointless here).
- Render-output assertions on the row/shelf — no fake-DOM/RTL; the default-config
  no-drift gate is a live visual walk plus unchanged cell code.
- Mock-store call-count tests on the write helper — banned pattern; the placement
  experiment's write path is already proven.

#### Step 1: Config module {#step-1}

**Commit:** `Add tugbank-persisted status-area config module`

**References:** [P01] config object, [P04] single-surface, Spec S01, Spec S03,
Risk R01, (#state-zone-mapping)

**Artifacts:**
- `tugdeck/src/lib/status-area-config.ts`: `StatusRowItemId`, `ShelfLaneId`,
  `StatusAreaConfig`, `STATUS_AREA_DEFAULTS`, `STATUS_AREA_DOMAIN`/`KEY`,
  `parseStatusAreaConfig`, `writeStatusAreaConfig`, `useStatusAreaConfig`,
  `resolvePulseSurface`, plus the item-spec table (labels, `repeatable`,
  `flexible`) ported from the spike vocabulary.
- `tugdeck/src/lib/__tests__/status-area-config.test.ts`.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define types + defaults per Spec S01; port `RACK_ITEMS`/`LANE_LABELS`
      semantics from the spike as the production item-spec table.
- [ ] Implement `parseStatusAreaConfig` with full field-wise salvage (Risk R01).
- [ ] Implement `writeStatusAreaConfig` on the placement-experiment pattern
      (`setLocalValue` + PUT) and `useStatusAreaConfig` over `useTugbankValue`.
- [ ] Implement `resolvePulseSurface` per Spec S03.

**Tests:**
- [ ] Parse salvage: undefined entry, non-object value, unknown ids, duplicate
      one-shot items, repeated spacers kept, >3 lanes capped, missing fields.
- [ ] `resolvePulseSurface` truth table including the customizing-forces-shelf and
      disabled cases.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bun test status-area-config`
- [ ] `bunx tsc --noEmit`

---

#### Step 2: Row from registry {#step-2}

**Depends on:** #step-1

**Commit:** `Render Z2 status row from configured cell registry`

**References:** [P02] cell registry, [P09] focus orders, [P10] collapse rungs,
Spec S01, Spec S06, (#s01-config-schema, #s06-customize-bridge, #symbols)

**Artifacts:**
- `DevTelemetryStatusRow` rendering from `useStatusAreaConfig().row` over a cell
  registry; existing six cells' JSX moved verbatim into registry entries.
- New PULSE cell (pulse-store line, flexible width, dimmed-off when disabled) and
  SPACE / FLEX SPACE cells.
- `tug-status-cell.css`: `data-priority="pulse"` flexible-width rules; spacer cell
  rules.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build the registry (`StatusRowItemId` → cell render fn taking the row's
      already-computed snapshot/derived values) and map the config over it.
- [ ] Derive focus orders from configured order, skipping spacers ([P09]); keep
      `/context`'s `contextPopoverRef` attached iff a `context` cell renders.
- [ ] Add the PULSE cell reading the pulse-store snapshot (newest line + `enabled`);
      no popover ([Q01]).
- [ ] Add spacer cells (invisible at rest; glyph only while customizing — read from
      `StatusAreaCustomizeContext` (Spec S06), whose provider #step-3 mounts and
      #step-5 drives; the tolerant `null` default keeps gallery/fixture renders
      unchanged).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Focus-order derivation: default config → orders 0–5 over six cells; configs
      with spacers/pulse → spacers skipped, consecutive orders.
- [ ] Registry completeness: every `StatusRowItemId` resolves to an entry.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bun test` (tugdeck) + `bunx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] Live walk: with no stored config, the row is visually identical to before
      (cells, widths, popovers, Tab cycle); `window.tugDevPlacement` untouched.

---

#### Step 3: Status-area extraction + chrome {#step-3}

**Depends on:** #step-2

**Commit:** `Extract DevCardStatusArea; rearrange Z2 chrome; gate the strip`

**References:** [P03] status-area component, [P04] single-surface, [P09] chrome
conduct, Spec S02, Spec S03, Spec S06, (#s02-bar-chrome, #s06-customize-bridge)

**Artifacts:**
- `dev-card-status-area.tsx/.css`: bar (maximize left + spacer, CycleScope'd Z2
  content, gear, chevron), strip slot driven by `resolvePulseSurface`, shelf mount
  point (renders nothing until #step-4).
- `dev-card.tsx`: status-bar block replaced; `tide-pulse-strip` mount relocated
  into the area.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build the bar per Spec S02 (flank balance; gear `tinted` while customizing —
      state stubbed local until #step-5 wires the configurator; chevron toggles
      `shelfOpen` via `writeStatusAreaConfig`).
- [ ] Provide `StatusAreaCustomizeContext` from the area (constant
      `customizing: false` until #step-5) so the row's context consumption is
      exercised from the start (Spec S06).
- [ ] Compute `resolvePulseSurface` and render the strip only on `"strip"`;
      placeholder variant while customizing-and-suppressed ([P04]).
- [ ] Swap `dev-card.tsx`'s inline block for `<DevCardStatusArea …>`; `maximized`
      state + setter stay in `DevCardBody`.
- [ ] Preserve `:empty` collapse for a null Z2 slot and the cycle-scope wiring.

**Tests:**
- [ ] (covered by #step-1's resolver tests; no new pure-logic surface)

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bunx tsc --noEmit`; `bun test`
- [ ] Live walk: maximize works from the left end; cells stay centered; chevron
      flips and persists `shelfOpen` across reload (shelf itself still empty-mount);
      strip appears/disappears per the rule when toggling PULSE into the row config
      via console-written config.

---

#### Step 4: The shelf {#step-4}

**Depends on:** #step-3

**Commit:** `Add the Z2 status shelf: lanes, focus, footer`

**References:** [P05] shelf geometry, [P07] footer, [Q01], Spec S04,
(#s04-shelf-geometry)

**Artifacts:**
- `dev-card-status-shelf.tsx/.css`: lane band (TASKS / JOBS / PULSE rows from
  `useTaskListState` / `useJobsState` / pulse-store), legend focus affordance,
  fixed-height geometry, footer with clickable overflow counts.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build lanes per Spec S04 with production tokens; dot states reuse the
      task/job→`TugProgressIndicatorState` mappings; running-job elapsed uses the
      exported `useLiveTick` in a leaf component (popover precedent).
- [ ] Lane focus: legend button + chevrons-apart/together affordance, `data-focus`
      flex behavior, disabled under 2 lanes.
- [ ] Footer: per-lane overflow counts; TASKS/JOBS counts are `TugPopover` triggers
      reusing `TasksPopoverContent`/`JobsPopoverContent` (props threaded from the
      card: `onScrollToRow`, `onStopJob`, `onClearJobs`); PULSE count inert
      ([P07]/[Q01]); row always present while open.
- [ ] Mount in `DevCardStatusArea` on `shelfOpen ∥ customizing`; shelf lane for
      PULSE participates in the single-surface rule (already resolved in #step-3).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Pure-logic: lane overflow count math (rows beyond 5; zero floor).

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bunx tsc --noEmit`; `bun test`
- [ ] Live walk: shelf opens at fixed height; task/job/pulse data populate; height
      never moves as data changes; focus expand/contract; footer counts open the
      right popovers with working stop/clear; transcript cedes exactly the shelf's
      height.
- [ ] Live walk with **maximize on + shelf open together**: the transcript holds
      its floor (`--dev-transcript-min`) without collapsing and the entry's
      max-height cap holds — the two height-stealers coexist.

---

#### Step 5: The configurator {#step-5}

**Depends on:** #step-4

**Commit:** `Add in-place Z2 configurator with drag arrange`

**References:** [P06] drag grammar, [P08] configurator, [P01] live writes,
Spec S05, Spec S06, (#s05-drag-visuals, #s06-customize-bridge)

**Artifacts:**
- Customize mode in `DevCardStatusArea`: gear toggle, row palette + lane palette
  panels, config footer (hint / Restore Defaults / Done).
- Drag arrange on row + shelf: ghost, caret, source dim, grips, per-item `×`
  removal; `startDragGhost` / `computeInsertion` ported per Spec S05.
- Row cells show grips/`×`/spacer glyphs while customizing, driven through
  `StatusAreaCustomizeContext` (Spec S06; consumption landed in #step-2/#step-3).

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Wire `customizing` state: forces shelf open, pauses lane focus, switches lane
      legends to edit mode (grip + label + `×`).
- [ ] Implement the four drag flows (palette→row, row reorder, palette→shelf, lane
      reorder): payload on `dataTransfer`, delegated container handlers, imperative
      caret (Specs S05/S06); commit through `writeStatusAreaConfig` on drop;
      double-click append on palette chips.
- [ ] Palettes: fixed-height single-line strips directly beneath their sections;
      "all placed" text when empty; lane palette enforces the 3-lane cap.
- [ ] Config footer: hint text, Restore Defaults (writes `STATUS_AREA_DEFAULTS`),
      Done (exits mode); suppressed-strip placeholder behavior verified ([P04]).

**Tests:**
- [ ] `computeInsertion`: before-first, between-midpoints, append-after-last,
      empty container.
- [ ] Row-mutation helpers (insert with one-shot dedupe, remove, reorder
      with source-index adjustment) as pure functions.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bunx tsc --noEmit`; `bun test`
- [ ] Live walk in the app build: full customize round-trip — remove TIME, add
      PULSE to the row (strip stands down), reorder lanes, empty the shelf (band
      height holds, still a drop target), Restore Defaults, Done; hard reload
      preserves the arrangement; drag ghost/caret/dim all render in WKWebView.

---

#### Step 6: Docs {#step-6}

**Depends on:** #step-5

**Commit:** `Record configurable Z2 status area in design decisions`

**References:** [P01]–[P10], (#documentation-plan)

**Artifacts:**
- `tuglaws/design-decisions.md` entry; one-line shipped-pointer in the workshop
  card's docstring.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Write the [D##] entry: config object + domain, single-surface rule, shelf
      geometry, chrome order, footer conduct.
- [ ] Add the workshop-card docstring pointer.

**Tests:**
- [ ] (docs only)

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] `bunx tsc --noEmit` (docstring edit compiles); entry reads coherently against
      the shipped code.

---

#### Step 7: Integration checkpoint {#step-7}

**Depends on:** #step-2, #step-3, #step-4, #step-5

**Commit:** `N/A (verification only)`

**References:** [P04] single-surface, [P05] geometry, (#success-criteria)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Walk every success criterion end-to-end in the app build with a live session
      (real tasks, a background job, live PULSE from the pulse pipeline).
- [ ] Toggle `pulse/enabled` off and confirm all three PULSE homes go to their off
      states; back on restores.
- [ ] Narrow the card through the collapse rungs with a custom row; confirm
      acceptable degradation ([P10] watch-item).

**Tests:**
- [ ] Full `bun test` + `bunx tsc --noEmit` + `just app-test` sweep green.

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Every box in #success-criteria checked against the live walk.

---

### Deliverables and Checkpoints {#deliverables}

**Deliverable:** A user-configurable Z2 status area in the dev card — drag-arranged
instrument row, persisted pinned shelf with TASKS / JOBS / PULSE lanes, in-place
configurator, and PULSE surfacing exactly once — with the untouched-default
experience identical to today's row.

#### Phase Exit Criteria ("Done means…") {#exit-criteria}

- [ ] Default config renders the pre-plan row exactly (live walk).
- [ ] Row + lanes + shelf disposition persist via tugbank and survive reload.
- [ ] Open shelf is height-stable under all data conditions; footer counts open the
      existing popovers.
- [ ] PULSE single-surface rule holds across all configurations including
      customize mode and `pulse/enabled` off.
- [ ] All checkpoints green: `bun test`, `bunx tsc --noEmit`, `just app-test`.

**Acceptance tests:**
- [ ] `status-area-config` suite (parse salvage, resolver truth table, insertion
      math, mutation helpers).
- [ ] The #step-7 live walk of #success-criteria.

#### Roadmap / Follow-ons (Explicitly Not Required for Phase Close) {#roadmap}

- [ ] PULSE history popover from the strip / lane / footer count ([Q01]).
- [ ] Per-card scope filtering of PULSE surfaces ([Q02]).
- [ ] Shelf open/close height animation ([Q03]).
- [ ] Additional row datums (cost, TTFT) via the registry.
- [ ] Config-aware collapse rungs if narrow-card evidence demands ([P10]).

| Checkpoint | Verification |
|------------|--------------|
| Zero default drift | live walk vs. pre-plan row |
| Persistence | hard reload retains arrangement |
| Height stability | shelf + configurator never move with data |
| Single surface | PULSE in exactly one home in every state |
