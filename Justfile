# Signing: after xcodebuild's ad-hoc signing, the recipe re-signs via
# tugrust/scripts/sign-bundle.sh — inside-out, per [D16] of
# roadmap/tug-multi-instance.md. This gives the dev bundle a stable
# designated requirement (signed by Apple Developer ID) so the AX
# grant persists across rebuilds. Without it, every rebuild would
# invalidate the grant.
#
# (Note: Step 15 of the multi-instance plan will retire this recipe
# in favor of `just app-debug`. Until then, this is the canonical
# debug loop.)

# The debug/release axis (per [D17] of roadmap/tug-multi-instance.md,
# tokens renamed per [D19]): `app-debug` / `app-release` build +
# relaunch a per-(profile, branch) instance. Running `app-release`
# from a worktree branch produces a `(release, <branch>)` instance,
# not `(release, main)` — the axis is build-flavor, not
# identity-fork.
#
# Distribution-flow recipes (`dmg`, `notarize`) live separately and
# operate on bundles, not running instances.

# Build a Debug bundle and (re)launch the cwd-derived debug
# instance. Identity is computed from the current git branch and the
# `debug` profile.
#
# The quit-prior step is the FIRST thing the recipe does, before
# cargo/wasm/xcodebuild/sign. sign-bundle.sh rewrites the bundle's
# binaries in place; if the previous instance is still running, the
# kernel notices the signature change under its live mmap'd code and
# SIGKILLs tugcast — the WebView then flashes a disconnect banner
# during what should be a smooth handoff. Quitting first avoids that.

# Run app-tests by name: build-if-needed, then run the given files.
#
# NOT the everyday command — that's `just app-test-changed`, which
# derives its selection from your diff via each test's `@covers` header.
# Reach for `app-test` when you already know which files you want, and
# for the no-argument CORE tier (~20 tests, one per load-bearing
# surface) when you want a fast broad read on the app's health. The
# core tier is deliberately NOT everything: `just app-test-all` runs
# every file.
#
# Builds the dedicated app-test bundle (`dev.tugtool.app.apptest` →
# Tug-apptest.app) ONLY when it's missing, then launches each test file
# as its own Tug.app subprocess via `launchTugApp`. Output streams
# per-file; the last line is exactly `VERDICT: PASS` / `VERDICT: FAIL`
# (recipe exit code matches, greppable via `tail -n 1`).
#
# Fully isolated from your interactive instances AND from other
# worktrees: the bundle has its own identity, its own per-worktree
# DerivedData (so a build here never clobbers a live `app-debug`
# bundle or another worktree's app-test bundle), its own port window /
# sockets / private tmux server, and `apptest-<wtslug>-<uuid>`
# per-launch runtime state whose destructive sweeps match only this
# worktree's prefix. Whole invocations are serialized machine-wide by
# a port gate (`tugutil host gate --name apptest`) — native input and app
# activation are login-session singletons, so only one app-test run
# ever drives them at a time; a second invocation queues with a
# visible "held by <worktree>" message. AX is granted once via
# `just app-test-grant` and covers every worktree's bundle (the TCC
# grant keys on the path-independent designated requirement).
#
# Prereq (one-time per machine): `just setup-dev-signing`.
#
# Usage:
#   just app-test-changed                          # <- the everyday command
#   just app-test                                  # the ~20-test core tier
#   just app-test at0001-tab-switch-fc.test.ts     # one file (bare name or repo path)
#   just app-test harness-smoke/smoke.test.ts at0003-pane-activation.test.ts
#   just app-test-all                              # every test file
#
# Changed Swift / Rust / harness source? `app-test` only builds when the
# bundle is ABSENT — use `just app-test-build` to force a fresh build.
#
# Tests run in the BACKGROUND and leave your machine alone. They start
# immediately and never wait for you.
#
# The few whose subject is activation itself declare `@foreground` and really do
# take over the screen. When a run contains any of those, it raises the question
# in the Session card right away, runs every background test while you decide,
# and saves the screen-takers for last — so by the time the answer matters, it
# is usually already in. Declining skips them; the background run has already
# happened either way.
#
# The question is a chance to intervene, not a gate: it counts thirty seconds
# down and then runs them. Say no while it counts (Escape says it at once) and
# it skips them. Nobody there to say no means nobody there to disturb, and a
# run must not sit parked in a dialog because you stepped away.
#
# Set TUG_APPTEST_ASSUME to answer ahead of time and raise nothing:
#
#   TUG_APPTEST_ASSUME=all         run everything, screen-takers included
#   TUG_APPTEST_ASSUME=background  skip the screen-takers, keep working
#   TUG_APPTEST_ASSUME=cancel      run nothing at all
#
# Scripted and non-interactive runs should set it. With no Tug instance to ask,
# a run proceeds after naming the tests that will take the screen — blocking a
# terminal-only run that could never show a dialog is worse.
#
# Build the app-test bundle if missing, then run the given files (core tier if none).
