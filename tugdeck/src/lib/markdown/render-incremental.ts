/**
 * `render-incremental.ts` — incremental streaming-markdown reconciler.
 *
 * Replaces the rebuild-everything pattern in `tug-markdown-block.tsx`'s
 * streaming path with a per-block diff that mutates only what changed.
 * The driving requirement is preservation of *DOM element identity* for
 * blocks that did not change between renders: browser scroll anchoring
 * (`overflow-anchor: auto`) anchors on a specific element near the top
 * of the viewport, and any rebuild that destroys that element causes
 * the browser to pick a fresh anchor — visible as the transcript
 * snapping back to the top on every streaming delta. By keeping the
 * `.tugx-md-block` wrappers for the stable prefix unchanged across
 * renders, the anchor candidate persists and the scroll position holds.
 *
 * **Two layers, separately testable.**
 *
 *  1. `planReconcile` — pure logic. Given the previous render's
 *     per-block content hashes and the new render's hashes, returns a
 *     `ReconcilePlan` describing the four index ranges (stable,
 *     update-in-place, append, remove). No DOM. No state. Exhaustively
 *     unit-tested.
 *
 *  2. `renderIncremental` — DOM-mutating wrapper. Parses the new text,
 *     recovers the previous render's hashes from the container's own
 *     children (`data-content-hash`), calls `planReconcile`, then
 *     applies the plan in place. The DOM is the diff's sole source of
 *     truth: there is no carried-over state for a module reload or a
 *     strict-mode remount to desynchronize, so a wiped module-level
 *     cache can never cause a duplicate-append on top of children that
 *     are already on screen. HMR-vetted (no fake-DOM render tests per
 *     project policy).
 *
 * **Hash source.** Per-block FNV-1a 64-bit hashes computed in Rust
 * during the `lex_blocks` pass and surfaced on
 * `SanitizedMarkdownBlock.contentHash` (see [#step-18-8] commit 1/3).
 * Hashing the source byte range (not the rendered HTML) is correct
 * because `pulldown-cmark` is deterministic — same source range, same
 * parser options, same HTML output.
 *
 * **Cross-block features (footnotes, reference links).** A footnote
 * definition added later in the document changes the rendered HTML of
 * an earlier reference, but the reference's source byte range is
 * unchanged. Source-range hashing therefore classifies the earlier
 * block as stable and the reconciler skips it, leaving stale HTML in
 * place until the user interacts. Acceptable trade-off for the
 * streaming-markdown case (footnotes are rare in tool-generated
 * output); a future enhancement could hash the rendered HTML for
 * stronger correctness at a small Rust-side cost.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L02] no React state; the reconciler is invoked from the same
 *    `useLayoutEffect` that owns the streaming subscription.
 *  - [L06] DOM mutations only; no React rerender per delta.
 *  - [L19] file pair (this `.ts` + a sibling test file), module
 *    docstring, exported types.
 *  - [L22] streaming subscription writes DOM imperatively via this
 *    helper; React's render cycle is bypassed for per-delta updates.
 *  - [L23] preserves user-visible scroll position by preserving the
 *    DOM element identity that browser scroll anchoring depends on.
