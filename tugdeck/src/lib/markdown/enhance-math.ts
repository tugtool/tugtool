/**
 * `enhance-math.ts` — post-`innerHTML` math typesetter for markdown
 * blocks. Companion of {@link enhanceFencedCode}; called from
 * {@link renderIncremental} immediately after a block element's
 * content has been written.
 *
 * **Two passes per block.**
 *
 *  1. {@link walkInlineMath} promotes `$...$` and `$$...$$` text
 *     ranges into pending `.tugx-katex` placeholder spans. The
 *     transformer-emitted display placeholders (` ```math ` fences
 *     promoted to `<div class="tugx-katex">`) are already in the DOM.
 *
 *  2. {@link enhanceMath} walks every pending placeholder, reads the
 *     LaTeX source out of `el.textContent`, and asks the lazy KaTeX
 *     engine to render into the element. If KaTeX hasn't loaded yet,
 *     the first call kicks off the load; subsequent calls (within
 *     the same paint frame for streaming) share the same promise.
 *
 * **Failure mode** (per [R04]). Any KaTeX parse error keeps the
 * placeholder element on the page with its raw LaTeX source visible
 * (the fallback content the transformer / walker already put there)
 * and stamps `data-tugx-math-error="true"` for CSS styling. The
 * parent block is not torn down — the error is contained to the
 * offending placeholder. A toast surface is left to the caller via
 * the optional `onError` callback so the markdown primitive doesn't
 * have to know about toast plumbing.
 *
 * **Idempotency.** Each placeholder carries
 * `data-tugx-math-pending="true"` until rendered; after a successful
 * render the attribute is removed and `data-tugx-math-rendered="true"`
 * is set, so a re-enhance pass on the same DOM (e.g. after an
 * unrelated incremental update) is a no-op for already-typeset
 * placeholders. Streaming updates rewrite the parent's `innerHTML`,
 * which removes every placeholder; the next enhance pass starts
 * fresh.
 *
