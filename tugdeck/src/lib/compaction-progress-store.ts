/**
 * `compactionProgressStore` — drives the `/compact` progress sheet.
 *
 * Native `/compact` dispatches as a stream-json user message and compacts in
 * place (same session, same JSONL). It is an opaque run — minutes on a full
 * context — with no streamed volume to meter, so the sheet is pane-modal and
 * **indeterminate**: the run is either in flight or settled. This singleton is
 * the seam between the session-card handler that opens the run (`begin`) and
 * drives it off `codeSessionStore` snapshots (`succeed` / `cancel` / `fail`),
 * and the sheet that renders off the same store. The card watches the terminal
 * `outcome` to raise the closing bulletin and `clear`.
 *
 * Every mutator is keyed by `cardId`, and the snapshot is a map of the runs
 * currently open. Each card owns its own `codeSessionStore`, so any number of
 * cards can be compacting at once; a per-card key is what keeps a second
 * `/compact` from overwriting the first's run, and keeps one card's `clear`
 * from dropping another card's sheet.
 *
 * The run's lifetime is this store's, NOT the sheet's: the card's watcher is
 * subscribed here, so a sheet dismissed early (Escape, a host unmount) leaves
 * the compaction running and still settling into the transcript.
 *
 * No entry for a card = idle (no compaction, no sheet). An entry with
 * `outcome === null` is a run in flight; an entry with a terminal `outcome` is
 * a just-settled run awaiting that card's bulletin + `clear`.
 *
 * Both manual `/compact` and native auto-compaction stream a `compact_boundary`,
 * but only a manual `/compact` opens this run — the progress sheet and closing
 * bulletin are scoped to the explicit command.
 *
 * Module-level singleton, matching the other per-session helper stores
 * ([L02] external state reaches React through `useSyncExternalStore`).
