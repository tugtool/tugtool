/**
 * file-kinds.ts — which card a path opens into, decided by extension.
 *
 * The deck edits text and *views* everything else. This module is the one
 * place that draws that line: `classifyFileKind` maps a path to the kind of
 * card it belongs in, and every open flows through it via
 * `openFileInCard`.
 *
 * The table is a closed allowlist, never a conformance test. Camera RAW
 * conforms to `public.image` but WebKit's `<img>` cannot reliably decode it,
 * so a type appears here only when the deck can actually render it. Anything
 * unlisted classifies as `"text"` and takes the Text card path unchanged.
 *
 * The same extension list lives in tugcast's `fs_blob.rs` MIME table and in
 * `AppDelegate.viewableContentTypes`; all three move together when a type is
 * added.
