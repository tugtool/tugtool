/**
 * Public types for `TugDevLogStore` — the in-app logging surface that
 * backs the `Log` inspector tab on `TugDevPanel`.
 *
 * The store is append-only from the app's perspective: anywhere in
 * tugdeck can call `tugDevLogStore.{debug,info,warn,error}(...)` to
 * record an event. The inspector renders the buffered entries with
 * filter / clear / copy affordances.
 *
 * Conformance:
 *   - [L02] external store; React reads via `useSyncExternalStore`.
 *   - Filter state + cap persist via tugbank under
 *     `dev.tugtool.dev-panel/{logFilterLevels,logFilterSource,logMaxEntries}`.
 *     Free-text filter is in-memory only (not persisted) — see
 *     `TugDevLogFilters.text` below.
