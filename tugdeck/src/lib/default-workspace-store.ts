/**
 * default-workspace-store.ts — the frontend's cache of browse holds on
 * directories that no session card has opened.
 *
 * Open Quickly searches through the FILETREE feed, which routes a query by
 * its `root` to a registered workspace on the tugcast side. A bound session
 * card already has one. With no bound card — an empty deck, or the in-bar
 * directory switcher pointed at a recent project — nothing has registered the
 * directory, so this store asks tugcast for a browse hold
 * (`POST /api/workspace/acquire`) and caches the `{workspaceKey, projectDir}`
 * it answers with.
 *
 * Holds are kept for the app's lifetime rather than per popup-open. Releasing
 * at zero refcount tears the workspace entry down, so an acquire/release pair
 * around each ⇧⌘O would re-walk the directory on every invocation. The
 * bootstrap `--source-tree` workspace already lives process-long; these are
 * the same shape. The one release that does happen is when the default
 * project directory setting changes: the old hold is dropped so its watcher
 * goes away, and the next open acquires the new path.
 *
 * Acquisition is asynchronous and the popup renders immediately, so a caller
 * reads `null` until the round trip lands and re-renders on the store's
 * notification ([L02] via `useSyncExternalStore`).
 *
