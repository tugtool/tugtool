/**
 * Path resolution — does this path reference point at a file that exists?
 *
 * A path only becomes actionable once the answer is yes, because a link
 * that dead-ends is worse than plain text. The answer comes from the
 * filesystem, which means it is asynchronous, which means the annotator's
 * synchronous DOM pass cannot wait for it. This module is how those two
 * clocks are reconciled.
 *
 * **Why a store and not a fetch per call.** Streaming re-runs the pass on
 * every delta, and a pass over a long transcript sees the same paths over
 * and over. A probe per pass would issue the same question dozens of
 * times per second. Instead `lookup` is synchronous and answers from
 * cache: a path it has never seen is recorded as wanted and returns
 * `pending`, a short debounce later the accumulated wants go out as one
 * deduped batch, and the verdicts land in a cache that every subsequent
 * pass reads for free. Steady state does no network work at all.
 *
 * Verdict arrival bumps a version and notifies listeners, which is what
 * drives the re-annotation pass that turns a newly-confirmed path into a
 * link over already-rendered ink. Only a real answer notifies: a lost one
 * changes nothing painted, so it stays silent.
 *
 * **Honesty under failure.** A transport error records candidates as
 * `unknown`, never `confirmed` and never `missing`: an unreachable server
 * means we don't know. Recorded, not forgotten — a forgotten verdict is
 * re-asked by the very re-annotation its forgetting triggers, and that loop
 * never converges. The one thing this must never do is manufacture a link.
 *
 * **A "no" expires; a "yes" does not.** `missing` and `unknown` are answers
 * about a moment, and the moment passes: a Gazette post narrates a plan file
 * minutes before it is written, a probe is lost while the server restarts.
 * Cached for the app's life, either one leaves a reference permanently dead
 * on a surface that is still open, and no amount of scrolling back can
 * revive it. So a non-affirmative verdict carries the time it was asked at,
 * and a lookup past {@link RETRY_AFTER_MS} asks again. It keeps serving the
 * old answer meanwhile — the re-ask is invisible unless it changes
 * something, and {@link PathResolutionStore.applyProbeResult} notifies only
 * on change, so a still-missing path costs one silent probe a minute and a
 * newly-arrived one lights up on the next pass. `confirmed` never expires:
 * re-asking it could only ever take a live link away, and the open gesture
 * finds out for real anyway.
 *
 * The endpoint rejects relative paths outright, so a relative candidate is
 * joined against the session cwd first. Until the cwd arrives — it is null
 * until the session handshake lands — a relative candidate is parked
 * rather than probed, and the pass that follows the cwd's arrival asks
 * again.
