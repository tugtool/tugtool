/**
 * Wrapping a run of text in place — how an entity found *inside* a longer
 * string becomes its own element.
 *
 * Whole-element annotation is the easy case: an inline `<code>` span that
 * is entirely one path gets the marks stamped on the span it already has.
 * But the shapes that matter most in real ink are not their own element —
 * a filename in the middle of a sentence, a path buried in a command line
 * — and marking those means splitting the text node they live in and
 * giving the run an element of its own.
 *
 * Wrappers are marked `data-tugx-wrapped` so a later pass can tell the
 * elements this pass created from the ones the renderer did. That
 * matters because a verdict can change: a wrapper whose entity no longer
 * resolves is unwrapped and its text folded back into its neighbours, so
 * the DOM stays a function of what is currently known rather than an
 * accumulation of everything ever believed.

 *
 *  - `<a>` — already a link; a path inside its label is not a second one.
 *  - `<pre>` — fenced code is content being shown, not references being
 *    made. (Inline `<code>` is *not* skipped: that is where paths live.)
 *  - anything already annotated — including this pass's own wrappers, so
 *    re-running never nests a wrapper inside a wrapper.
 *
 * Every collected node is scanned the same way. Whether the text sits
 * inside a `<code>` span decides how it is *painted*, never whether it is
 * *read*: the resolver is the gate, so detection has nothing to gain from
 * knowing which markup a candidate arrived in.
