/**
 * The DOM face of an annotation: stamping one onto an element, and
 * reading one back off the element a gesture landed on.
 *
 * Everything an interaction layer needs to know about an annotated
 * element is in its class and dataset, which is what lets a delegated
 * listener on the transcript root service ink it never rendered — prose
 * the annotator marked, a tool header a component stamped, a chip host
 * grafted in after the fact. They are indistinguishable here by design.
 *
 * The decision logic these functions carry out lives in `payloads.ts` and
 * is pure; this module is the thin DOM shell over it.
