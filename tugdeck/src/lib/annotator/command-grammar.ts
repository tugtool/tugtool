/**
 * Command-line grammars — the pure matchers that decide whether a piece
 * of transcript ink is a command a gesture can act on.
 *
 * Two command families are recognized:
 *
 *  - **Slash commands** — `/tugplug:implement roadmap/x.md`. The grammar
 *    is necessary but not sufficient: the caller's known-command
 *    predicate is the authoritative gate. Matching the grammar first
 *    rejects the overwhelming majority of candidates cheaply, and splits
 *    `name` from `args`.
 *  - **Shell commands** — a line beginning with a known project CLI tool
 *    followed by a subcommand. There is no runtime catalog to gate
 *    against; the leading tool name is the whole gate.
 *
 * Pure — no DOM, no store — so the annotator's DOM pass and its tests
 * share exactly one definition of what a command line is.
