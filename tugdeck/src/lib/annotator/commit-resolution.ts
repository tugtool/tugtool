/**
 * Commit resolution — is this run of hex a commit in this repository?
 *
 * The repository is the only thing that can answer, and its answer doubles
 * as the payload: `GIT_COMMIT_FILES_QUERY` returns the files a commit
 * touched, which is both the existence check (a sha git cannot show comes
 * back with no files) and the `paths` a diff descriptor wants. So one
 * question serves verification and the gesture together.
 *
 * The shape mirrors the other resolvers: `lookup` is synchronous and
 * answers from cache, an unseen sha is queued and reported `pending`, and
 * the answer notifies so the waiting ink re-marks. Commits are immutable,
 * so a verdict is cached for the app's life and a repeat pass costs
 * nothing.
 *
 * Queries drain one at a time. The response feed is shared and single-slot
 * — every client sees every answer — so correlation is by `requestId`, and
 * a frame that answers someone else's question is ignored rather than
 * mistaken for ours. An unanswered question is retried a bounded number of
 * times (silently, verdict still `pending`) and then recorded as a
 * terminal `unknown`, never `missing`: an unreachable tugcast means we
 * don't know. Terminal, because a forgotten verdict is re-asked by the
 * very re-annotation its forgetting triggers, and that loop never
 * converges.
 *
