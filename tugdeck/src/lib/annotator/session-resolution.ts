/**
 * Does this candidate name a real session? — the annotator's adapter over
 * `session-citation-store`.
 *
 * The path scan has `pathResolutionStore`; the commit scan has the commit
 * resolver; this is the session scan's, and it keeps their contract exactly:
 * synchronous, cached, and an answer that arrives later re-runs the pass.
 *
 * **Resolution is not the spelling.** The ledger accepts a full uuid, a unique
 * 8-char prefix, or a **bare callsign** matched against `sessions.tag` — and
 * nothing else. `project/callsign` is not a query key in any arm; sent whole it
 * falls through every one and comes back unknown. So a detected pair is split
 * and the **callsign half** is what goes to the store.
 *
 * **The project half is evidence, not decoration.** It is checked against the
 * answer's own `projectDir` (by basename), and a callsign that resolves under a
 * different project is refuted rather than confirmed. That check is the whole
 * reason the pair shape beats the bare callsign the detector rejects: without
 * it the project prefix would add characters and nothing else.

 *    the FULL session id, which is what a citation chip needs regardless of

 *  - `refuted` — no such session, or it belongs to another project. The run
