/**
 * The annotation kind registry — what each entity kind *does*.
 *
 * This is the library's central promise: the transcript owns one
 * delegated click listener and one context-menu provider, and both ask
 * the registry what to do with whatever annotation the gesture landed on.
 * Adding an entity kind is therefore a detector plus an entry here, with
 * no edit to any transcript, cell, or menu surface.
 *
 * Three things a kind declares:
 *
 *  - `primaryClick` — what a plain click does, or nothing at all. URLs
 *    and email addresses deliberately have none: they are real anchors,
 *    and native navigation (routed to the system browser by the host's
 *    navigation delegate) is already the correct behavior. Intercepting
 *    it in JS would be regression risk for no gain.
 *  - `menuEntries` + `suppressStandardItems` — what a right-click offers,
 *    and whether those items *replace* the standard text-menu block or
 *    sit below it. Commands replace it: a selection-scoped Copy beside
 *    Copy-the-command would copy whatever sub-word the browser
 *    smart-selected, which is never what the user meant. Kinds whose
 *    entries don't collide with Copy append instead, so right-clicking an
 *    annotation inside a selection keeps Copy and Select All.
 *  - `wholeEntitySelection` — whether a secondary click may leave a
 *    sub-word highlighted inside the annotation. Commands say no: the
 *    browser's smart-select would paint a word the menu has no item for.
 *
 * @see module:components/tugways/use-text-surface-context-menu for where
 * the last of those is honored.
 *
 * @module lib/annotator/registry
