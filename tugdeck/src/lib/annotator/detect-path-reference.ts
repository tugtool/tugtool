/**
 * The file-path grammar — what *might* be a path reference in transcript
 * ink, before anything checks whether it exists.
 *
 * This grammar is deliberately permissive, because it is not the safety
 * mechanism. Resolution is: a candidate becomes an annotation only once
 * the filesystem (or the project's file index) confirms a real file, so a
 * candidate that is merely prose costs one cached lookup and stays plain
 * text. A grammar strict enough to also serve as a false-positive filter
 * would be doing a job that is already done, and would pay for it by
 * throwing away the shapes Claude actually writes — a bare
 * `tug-button.css` in a sentence, or a path sitting inside a longer
 * command line.
 *
 * So the rules here only ask whether a token *could* name a file:
 *
 *  - It has no whitespace. A path is one token; this is what lets a path
 *    be found inside a sentence at all.
 *  - It carries no `scheme://` — that is a URL, and a different kind.
 *  - It does not begin with `~`. Resolving home-relative forms would need
 *    a client-side home-derivation rule nothing else needs yet.
 *  - It either carries a `/` (resolved against the session cwd), or it is
 *    a bare `name.ext` (resolved through the project's file index, the
 *    same search Open Quickly runs). A bare name's extension must contain
 *    a letter, which costs nothing and keeps version numbers and decimals
 *    out of the index.
 *
 * A trailing `:N` or `:N:C` is a line (and column) citation — the shape a
 * compiler, a grep, and Claude all write. The column is parsed and
 * discarded, since opening a file addresses lines.
 *
 * Pure and total: callers decide what to do with a candidate, and whether
 * it resolves to a real file is a separate question the resolvers answer.
