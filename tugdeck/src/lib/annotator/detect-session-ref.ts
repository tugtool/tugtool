/**
 * The session-reference grammar — what might name a session in ink.
 *
 * Two spellings, and only two:
 *
 *  - A **full session uuid** (`8-4-4-4-12`, lowercase hex). Collision-free by
 *    construction — nothing else in prose looks like one — so it needs no
 *    other evidence to be worth asking about.
 *  - A **`project/callsign` pair**, where the callsign half is a session's
 *    mnemonic: two lowercase words, plus the fork lineage suffix when there
 *    is one (`tugtool/quirky-hull`, `tugtool/stocky-pixie-A1`,
 *    `tugtool/stocky-pixie-A1-B2`). The lineage segments are the ledger's own
 *    sanctioned suffix — `<Letter><Number>`, allocated per fork point — and
 *    the grammar takes them because `sessions.tag` holds the COMPOSED
 *    callsign; without them a forked session would be undetectable by
 *    construction.
 *
 * A **bare callsign** is deliberately not scanned. `kind-floor` is shaped like
 * every hyphenated compound in English, and scanning it would cost a resolver
 * round trip per false positive while painting chips over ordinary words. The
 * project half is what makes the pair worth its characters: it is evidence,
 * checked against the answer's own `projectDir` before the candidate counts
 * (see `session-resolution.ts`).
 *
 * Like every other detector here, this is not the filter — the ledger is. A
 * candidate that names no session resolves to nothing and stays plain text.
