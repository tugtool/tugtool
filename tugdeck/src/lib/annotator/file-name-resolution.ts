/**
 * Filename resolution — which file does a bare `tug-button.css` mean?
 *
 * `fs/stat` can answer a path, because a path says where to look. A bare
 * filename says only what to look for, and it is the shape transcript
 * prose uses most: Claude writes the name of the file it just edited, not
 * a route to it. Answering that needs a search over the project, which is
 * exactly what Open Quickly already does — this module asks the same
 * question of the same index (FILETREE), so a name resolves here if and
 * only if typing it into Open Quickly and pressing Return would open it.
 *
 * **The match rule.** A result counts when the written text is the whole
 * tail of an indexed path — `tug-button.css` matches
 * `tugdeck/styles/tug-button.css` but not `old-tug-button.css`, and a
 * written `styles/tug-button.css` matches only a path ending in that whole
 * run. Among several such matches the best-scoring one wins, which is the
 * row Open Quickly would have put first. Fuzzy near-misses are discarded:
 * the index's scorer is built to rank candidates for a human who is about
 * to choose, and nobody is choosing here.
 *
 * **Why a queue.** The FILETREE feed is single-slot — one query
 * outstanding, and each response replaces the last snapshot — so a pass
 * that meets forty filenames cannot ask forty questions at once. Wants go
 * into a FIFO and drain one at a time. That is slow in the way a
 * background index is allowed to be slow: nothing blocks on it, verdicts
 * cache for the app's life, and a name already answered costs nothing on
 * every later pass.
 *
 * **Honesty under failure.** The feed is shared with Open Quickly, so a
 * query the user fires mid-flight can land on top of ours. An answer that
 * does not match the question is ignored. A question that goes unanswered
 * past a deadline is retried a bounded number of times — silently, from
 * inside the queue, with the verdict still `pending` — and then recorded
 * as `unknown`, never `missing`. Recorded matters: an unanswered question
 * must not forget its verdict, because a forgotten verdict is re-asked by
 * the very re-annotation its forgetting triggers, and that loop never
 * converges. The one thing this must never do is manufacture a link.
 *
 * **A "no" expires.** A name the index does not carry today may be a file
 * tomorrow — narration routinely names a file just before it is written —
 * so `missing` and `unknown` age out after {@link RETRY_AFTER_MS} and are
 * asked again, on the same terms as a path's ({@link
 * lib/annotator/path-resolution}). The old answer keeps being served
 * meanwhile, and only a changed one notifies, so an unresolvable name costs
 * one queued query a minute rather than a permanently dead reference.
 *
