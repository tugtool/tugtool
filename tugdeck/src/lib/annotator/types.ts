/**
 * Shared vocabulary for the content annotator.
 *
 * An **annotation** is an actionable entity in transcript ink: a URL, an
 * email address, a command line, a file path. Every annotation has a
 * *kind* (what it is) and a *payload* (the structured value a gesture
 * acts on). The kind and payload travel on the DOM element as dataset
 * attributes, which is what lets one delegated listener on the transcript
 * root service every entity without knowing which surface produced it.
 *
 * The model is deliberately open: adding an entity type means adding a
 * kind, its payload shape, and a detector — not a new mechanism.
 *
