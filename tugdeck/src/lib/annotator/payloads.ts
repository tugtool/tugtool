/**
 * Annotation payloads and their dataset round-trip.
 *
 * An annotation's *payload* is the structured value a gesture acts on —
 * the URL to open, the command name and arguments to seed. It has to
 * survive a trip through the DOM, because detection happens when a block
 * renders and action happens when the user clicks, possibly much later,
 * on an element the listener finds by `closest()` rather than by
 * identity. Dataset attributes are that carrier.
 *
 * These functions are the whole of that translation, and they are pure —
 * they take and return plain string records, never elements. The DOM pass
 * and the delegated listeners are thin shells over them, which is what
 * lets the contract be pinned by unit test in a project that runs no
 * fake-DOM tests.
