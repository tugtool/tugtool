/**
 * transport-state-store — the app-wide health of the WebSocket transport to
 * tugcast, as a {@link useSyncExternalStore}-compatible store ([L02]).
 *
 * Unlike `CodeSessionStore.transportState` (which is *per-card* and folds in a
 * "restoring" binding-ack phase), this is a single app-level reading of the
 * socket itself — `online` once a handshake completes, `offline` when the wire
 * drops, `reconnecting` while a backoff retry is scheduled. It is the channel
 * TugSetup reads to show a calm "Reconnecting…" body instead of a dead wizard
 * when the transport falls over mid-setup (#tugsetup-states).
 *
 * The store is *driven* from `main.tsx`, which already owns the
 * `ConnectionLifecycle` singleton and wires its other observers there — so this
 * module stays free of any import-order dependency on the lifecycle being
 * registered. It starts `online` (optimistic): the not-yet-connected case is
 * covered by TugSetup's probing body, and a real drop flips it `offline` /
 * `reconnecting`.
 *
