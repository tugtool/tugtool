/**
 * ai-config.ts — pure helpers for the composite AI configuration surface: the
 * `AI` chip, the mixer sheet, and the host menu's `AI: …` title.
 *
 * No React, no DOM, no I/O. Model, reasoning effort, and permission mode are
 * three settings the user thinks of as one — "how the AI runs" — and this
 * module holds the three pieces of logic that thought needs and that the
 * per-setting modules ([model-label.ts], [effort.ts], [permission-mode.ts])
 * cannot own alone:
 *
 *  - {@link formatAiConfigSummary} — the ONE composite string. The chip value
 *    line, the sheet's caption, and the menu item's title all render this
 *    function's output, so the three surfaces cannot word it differently.
 *  - {@link computeAiConfigCommit} — the sheet is a transaction: nothing goes
 *    on the wire until OK, and OK sends the minimal ORDERED sequence of
 *    actions. The ordering is load-bearing (a model change must be recorded
 *    before the respawn an effort change triggers), which is why the result is
 *    an array and not a record — as an array the ordering is a property of a
 *    pure function rather than of whatever executes it.
 *  - {@link clampEffortToSupport} — effort is model-gated, so picking a model
 *    in the sheet can strand the pending effort on a level that model does not
 *    offer.
 *  - {@link resolveAiConfigSources} — the ONE reading of a metadata snapshot
 *    into "which options, and what is currently set". Every surface that edits
 *    these three settings resolves them here, so none of them can resolve them
 *    slightly differently.
 *
 * Plus the sticky-row constants: the sheet remembers which row the user last
 * changed and opens focused there.
 *
