/**
 * AppInfoStore — app identity delivered by the native host.
 *
 * The Swift app menu's About item sends a `show-card` control frame
 * whose payload carries the app's build identity (version, build,
 * commit, branch, profile, copyright) read from `BuildInfo` /
 * Info.plist on the native side. The `show-card` action handler parks
 * that payload here; the About card reads it via
 * `useSyncExternalStore` [L02].
 *
 * In-memory only — identity is constant for a process lifetime and is
 * re-delivered on every About invocation, so nothing persists. When no
 * payload has arrived yet (browser-only dev with no Swift host), the
 * snapshot is `null` and the About card renders placeholders.
 *
