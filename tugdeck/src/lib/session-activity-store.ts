/**
 * `SessionActivityStore` — the app-scoped, per-session activity model
 * ([P01], Spec S01). One store keyed by `tug_session_id` (mirroring
 * `PulseStore`), holding a per-channel {@link ActivityMeterLike} for each
 * session, fed by one `ACTIVITY` subscription ([P13] wire contract).
 *
 * The store is a **pure consumer** ([P01]–[P04]): the wire frame maps 1:1
 * to `record(session, channel, units, at)`. All derivation lives upstream
 * in tugcode ([Q05]); the deck no longer counts anything off CODE_OUTPUT.
 *
 * **State zones.** The high-churn series live only in the meters, read
 * imperatively by consumers woken from this store's activity events and
 * painted outside React ([L02], [L06], [P03]). Only membership (which
 * sessions/channels exist) and `enabled` pass through the
 * `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot — a new session or a session's first
 * sample on a new channel ticks React; individual samples never do.
 *
 * **The clock.** `record()` is the only clock in the activity system:
 * consumers never poll. A sample that passes the ingestion change gate is
 * pushed synchronously to `subscribeActivity` listeners; a sample that
 * doesn't (zero rate units, sub-epsilon gauge jitter) updates its meter
 * and wakes nothing. An idle session therefore costs its consumers
 * nothing — no timers, no animations — by construction.
