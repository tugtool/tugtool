/**
 * slash-supported.ts — the [D14] slash-command allowlist: a three-tier
 * classifier over command names.
 *
 * In stream-json / print mode claude has no interactive UI, so a command's
 * fate in the dev card is one of three things ([D14] refinement,
 * #slash-cmd-audit):
 *
 * - **`supported-local`** — a [D23] local command with a Tug surface
 *   (`lib/slash-commands.ts` registry). Typed, it dispatches to its surface;
 *   it is offered in the popup.
 * - **`pass-through`** — a name that is neither local nor hidden. By name
 *   alone this is the default, so a new/unknown command is never *silently*
 *   swallowed. At submit, the dev card refines it against claude's reported
 *   command catalog (see {@link isUnknownRemoteCommand}): a pass-through name
 *   claude actually reports (`/init`, `/insights`, `/recap`, a skill or
 *   agent command) is **sent to claude verbatim** and runs a real turn; a
 *   pass-through name claude does *not* report is a genuine unknown (a typo)
 *   and is reported to the user client-side instead of burning a turn.
 *   Pass-throughs are offered in the popup.
 * - **`hidden`** — a known command with no useful behavior over the bridge
 *   (terminal-only UI flags, account/host surfaces, device/teleport,
 *   automation/plugin config deferred to a future plan, MCP). Absent from the
 *   popup, and **swallowed at submit** (silent drop, never sent to claude).
 *   The canonical user-facing list of these lives in
 *   `tuglaws/dev-card-unsupported-slash-commands.md`, kept in sync with
 *   {@link HIDDEN_SLASH_COMMANDS} below.
 *
 * Two consumers read this module: the dev-card completion layer filters
 * claude's reported commands through it (drop the `hidden` tier — see
 * `filterCommandProvider` in `completion-providers/local-commands.ts`), and
 * the prompt entry's submit path swallows a typed `hidden` command before it
 * reaches claude. Both are dev-card / bridge policy, so the filter is applied
 * at the dev-card composition layer rather than inside the generic
 * `SessionMetadataStore` — same reasoning that keeps the local-command merge
 * out of the store ([#step-1c]).
 *
 * Pure data + pure lookup — no React, no DOM, no store dependency.
 *
 * @module lib/slash-supported
