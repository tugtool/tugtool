 * hands the user a chip to click. Choosing the model is the user's act, before
 * they click — nothing here changes it in either direction.
 *
 * What survives is the part that was always honest work: resolving a bare
 * `/plan-review` to a plan, and remembering the last one so the next bare
 * invocation has an answer.

 *
 * The dash branch joins `plan_path` onto the dash's worktree, which arrives
 * absolute, and so lands on the **worktree** copy — the one a run edits and
 * whose ledger the step verbs rewrite, which is the copy the run's own stale
 * gate reads. `projectDir` does not enter into it: a card's project directory
 * may itself be a linked worktree, and the dash path is resolved against the
 * main repository root, which only the server knows.
 *
 * Pure: the card has no filesystem, so nothing here stats, normalizes, or
 * round-trips. A path that does not exist is the review turn's report to make.
