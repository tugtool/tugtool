/**
 * Unit tests for the legacy fake-compaction replay recognition helpers ([P06]).

 * compacts in place); these tests pin that OLD JSONLs carrying the markers
 * still reconstruct — the seed block splits back to its summary and the
 * canceled-summarize marker is recognized. Seed / summarize strings are inlined
 * literals (the builders are deleted), matching the exact bytes legacy JSONLs
 * hold.
