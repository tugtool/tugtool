/**
 * layout-imposer-solutions.test.ts — the space allocator's whole solution
 * space, enumerated.
 *
 * The allocator is a total function of (canvas width, imposition kind,
 * occupied slots and their widths, rail policies), and for any fixed discrete
 * configuration its answer is piecewise-linear in canvas width with a handful
 * of computable breakpoints. That is small enough to *check exhaustively*
 * rather than to spot-check, so this file does two things:
 *
 *  1. **The invariant sweep** — the strong net. Every configuration below is
 *     solved at every breakpoint (±1px, where the answer's slope changes) and
 *     across a coarse canvas sweep, and every point is asserted against the
 *     invariant order the solver implements: totality, bounds, greed
 *     soundness, tiling, monotonicity in canvas width, and tie fairness. These
 *     are PROPERTIES, so they survive an intentional retune of the numbers.
 *  2. **The golden table** — the drift net. A deterministic representative
 *     slice is serialized and compared against a checked-in JSON file, so ANY
 *     behavioral change, intended or not, shows up in review as a readable
 *     diff.
 *
 * Regenerate the golden deliberately:
 *
 * ```
 * cd tugdeck && IMPOSER_GOLDEN_UPDATE=1 bun test src/lib/__tests__/layout-imposer-solutions.test.ts

  // A seam is usually non-increasing in the rails' total (a bigger total is a

  // 675 card in slot 1 and a 1230 card in slot 2 at canvas 1300, a 400px rail
  // occludes by 780 and a 675px rail by 675, because shrinking the band drains
  // the near card's travel to zero faster than it moves the far card in.
