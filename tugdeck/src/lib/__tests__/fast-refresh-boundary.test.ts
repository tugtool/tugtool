/**
 * Drift guard for Fast Refresh boundary hygiene.
 *
 * Pure-logic test over the static reachability analyzer in
 * `scripts/fast-refresh-sweep.ts` (the oracle — happy-dom is deleted, so a
 * runtime HMR test is impossible; this is the falsifiable substitute). It
 * freezes the set of files that have been made clean refresh boundaries: if
 * any of them regains a runtime non-component export (re-mixing the
 * boundary), `escapesPath` flips to `true` and this test fails — catching the
 * regression before it ships a full-page-reload back into the transcript spine.
 *
 * The frozen list grows as boundary work lands. It starts with only the
 * analyzer's own wiring asserted; spine files are added when they are cleaned.
