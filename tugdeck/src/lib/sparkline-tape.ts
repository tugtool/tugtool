/**
 * sparkline-tape — the tape's policy, with no DOM in it.
 *
 * `TugSparkline` is two things wearing one coat: a policy (when to sample,
 * when to stop, when the epoch rebases, when the tape may go inert) and a
 * surface (a canvas, a WAAPI transform, an `IntersectionObserver`, computed
 * style). This module is the policy half. It owns the tape array, the clock
 * it stamps points with, the deadband that decides what counts as change,
 * the two finishers, dormancy, and the epoch. It reaches the world only
 * through {@link SparklineSurface}, and it reads the clock and the timers
 * only through {@link SparklineTapeOptions} — so a test can drive it with a
 * fake clock and record every call it makes.
 *
 * The rules the tape obeys are the component's rules, unchanged:
 *
 *  1. Values are NEVER revised. A point, once shown, is permanent; the pen
 *     holds the newest value flat to the right edge.
 *  2. New samples write at the right edge and scroll left at a constant rate.
 *  3. THE DATA EVENT IS THE ONLY CLOCK. Every append is downstream of an
 *     `onActivity` call. The only timers are finishers for work an event
 *     started, and each terminates by construction.
 *  4. DORMANCY IS THE NO-EVENT STATE. Once every change has scrolled off,
 *     the tape is inert until the next event.
 *
 * ## Three clocks, and where each one stops
 *
 * | Clock | Owns |
 * |---|---|
 * | `performance.now()` (monotonic) | the tape's own axis: `SparklinePoint.t`, `committedT0`, `lastChangeAt`, `lastEventAt`, the deadband and settle timers |
 * | `document.timeline` (same origin) | the scroll transform's position, via `Animation.startTime` |
 * | `Date.now()` (wall clock) | the activity meters' ABSOLUTE bin indices |
 *
 * The first two share the document's time origin, so `anim.startTime = now`
 * makes the time→x map in `sparkline-geometry.ts` and the transform the same
 * function — which is the whole point of injecting one clock here.
 *
 * The third cannot be unified and is CONVERTED, at exactly one seam:
 * {@link SparklineTape.storeNow}. `RateMeter.series(nowMs)` advances an
 * absolute wall-clock bin index, and that advance is the only thing that
 * zero-fills the bins that have gone by — which is the entire mechanism by
 * which a stalled stream decays to a flat line. Hand it a monotonic value
 * (≈1e5) against a head bin minted from wall clock (≈1e12) and it takes its
 * early return every time: the window stops advancing and the tape holds its
 * last level forever. The failure is silent and reads as a data bug.
 *
