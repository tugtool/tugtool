/**
 * slash-commands.ts — registry + matcher for locally-handled slash
 * commands.
 *
 * Some slash commands are *claude's* (`/commit`, skills, agents): typing
 * one sends it to claude, which runs it and streams a
 * real turn. Others are *terminal-rendered-locally* (`/permissions`,
 * `/model`, `/rewind`, …): the terminal handles them itself and claude
 * never sees them. In stream-json / print mode claude has no interactive
 * UI, so a locally-rendered command sent to it bounces with "isn't
 * available in this environment." The session-card reimplements those
 * commands as graphical surfaces — and this module is the single source
 * of truth for which commands are local and how a typed command line is
 * recognized.
 *
 * This is pure data + a pure lookup — no React, no DOM, no store
 * dependency. The completion layer reads {@link LOCAL_SLASH_COMMANDS} to
 * offer the commands in the slash popup ([#step-1c] session-card composition
 * layer); the prompt entry's submit path reads {@link
 * matchLocalSlashCommand} to decide whether a draft is a local command
 * to dispatch or text to send to claude; later command steps ([#step-2b]
 * `/model`, [#step-7]+ etc.) extend the registry; [D14]'s allowlist
 * ([#step-13]) reads the same set.
 *
 * Dispatch + surface ownership live elsewhere: a matched command is
 * dispatched key-card-scoped as `RUN_SLASH_COMMAND` and the session card's
 * card-content responder opens the surface (see [D23] and
 * `session-card.tsx`). Keeping this module surface-agnostic is what lets the
 * matcher run inside the generic `TugPromptEntry` without coupling it to
 * session-card concepts.
 *
