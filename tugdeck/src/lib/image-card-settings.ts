/**
 * image-card-settings.ts — pure helpers for the viewer card's IMAGE
 * settings: the deck-wide defaults a newly opened image adopts, and the
 * per-card values that override them thereafter.
 *
 * No React, no DOM, no I/O — every export is a pure function or a constant,
 * so the parse/resolve logic is unit-testable without a store or a rendered
 * component. Persistence lives in the hook and the defaults store that
 * consume these (`use-image-card-settings.ts`, `default-card-settings-store`).
 * Mirrors `text-card-settings.ts` exactly; a reader who knows one knows both.
 *
 * Two tugbank surfaces, the same default/per-card split the Text card uses:
 *
 *   - Deck-wide defaults at `dev.tugtool.image-card/settings` — edited in the
 *     Settings card's "Viewer Cards" section.
 *   - Per-card values at `dev.image-card/<cardId>` — what the card's own gear
 *     writes. Resolved live from the defaults until the first change, then
 *     card-local.
 *
 * Every field is something the image surface can honor with CSS alone, which
 * is the same discipline the Text card's list follows against CM6: there is
 * no setting here that needs a re-decode or a second copy of the bytes.
 *
