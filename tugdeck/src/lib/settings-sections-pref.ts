/**
 * settings-sections-pref.ts — which Settings section the reader is on.
 *
 * The Settings card is a master/detail tab view: a sidebar of sections on the
 * left, one panel on the right. What is persisted is the **selected section**,
 * so reopening Settings lands the reader where they last were. An absent key
 * (never set) reads as `null` and the card falls back to the first section.
 *
 * Ids outside {@link SETTINGS_SECTION_IDS} read as never-set, which is how a
 * stored id retired by a later build stops steering the card. (Profiles
 * written by the accordion era may still hold a `collapsedSections` entry in
 * this domain; nothing reads it anymore.)
 *
 * Persisted deck-wide through tugbank defaults
 * (`/api/defaults/dev.tugtool.settings-card/selectedSection`, [D07],
 * `feedback_no_localstorage`), not per card: there is at most one Settings
 * card, and where a reader left it is about the reader.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the tugbank cache enters React through `useTugbankValue`.
 *
