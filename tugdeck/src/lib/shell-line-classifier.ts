/**
 * shell-line-classifier — the precondition half of deciding whether an
 * unprefixed, atom-free, single-line draft means the shell or means Claude
 * (Spec S03, [P09]).
 *
 * This module does not decide anything about intent. It brackets the model's
 * judgement from both sides with facts, and the model decides between them.
 *
 * Before: {@link isShellCandidate} asks *does the first word name a program that
 * exists on this machine?* That is checkable against the login PATH, and when
 * the answer is no the line cannot be a command, so no inference is spent on it.
 * Everything past that point — whether the person meant to RUN that program or
 * was writing a sentence that happens to start with its name — is a judgement
 * about English, and the model makes it.
 *
 * Between: tugcast's grammar grader (the `tuggram` crate, reached over the
 * `shell_grammar` verb) asks *does the whole line name things that exist, and do
 * its tokens fit what the program can be shown to accept?* It refines within the
 * candidates {@link isShellCandidate} admits, doing what the deck cannot: lexing
 * past the first token, resolving every segment head of a pipeline, and stating
 * a `stat` on a path-shaped opener — and on a path argument — that the deck can
 * only take on faith. {@link modelCallForBand} is what its four bands mean here.
 * A `yes` runs the line outright: the grader recognized every token against the
 * program's own grammar, so there is no position left for English to occupy and
 * nothing for the model to weigh. Everything short of that is a `maybe` and
 * reaches the model with the program's documentation attached.
 *
 * After: {@link vetoesShellVerdict} asks *is this line shaped like English?* and
 * can refuse to honor a `shell` verdict. It can only refuse; see its own doc for
 * why that makes it a different instrument from the rules described next.
 *
 * An earlier revision tried to make that judgement here, with a stopword list,
 * a list of "ambiguous" openers, and a token-count rule. Those were guesses
 * about English dressed as syntax, and they pre-empted the model on most lines
 * it should have seen: the classifier decided `which bun` and `open .` by
 * itself and delegated only the leftovers. They are gone. The rule now is that
 * anything opening on a real program name is the model's question.
 *
 * The wrong-way costs are asymmetric and that asymmetry sets the whole design.
 * A line sent to Claude that meant the shell costs one keystroke to retype with
 * `!shell`. A line sent to the shell that meant Claude has **already executed**
 * — the auto-routed row offers "send to Claude instead", but nothing un-runs
 * the command. So every degraded path here resolves to Claude: no model, no
 * PATH set, no verdict, a timeout, a malformed answer, no grammar store. The
 * shell is reached two ways only: a `yes` from the grader, which is a statement
 * of fact about the line's tokens rather than a judgement about its meaning, or
 * an explicit `shell` verdict from the model that survives the veto.
 *
 * Routing is decided once, at submit, over the **whole line**. There is no
 * opener-only judgement while the user types: the set of English words that are
 * also PATH executables is large (`write`, `say`, `who`, `last`, `join`,
 * `split`, `yes`, `top`, `sleep`, …) and varies by machine, so a first-word
 * test cannot tell `write me a haiku` from `write kocienda ttys001` and has no
 * line context yet to help it.
 *
 * Pure — no side effects, no store reads. The caller enforces the rest of the
 * precondition (the draft has no atoms; `text` is trimmed and single-line),
 * supplies the login-PATH command set (null until it loads, which answers
 * Claude — the safety net, not the steady state), and supplies its own
 * readiness.

 * exists — and nothing else produces one. A stale catalog, a wrapper script, a

 * `yes` is the one band that decides, and it decides toward the shell: the line
 * runs with no model call and no veto. That is not an exception to this
 * module's asymmetry, it is what the band is defined to mean. A `yes` requires
 * the grammar to have *recognized* every token — a known flag, a known
 * subcommand, an enumerated value, a path that exists — so there is no position
 * left in the line for English to occupy. `make the watch loop resilient` does
 * not reach here: `make`'s positionals are free, the grammar recognizes none of
 * those four words, and the line grades `maybe`. Any line the grader cannot
 * account for token by token is a `maybe`, which is the model's question with
 * the program's documentation attached.
 *
 * The other unilateral decision is `no` → Claude. Both fall in the direction
 * doubt is supposed to fall, because a `yes` is not doubt.
