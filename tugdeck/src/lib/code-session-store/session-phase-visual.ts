/**
 * session-phase-visual.ts — Map a CodeSession's (phase, transport,
 * interrupt, running-jobs) state onto the {@link TugProgressIndicator}
 * `phase` / `phaseLabels` / `phaseVisual` API.
 *
 * The session-phase model has several orthogonal axes — `phase`,
 * `transportState`, `interruptInFlight`, and the background-jobs
 * ledger — but a UI indicator only needs one identifier per render.
 * {@link sessionSessionPhaseKey} flattens them into a stable string
 * key; {@link SESSION_PHASE_LABELS} maps every key to its
 * human-readable title (used for the indicator's visible label and
 * tooltip); and {@link sessionSessionPhaseVisual} maps every key to a
 * partial `{ role, state }` for the indicator's visual treatment.
 *
 * Transport health dominates phase: an offline wire reads as
 * `aborted/danger` regardless of the reducer's phase; a restoring
 * wire reads as `running/caution`. An in-flight interrupt promotes
 * the indicator to `running/caution` so the user sees that the stop
 * request has not been lost between request and ack. Otherwise the
 * phase enum drives the visual.
 *
 * The reducer's `phase` is a *turn* lifecycle: it answers whether the
 * conversational turn is in flight and whether the composer may
 * submit. `idle` therefore means "no turn in flight" — which is not
 * the same as "this session is done". A backgrounded agent runs after
 * its launching turn commits, so a session can sit at `idle` with
 * agents still working. The `background` key exists so the indicator
 * does not report that session as quiet; it is a presentation key
 * only, and the reducer's phase enum is untouched by it.
 *
 * `pendingAsk` rides the same "presentation key only" seam, for the
 * mirror-image reason. A session is Awaiting whenever a dialog is
 * holding the user's answer, and there are three such dialogs:
 * `PermissionDialog` and `QuestionWizard` reach this function through
 * the reducer, which really does set `phase: "awaiting_approval"` when
 * their `control_request_forward` lands. `AppTestAskDialog` cannot —
 * it arrives over `/api/ask`, belongs to no turn, and usually finds the
 * session idle, so writing that phase would make `canSubmit` false and
 * `canInterrupt` true: a dead composer and a live Stop button with
 * nothing to stop. Flattening it here instead reports Awaiting off the
 * one axis the indicator actually reads, and leaves the turn machine
 * alone. All three dialogs therefore read Awaiting; only two of them
 * are turn phases.
 *
 * Migrated from the legacy `TugStateIndicator` — the visual
 * vocabulary is preserved; the API shape is reshaped to the unified
 * indicator's phase axis.

/**

 * Mapping:
 *
 *  - `offline`, `errored`        → `{ role: danger,  state: aborted }`
 *  - `restoring`, `interrupting` → `{ role: caution, state: running }`
 *  - `awaiting_approval`         → `{ role: caution, state: running }`
 *  - active stream phases        → `{ role: action,  state: running }`
 *  - `background`                → `{ role: agent,   state: running }`
 *  - `idle`                      → `{ role: inherit, state: stopped }`
 *
 * `action` (Key) is the canonical "work in flight" tone across the
 * design system. `success` is reserved for the "done" reading
 * (`state: completed`) — paired together they give a clear
 * key-while-running → green-when-finished story.
 *
 * `background` breathes: agents launched by a committed turn are
 * executing this instant, which is exactly what `running` claims, so
 * the liveness rule is satisfied rather than bent. What separates it
 * from a live turn is tone, not motion — the `agent` role, which
 * carries its own token in every theme.
