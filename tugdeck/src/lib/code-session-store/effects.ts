 *
 *  Only one channel today: `"text"` — append-only text for
 *  `assistant_text` / `assistant_thinking` / `system_note` Messages.
 *  `TugMarkdownBlock` subscribes to the resulting path and writes the
 *  rendered DOM imperatively per delta (per [L22]) — bypassing React's
 *  render cycle, which is what makes per-token streaming smooth.
 *
 *  Tool-use state is NOT a streaming channel. `ToolUseMessage` mutates
 *  a small number of times per call (mint, input fill, result,
 *  structuredResult) and tool blocks are React components that
 *  re-render normally on snapshot updates; piping them through
 *  PropertyStore would duplicate the snapshot's authority without a
 *  perf win. The state channel from [D07]'s sketch was a placeholder
 *  for a perf concern the snapshot model already resolves.
 *
 *  Per-Message paths mean a committed cell can keep observing its own
 *  path forever without being polluted by other Messages' writes —
 *  the [L26] mount-identity foundation that lets each Message's
 *  streaming subscription survive the inflight → committed transition.
