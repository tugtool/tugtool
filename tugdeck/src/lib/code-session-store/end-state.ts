/**
 * Pure-logic helpers for the Z1 asst-half end-state display.
 *
 * Used by the gallery's `gallery-tide-asst-half-stack.tsx` workshop
 * card and (when 20.4.15 lands) by the production tide-card Z1
 * asst-half renderer. The helpers are pinned here, not inline in
 * the gallery, so the mapping from `TurnEndReason` to badge text
 * and tone has one source of truth across the workshop and
 * production callsites.
 *
 * The end-state display surfaces three pieces of post-turn
 * information:
 *   - A terminal-state badge (OK / interrupted / errored / lost)
 *   - The turn's active-ms (machine-doing-work time)
 *   - The turn's per-turn token count (the context-window delta)
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no React, no side effects. Safe to call from
 * `useMemo` / render bodies.

 * The roles a terminal-state badge can take. Subset of

 * helper's contract honest about its output set.
 *
 * `"inherit"` (vs the coloured tones) is the deliberate choice for
 * the `complete` outcome: in a transcript of many committed rows
 * the green "OK" dots otherwise compound into a vertical column
 * that draws the eye away from message content. The actionable
 * outcomes (`interrupted` / `error` / `transport_lost`) keep
 * their coloured tones because attention IS warranted there.

 * attention. `transport_lost` is mapped to `caution` (not
 * `danger`) because the wire-loss path is recoverable — a
 * reconnect can deliver the outstanding output; `caution` reads
 * as "look at this" rather than "this failed."  `interrupted` is

 * The per-turn token count shown on the Z1B asst-half — how much this

 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * Z1B shows a **per-turn delta**, never a turn's gross API usage.
 * Gross usage re-reads the entire prior conversation as `cache_read`
 * every turn, so it tracks context size and would never sum to
 * anything meaningful. The delta does:
 *
 *   `perTurnTokens(turn N) = window(N) − window(N−1)`
 *
 * where `window` is {@link turnWindowTokens} — `input + output +
 * cache_read + cache_creation`, every term straight from
 * `cost_update.usage`. No local tokenizer; all feed numbers.
 *
 * The deltas telescope: `session-init + Σ perTurnTokens = window(last)`
 * — the live context rollup, exactly, by construction.
 *
 * **First turn** (`prevCost === undefined`): the prior window is the
 * session-init bootstrap (system prompt + tools + agents + memory +
 * skills), which equals this turn's *observed input* (`input +
 * cache_read + cache_creation` — the model's input, minus its
 * output). So the first turn's delta degenerates to its `output`: the
 * bootstrap is attributed to session-init and never charged to turn 1.
 *
 * Clamped ≥ 0 to defend against a non-monotonic window (e.g.
 * prompt-cache eviction shrinking `cache_read` between turns).
