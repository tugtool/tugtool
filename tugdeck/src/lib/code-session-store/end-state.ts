 * source of truth.
 *
 * The end-state display surfaces three pieces of post-turn
 * information:
 *   - A terminal-state badge (OK / interrupted / errored / lost)
 *   - The turn's active-ms (machine-doing-work time)
 *   - The turn's per-turn token count (the context-window delta)
 *
 * Pure: no DOM, no React, no side effects. Safe to call from
 * `useMemo` / render bodies.

 * helper's contract honest about its output set.
 *
 * `"inherit"` (vs the coloured tones) is the deliberate choice for
 * the `complete` outcome: in a transcript of many committed rows
 * the green "OK" dots otherwise compound into a vertical column
 * that draws the eye away from message content. The actionable
 * outcomes (`interrupted` / `error` / `transport_lost`) keep

 * | `complete`        | —               | "OK"                 | inherit  |
 * | `interrupted`     | (none)          | "Interrupted"        | caution  |
 * | `interrupted`     | `logout`        | "Stopped — logged out" | caution  |

 * the surrounding text colour and blends into the row's rhythm —
 * saving the coloured palettes for outcomes that warrant
 * attention. `transport_lost` is mapped to `caution` (not
 * `danger`) because the wire-loss path is recoverable — a
 * reconnect can deliver the outstanding output; `caution` reads
 * as "look at this" rather than "this failed."  `interrupted` is
 * also `caution` because the user initiated the stop; it isn't a
 * system error.
 *
 * `interruptReason` refines the `interrupted` label: a turn stopped by
 * the app-level logout flow (`"logout"`) reads "Stopped — logged out"
 * instead of a bare "Interrupted", keeping the same `caution` tone. It
 * is the one helper both the Z1B footer and the telemetry popover call,
 * so both surfaces stay in sync ([D19]).
