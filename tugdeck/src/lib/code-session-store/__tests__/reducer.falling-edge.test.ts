/**
 * The falling-edge audit: every way a turn can die must put the session
 * back on a phase that stops the in-flight indicators.
 *
 * The Z1C wave and the Z2 STATE dot are pure functions of `phase` (and
 * `interruptInFlight`) — nothing else gates them. So a wave still bowing
 * on a settled deck is never a CSS bug and never a mount bug: it is a
 * turn that ended without any event moving `phase` off a live value.
 * That is the defect this file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * The matrix is live phase × terminal event. Each live phase is reached
 * by driving the real reducer with real events (no hand-built states —
 * a fabricated `phase` would test the assertion, not the machine), then
 * each terminal event is dispatched and the resulting phase checked
 * against {@link QUIET_PHASES}.
 *
 * `interrupt_action` is the one terminal that legitimately leaves the
 * phase live: CASE B dooms the turn but waits for the wire's
 * `turn_complete(error)` to commit it. It stops the indicators anyway,
 * via `interruptInFlight` — so it is audited on that gate instead, and
 * on the requirement that the turn actually reaches quiet once the echo
 * lands.
