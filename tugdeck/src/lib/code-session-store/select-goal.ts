/**
 * Goal-state model + pure reducers for the `/goal` command.
 *
 * A `/goal <condition>` run is ONE result cycle on the wire: claude's
 * Stop-hook evaluator injects synthetic user events into the same cycle to
 * keep the assistant working, and tugcode translates each into a
 * `goal_feedback` IPC frame (condition + the evaluator's latest reason).
 * There is no dedicated goal-state wire event, so everything the deck knows
 * about a goal is reduced from three signals (probe-pinned in
 * `tugcode/probes/goal-loop/FINDINGS.md#q01-goal`):
 *
 *   1. the user's own `/goal …` submission (set / clear / status),
 *   2. `goal_feedback` frames while the run is live,
 *   3. the goal cycle's terminal `turn_complete` (achieved).
 *
 * Lifetime rules (plan S04, `roadmap/slash-command-plan.md`):
 *   - live-only — replay never populates goal state (`add_user_message`
 *     frames are not reduced here, and tugcode's replay translator skips
 *     `isSynthetic` entries), so a reloaded card starts with `goal: null`;
 *   - a goal survives a respawn in-memory as possibly-active — the next
 *     observed signal settles it;
 *   - residual feedback after a clear never resurrects (the evaluator can
 *     trail a `/goal clear` by a round or two).
