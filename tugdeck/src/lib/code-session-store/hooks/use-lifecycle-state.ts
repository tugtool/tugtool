/**
 * `useLifecycleState` — subscribes a dev-card component to its
 * `CodeSessionStore` and projects the matrix-row lifecycle
 * snapshot. Every zone that coordinates on lifecycle (Z5's submit
 * button, the transcript-replay paint gate, Z2 / Z4) reads this one
 * hook so the matrix has a single executable source of truth.
 *
 * Composition:
 *   1. `useSyncExternalStore` on the `CodeSessionStore` — the [L02]
 *      boundary for external state.
 *   2. `deriveLifecycleSnapshot(storeSnapshot, previous)` — the pure
 *      matrix projection, threaded with the previous result from a
 *      per-card `useRef` so [DT09] reference stability holds per card
 *      (a module-level cache would thrash when two cards stream at
 *      once).
 *
 * Conformance:
 *   - [L02] — `useSyncExternalStore` is the only external-state
 *     subscription; `lifecycle-state.ts` itself is pure.
 *   - [DT09] — see `lifecycle-state.ts`.
 *
 * The hook's React glue (`useSyncExternalStore` + the `useRef` render
 * cache) is left to real-app / integration coverage per the project's
 * no-fake-DOM rule; the pure `deriveLifecycleSnapshot` it wraps is
 * unit-tested exhaustively in `__tests__/lifecycle-state.test.ts`.
 *
 * @module lib/code-session-store/hooks/use-lifecycle-state
