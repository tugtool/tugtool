/**
 * `useTaskListState` — derive the current task list ([D100]) from a
 * `CodeSessionStore` snapshot.
 *
 * Walks every committed turn's `messages` filtered to `tool_use`, then
 * the in-flight turn's `activeTurn.messages` (same filter), feeding the
 * concatenated stream into {@link reduceTaskListState}. The two are
 * disjoint by `tool_use_id` (each turn carries its own ids), so
 * concatenation is safe and order-preserving for the reducer's
 * `TaskCreate` → `TaskUpdate` pairing.
 *
 * **Persistence, not turn-scoping.** The wire never emits a "clear"
 * frame for the task list (verified against the v2.1.150 fixtures and
 * live session 45208c42 — each user prompt's `promptId` owns its own
 * Task* events, with no reset signal between prompts). The fold is
 * therefore unconditional: every Task* event across the whole
 * transcript folds into the current batch, and the list persists across
 * turn boundaries. It clears only when the reducer's batch-boundary
 * supersede fires — a fresh `TaskCreate` arriving over a
 * fully-completed list starts a new batch — so accumulated history
 * never piles up.
 *
 * An earlier revision gated visibility on whether the *latest turn* had
 * a Task* event, returning the empty state otherwise. That collapsed
 * the whole checklist to zero the instant a new turn opened (before it
 * streamed its first Task* frame), then restored it — the observed
 * "6/7 → None → restored" flicker. The gate is gone; the WORK cell's
 * completion linger governs the graceful settle to "None" instead.
 *
 * Under [D07] the in-flight tool calls live on the snapshot directly
 * (`activeTurn.messages`) — the previous implementation subscribed to
 * a PropertyStore path that mirrored them as JSON. Reading from the
 * snapshot eliminates the parallel storage and keeps the substrate the
 * single source of truth.
 *
 * Returns a stable {@link TaskListState}. Re-derives only when one of
 * the inputs (`transcript` / `activeTurn.messages`) changes identity.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] external state through `useSyncExternalStore`.
