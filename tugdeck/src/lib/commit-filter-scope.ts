/**
 * commit-filter-scope.ts — which parts of a commit the History filter reads.
 *
 * A query that should have found one commit finds thirty when it is matched
 * against everything: a word common in file paths swamps the one commit whose
 * subject says it. So the reader aims the filter — four independent surfaces,
 * all on by default:
 *
 *  - `hash`    — the commit's sha, at its full 40 characters even though rows
 *                show eight, so a hash pasted from anywhere finds its commit.
 *  - `message` — the subject and the message body.
 *  - `detail`  — who and when: author, committer, email, and the date stamps
 *                AS DISPLAYED (so `July 24` matches what the row shows).
 *  - `files`   — the paths the commit touched.
 *
 * Hash leads the group because it is the narrowest of the four — one commit,
 * exactly — and because a query of bare hex is the one query that wants nothing
 * else looked at.
 *
 * All four off is a real state, not an error: the reader has switched every
 * surface off and nothing can match until one comes back. That is why a missing
 * entry (never set) and an empty entry (set to nothing) must stay
 * distinguishable — the former falls back to the default, the latter doesn't.
 * The shade says as much when a query in that state finds nothing.
 *
 * Persisted deck-wide through tugbank defaults
 * (`/api/defaults/dev.commit-filter/history-scope`, [D07],
 * `feedback_no_localstorage`), not per card: how a reader aims a filter is
 * about the reader, the same argument the row-metadata choice makes.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the tugbank cache enters React through `useTugbankValue`.
 *
