/**
 * open-attachment — what ⌘-clicking a document's relative link does.
 *
 * A link in a document names a file. The gesture should always do something
 * with that file, and what it does depends on what the file *is*:
 *
 *  - An image or a PDF opens in a viewer card.
 *  - Anything textual — the `.md` next door, a `.txt` in `assets/`, a `.csv`,
 *    a source file — opens in a Text card.
 *  - Anything else is revealed in the Finder, where the user can hand it to
 *    the app that owns it. A `.zip` or a `.sketch` has no in-app answer, and
 *    opening one in a Text card would paint its bytes as mojibake.
 *  - A file that is not there is revealed too, which lands the user in the
 *    directory it should have been in.
 *
 * The gate used to be `isViewableFile`, so only the first case did anything at
 * all and every other link was inert — a `.md` attachment sat there dead
 * beside a `.png` that opened. Widening the gate needed an answer for the
 * `.zip`, and "reveal it" is that answer.
 *
 * ## Why the kind is decided at click time
 *
 * There is no reliable answer from the name alone: `classifyFileKind` returns
 * `"text"` as its *default*, so a `.zip` and a `.md` are indistinguishable to
 * it. The real answer is in the bytes, so this reads the file's first block and
 * looks. That is an async question, which is exactly why it is asked on the
 * click rather than on the hover: the link lights up for every file, and the
 * decision happens where waiting is free.
 *
