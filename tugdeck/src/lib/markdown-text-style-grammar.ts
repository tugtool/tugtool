/**
 * markdown-text-style-grammar.ts — the one parser configuration behind the
 * `markdownTextStyle` scheme.
 *
 * The scheme's rule: markdown is styled *visually* and **never stops being a
 * text document**. Every syntax character — `#`, `*`, `` ` ``, `>`, `~~`, the
 * fence delimiters, the two trailing spaces of a hard break — stays in the
 * buffer and stays on screen, taking a marker tone rather than disappearing
 * into a rendered heading or a rendered rule. Nothing is folded, concealed,
 * or substituted.
 *
 * The scheme has two forms, and they must paint the same source identically:
 *
 *  - the one-shot filter, `applyMarkdownTextStyle` in `lib/markdown-text-styling.ts`,
 *    which backs the read-only `TugMarkdownText`;
 *  - the CM6 extension bundle, `loadMarkdownTextStyling` in
 *    `components/tugways/tug-text-editor/markdown-text-styling.ts`, which backs
 *    every markdown-styled editing surface.
 *
 * They used to configure a parser each, and drifted — the filter parsed GFM
 * while the editor parsed strict CommonMark, so a task list styled in a receipt
 * and not in the composer that wrote it. This module is the single parser both
 * now use, which makes their agreement structural instead of a matter of
 * remembering.
 *
 * The dialect is GFM: `markdownLanguage` is CommonMark plus tables, task
 * lists, strikethrough, and bare autolinks — what people actually write in
 * commit messages and prompts.
 *
 * Four options turn *editing* behaviors off, because this capability styles
 * and does not edit:
 *  - `addKeymap: false` — the markdown keymap would take Enter and Backspace
 *    on list lines, breaking submit-on-Return in the prompt entry.
 *  - `pasteURLAsLink: false` — would fight the substrate's clipboard extension.
 *  - `completeHTMLTags: false` — the substrate runs its own typeahead.
 *  - `autoCloseTags: false` on the HTML sub-language — `html()`'s support array
 *    carries an `EditorView.inputHandler` that inserts `</div>` when you type
 *    `<div>`. It reaches the editor through `markdown()`'s `htmlTagLanguage`
 *    default, so it arrived as a default rather than as a decision. It is an
 *    editing behavior and it is excluded on the same grounds as the keymap.
 *    The HTML *language* stays, which is what sub-parses inline and block HTML.
 *

// paragraph repaints the whole paragraph above as a heading until the item's
// first character arrives.
//
// The grammar's own list check declines the line for the same reason: with
// `breaking` set, a bullet only interrupts a paragraph when content follows
// the marker. So the paragraph is ended here instead, by an `endLeaf` rule
// that fires before the leaf-block parsers get their look. The block parse
// that follows sees the bare marker with `breaking` unset and takes it as an
// empty list item.
