/**
 * shade-view-controller — per-card visibility of the transcript-slot Shades.
 *
 * The Session card's view slot holds three mutually-exclusive panes:
 * the transcript, the Changes Shade, and the History Shade. Which one is
 * showing is card chrome state — a deliberate view choice — not session
 * data and not a submission target. `ShadeViewController` holds that
 * choice as a subscribable store.
 *
 * One instance per Session card body, owned via a lazy `useRef` (never in
 * `services` — it is chrome, not session data). Readers:
 *
 *   - the view-slot render, via `useSyncExternalStore` ([L02]);
 *   - `useMenuStatePublication`, via a direct subscription ([L22]);
 *   - the slash-command surfaces, which call `show` imperatively;
 *   - the toggle action handlers, which call `toggle`;
 *   - the Shade close affordances, which call `hide`.
 *
 * `"none"` is the resting state (both Shades closed). `show` is
 * mutually-exclusive: showing one Shade while the other is up swaps them,
 * exactly like the old view-route flip — all three panes stay mounted and
 * only CSS visibility changes ([L26]/[L06]).
 *
 * @module lib/shade-view-controller
