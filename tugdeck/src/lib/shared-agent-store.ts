/**
 * shared-agent-store — the deck's view of the SharedAgent's tenant switches.
 *
 * The agent itself lives in tugcast; nothing on this side runs a model or knows
 * how one is spawned. What the deck needs is narrower: whether a tenant is
 * switched on, and whether there is a socket to ask over.
 *
 * That pair *is* readiness. There is deliberately no "can the agent answer right
 * now" probe to go with them, because the answer would be worthless: the agent
 * is a remote model over the user's subscription, so the only honest way to know
 * whether it can answer is to ask it, and every caller already degrades cleanly
 * when it cannot. A readiness probe would add a round trip to learn something
 * the next round trip settles anyway, and would go stale between the asking and
 * the acting.
 *
 * [L02] `useSyncExternalStore` over the tugbank client's change notifications;
 * no local persistence.
