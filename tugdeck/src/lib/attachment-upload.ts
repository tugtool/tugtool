/**
 * `attachment-upload` — the deck's side of tugcast's two attachment routes.
 *
 * An attachment is a file somewhere on disk and a short string the surface
 * holds. This module is where the deck turns dropped bytes into that string:
 *
 *  - {@link uploadDraftAttachment} sends a composer image's **original** bytes
 *    to `POST /api/attachments` and comes back with the absolute path tugcast
 *    rested them at. What the bytes-store holds is the *downsampled* copy —
 *    the caps exist for API-payload reasons and baking them into storage would
 *    destroy data — so a draft that survives a relaunch resubmits at exactly
 *    the quality one that didn't would.
 *  - {@link rehydrateDraftAttachments} is the return trip: a restored entry
 *    that carries a path and no bytes is read back through `/api/fs/blob`,
 *    run through the downsample pipeline, and put whole. This is the same
 *    fetch-decode-put shape the Gazette's attachment strip has shipped, down
 *    to the in-flight interlock and the chunked base64 conversion, which both
 *    callers now share from here.
 *  - {@link uploadDocAttachment} is the document tier: a file dropped on a
 *    Text card is copied into an `assets/` folder beside the document it is
 *    being dropped on, and the response carries the relative name the markdown
 *    link should use. Those bytes are the user's, in the user's own directory,
 *    reachable by any tool that reads the file — which is the whole point of
 *    not putting them in a database.
 *
 * The media type sent up is always the dropped `File`'s own, never the
 * downsample pipeline's output type: a PNG that hits the JPEG quality ladder
 * comes back from the pipeline as `image/jpeg`, and deriving the stored
 * extension from that would write PNG bytes into a `.jpg` that `/api/fs/blob`
 * then serves as `Content-Type: image/jpeg`.
 *
 * Every failure here is survivable. A refused type, an unreachable server, a
 * body over the limit — all of them leave the entry without a `path`, which
 * degrades to the behavior that shipped before any of this existed: the chip
 * works for this session and does not come back after a relaunch.
