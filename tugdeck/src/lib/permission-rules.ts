/**
 * permission-rules.ts — pure data model + helpers for Claude Code's
 * tool-permission **rules** (`/permissions`), distinct from the permission
 * *mode* ([permission-mode.ts]).
 *
 * A rule is a matcher string (`Bash(ls:*)`, `WebSearch`, `Read(./.env)`) living
 * in one of three writable scopes — user / project / local — each a
 * `permissions: { allow, ask, deny, additionalDirectories }` object in a
 * settings file. tugcast's `/api/permissions` endpoint reads every scope and
 * mutates one rule at a time (see `permission-rules-store.ts`); this module is
 * the pure layer the store and the editor sheet share: parse a matcher, build
 * the scope-labeled union for a bucket, and filter by search query.
 *
 * Scope precedence (Managed > CLI > Local > Project > User) and the merge-not-
 * override semantics are Claude Code's, captured in
 * `roadmap/transport-exploration.md`. The dev card edits the three writable
 * scopes; Managed is admin-only and never surfaced here.
 *
 * Pure: no React, no DOM, no fetch — just types and total functions.
 *
 * @module lib/permission-rules
