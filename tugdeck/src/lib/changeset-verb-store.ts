/**
 * Changeset card CONTROL verbs — app-level round-trip store.
 *
 * Two verbs ride here. `changeset_git_init { project_dir }` is the non-repo
 * "Initialize git" affordance: the deck sends the CONTROL request and
 * tugcast's supervisor replies `changeset_git_init_ok { project_dir }` /
 * `changeset_git_init_err { project_dir, detail }` (Spec S07). On success the
 * server fires the aggregate recompute, so the project's section self-heals to
 * a clean repo and drops its Init affordance — there is no client-side flip;
 * this store only tracks the in-flight request and any error to surface.
 *
 * `changeset_commit { project_dir, files, message }` commits exactly the
 * card-selected files (Spec S03, [P15]); the reply carries the new HEAD sha
 * and the numstat receipt (`_ok {sha, receipt}`) or the git stderr detail
 * (`_err {detail}`). Commit state is keyed by the initiating card *entry*
 * (the response only names the project, so the store correlates through a
 * project→entry in-flight map).
 *
 * `changeset_claim { project_dir, session_id, files }` promotes hinted files
 * into a session's changeset ([D120]); the reply carries the count actually
 * written (`_ok {claimed}`) or a guard's refusal (`_err {detail}`). Success
 * shows itself — the rows migrate on the next aggregate recompute — but a
 * refusal has no other surface, so the round trip is tracked and keyed by the
 * initiating card entry the way commit is.
 *
 * `changeset_disclaim { project_dir, session_id, files }` is claim's inverse:
 * the session renounces the listed files and they fall to another live owner or
 * back to unattributed. The reply carries the ledger rows deleted
 * (`_ok {disclaimed}`) or a guard's refusal (`_err {detail}`), and is tracked
 * and keyed exactly as claim is.
 *
 * Git-init state is keyed by `project_dir` (several non-repo projects can be
 * open at once). Consumed via {@link useChangesetGitInit} /
 * {@link useChangesetCommit} / {@link useChangesetClaim} /
 * {@link useChangesetDisclaim}; attached once at app boot with
 * {@link attachChangesetVerbStore}.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] external state enters React through useSyncExternalStore only.
