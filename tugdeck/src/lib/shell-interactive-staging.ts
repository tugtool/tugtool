/**
 * Interactive-staging detection for the `$` route ([P13]).
 *
 * `git add -p` and its relatives are prompting UIs over patch surgery. The
 * block shell has no TTY — a command's stdin is `/dev/null` — so they read EOF
 * immediately and stage nothing while exiting 0. That is the worst possible
 * outcome: a no-op that looks like success. Rather than run one, the route
 * answers with a steering notice.
 *
 * This is not a step toward a terminal emulator ([D111] stands). The graphical
 * surface *is* the answer to `git add -p`: the Changes shade picks hunks, and
 * `tugutil file stage --patch` is the non-interactive verb for a script or an
 * agent.
 *
 * Detection is a literal-token scan — no grammar, no execution, no shelling
 * out. It is quote-aware only so far as it must be: `git commit -m "add -p
 * support"` names no flag, and treating the quoted `-p` as one would refuse a
 * perfectly ordinary commit.
