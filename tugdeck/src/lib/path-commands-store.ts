/**
 * path-commands-store — the deck cache of everything the shell-line classifier
 * needs to decide a typed line could name a command ([P08], Spec S02).
 *
 * The membership question is "will this session's shell resolve this word?",
 * and two sources answer it together: the login-PATH executable set, and the
 * session shell's own aliases, functions and builtins. tugcast replies to one
 * `path_commands` request with a frame for each — `path_commands` and
 * `shell_words` — and this store holds them separately and hands out their
 * union. Names only: membership is all the classifier asks, and shipping the
 * expansions would put a second copy of them somewhere nobody could keep
 * coherent with the shell.
 *
 * One instance per Session card session, sharing the card's `SHELL_OUTPUT`
 * `FeedStore` (no new feed — the same session-scoped filter the shell session
 * store uses). `request()` fires the verb once, at session bind, so the set is
 * warm before the first submit, and carries the card's project dir because the
 * word dump's shell stands there and rc files branch on where they are.
 *
 * `getSnapshot()` returns `null` until the `path_commands` reply lands — the
 * classifier treats null as "answer Code", the safety net that keeps the first
 * command-shaped line of a session from misrouting while the set loads. A
 * `shell_words` frame arriving first is held aside and unioned in when the
 * command set lands, so that net keeps exactly one trigger.
 *
 * tugcast also *pushes* a fresh `path_commands` frame when the PATH set changes
 * under a running session, so a `brew install` becomes routable without a
 * reload. Every fold is idempotent for that reason.
 *
 * [L02] store surface (`subscribe` / `getSnapshot`); [L22] direct feed read.
 *
 * @module lib/path-commands-store
