/**
 * resize-episode — hold a scroller's content still while its card changes width.
 *
 * A width change re-wraps content: the scroll element survives, `scrollTop`
 * survives with it, and the line it used to name is now somewhere else. WebKit
 * does not implement CSS scroll anchoring (`overflow-anchor`), so the anchoring
 * is ours.
 *
 * An *episode* brackets a width gesture. `beginResizeEpisode(frame)` walks the
 * pane frame for preservable scrollers and dispatches a cancelable
 * `tug-scroll-preserve-begin` on each; `handle.end()` dispatches
 * `tug-scroll-preserve-end`. A scroller that owns real anchor semantics — a
 * virtualized list keyed on cell index, a CodeMirror view keyed on line —
 * listens for begin, captures its own anchor, and calls `preventDefault()` to
 * claim itself. Everything else falls through to the generic element anchor
 * below, which is what CSS scroll anchoring would have done.
 *
 * This is the same shape as the `tug-region-scroll-set` protocol in
 * `card-host.tsx` — cancelable event first, framework fallback second — applied
 * to a second occasion. Discovery is the same selector, so a scroller that opted
 * into cross-mount region preservation is preserved across resize for free.
 *
 * Scroll position is DOM authority and is written directly, never through React
 * state ([L06]); the episode registry is module-level for the same reason. Every
 * observer and timer this module acquires is released by `end()` ([L27]).
