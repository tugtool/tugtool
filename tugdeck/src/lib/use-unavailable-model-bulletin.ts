/**
 * use-unavailable-model-bulletin.ts — card-level reconciliation of a saved
 * model selector against claude's live catalog, with a bulletin only when the
 * pick is genuinely gone.
 *
 * A card seeded with a *concrete* selector (per-card persisted, else the deck
 * default — never the `default` zero-state) is checked against the persisted
 * live catalog at mount, and one of three things happens:
 *
 *  - **Offered** — nothing to do.
 *  - **Respelled** — claude offers the same model under a different selector
 *    string (`claude-fable-5` → `claude-fable-5[1m]` when the 1M variant
 *    became the offered form). The saved value is quietly rewritten to the
 *    current spelling; the user keeps the model they chose and sees nothing.
 *    Matching lives in [model-selector.ts], which knows which respellings name
 *    the same model.
 *  - **Gone** — no catalog row could be that model. Only then is the pick
 *    reset to `default` and the pane-modal alert presented, pointing the user
 *    at Settings → Assistant.
 *
 * Both writes go back to the key the seed *came from* — the card's own
 * selector when it has one, otherwise the deck-wide default. Repairing the
 * source is what keeps the condition from recurring on every other card that
 * inherits the same stale default.
 *
 * The check runs against the **raw persisted** values, not the narrowed
 * parses: the whole point is to see the selector as stored. Membership is
 * tested against the *persisted* catalog only — when no live catalog has ever
 * been persisted (fresh install) the check is skipped, so a card can never be
 * reset on no evidence.
 *
 * Laws: [L07] the mount effect reads current state straight from the tugbank
 * cache, not a render closure; the alert rides the card's sheet host ([D15]).
 *
