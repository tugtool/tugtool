/**
 * help-content.ts — pure content + command projection for the `/help` sheet
 * ([#step-13b2]).
 *
 * The `/help` sheet ([D16]) mirrors the Claude Code terminal's tabbed help:
 * a **General** tab (what the Session card is + key shortcuts + a pointer to the
 * unsupported-commands doc), a **Commands** tab (the built-in slash commands),
 * and a **Custom commands** tab (plugin / user skills + agents). This module is
 * the pure, testable core: the static General-tab copy and a projection of the
 * session command catalog into the two browsable lists.
 *
 * The command projection is the same allowlist policy the slash popup applies
 * ([D14]): hidden commands ([#step-13a]) never appear, and the [D23]
 * local-command registry is always present (with its curated descriptions) so
 * the list is useful even before the `initialize` handshake catalog lands. The
 * result is "exactly what the popup offers," grouped built-in vs custom and
 * sorted alphabetically — matching the terminal's two browse sections.
 *
 * Pure data + a pure projection — no React, no DOM, no store dependency.
 *
 * @module lib/help-content
