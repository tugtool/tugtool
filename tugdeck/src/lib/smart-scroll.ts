/**
 * SmartScroll — scroll state machine and auto-scroll manager.
 *
 * Models UIScrollView/UIScrollViewDelegate for the web. Manages a scroll
 * container element, tracks scroll phases (idle, tracking, dragging,
 * decelerating, programmatic), provides programmatic scroll methods, fires
 * lifecycle callbacks, and owns two built-in scroll-position policies:
 * auto-follow-bottom (pin to the live edge as content grows) and
 * cold-boot scroll restore (re-place the scroller at a saved
 * mid-content position via a consumer-supplied resolver). The two are
 * mutually exclusive — engaging the live edge clears a pending restore.
 *
 * Architecture [D93]:
 *   The state machine is the guard for distinguishing user scrolls from
 *   programmatic or DOM-manipulation-caused scrolls. No timing hacks, no
 *   rAF+setTimeout, no flags cleared after arbitrary delays.
 *
 *   Six listeners:
 *   1. scroll on container (passive) — onScroll callback, lastScrollTop update,
 *      phase transitions, follow-bottom re-engagement, and the idle-phase
 *      unattributed disengage (native scrollbar drags emit no pointer or
 *      wheel events; an idle upward scroll we did not cause is the user).
 *   2. scrollend on container — terminal signal for deceleration and programmatic
 *      animation. Feature-detected at construction; 150ms timer fallback for
 *      browsers without it.
 *   3. pointerdown on container (passive) — enters TRACKING phase.
 *   4. pointerup/pointercancel on document (passive) — exits DRAGGING; 50ms check
 *      determines whether DECELERATING follows (via SETTLING phase).
 *   5. wheel on container (passive) — skips TRACKING, enters DRAGGING immediately;
 *      disengages follow-bottom on deltaY < 0.
 *   6. keydown on container — scroll keys skip TRACKING, enter DRAGGING immediately.
 *      Only scroll-up keys disengage follow-bottom.
 *
 * Not a React hook — a plain class that manages DOM listeners directly.
 * Callers create an instance and call dispose() when done.
 *
 * Modeled after UIScrollView/UIScrollViewDelegate.
 * Studied from use-stick-to-bottom (StackBlitz Labs, MIT license).
 * See THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md.

  /** Pin to bottom when `shouldAutoPin` — the convenience wrapper for the
   *  pure-pin case (a ResizeObserver fire, a spacer reflow, a post-commit
   *  re-window). The underlying `pinToBottom` is idempotent, so a call
   *  that passes the gate but finds scrollTop already at the bottom is a
   *  cheap no-op.
   *
   *  **Also the last route back to follow-bottom.** Every other route
   *  requires the user to move: `idle-reengage` needs a scroll event,
   *  the gesture-end paths need a gesture, and the jump-to-bottom
   *  affordance needs a click. A user parked at the live edge who
   *  touches nothing can fire none of them — and from where they sit
   *  the card already looks pinned, so they have no reason to try. If
   *  follow-bottom is off for them, it is off forever, and every
   *  append silently fails to arrive. That is the shape of two field
   *  reports: a `/commit` receipt row and a `Session compacted` note,
   *  both ordinary appends onto a bottom-parked transcript, both
   *  failing to scroll in.
   *
   *  So content arriving while the scroller sits inside the band
   *  re-engages before pinning. This is not a new principle — it is
   *  the one `shouldAutoPin`'s `isAtBottom` clause already encodes for
   *  the engaged case, where content must not open a gap beneath a
   *  user at the edge. The same reasoning applies when the flag is off
   *  and the position is in the band. It does not depend on knowing
   *  WHY the disengage happened, so it also bounds the cost of any
   *  displacement that lands outside a commit.
   *
   *  Two carve-outs. Never mid-gesture: an in-flight gesture's
   *  re-engagement belongs to `_checkReEngageFollowBottom` at gesture
   *  end, and re-engaging mid-drag would pin under the user's own
   *  thumb. Never while a restore is pending: `setRestoreTarget`
   *  disengaged deliberately and `applyRestoreTarget` owns the
   *  position until it clears — and since engaging calls
   *  `clearRestoreTarget()`, a pin arriving mid-restore would destroy
   *  the cold-boot target outright.
   *
   *  The policy lives here rather than at the call sites because this
   *  method is the single home of the auto-pin gate — which means it
   *  is wider than "growth time" suggests. All five call sites reach
   *  it: the list view's per-cell `ResizeObserver` flush (continuous
   *  during streaming as cells re-wrap), its container `ResizeObserver`
   *  (pane and window resize), its growth pin (the signal the field
   *  cases need), and `TugMarkdownView`'s two. A cell or container
   *  resize while the user sits idle in the band re-engages too. That
   *  is intended: the policy is about the position, not about which
   *  signal happened to ask.
   *
   *  At-bottom is judged twice: against the live geometry AND against
   *  the geometry as of the last delivered scroll event. The live
   *  reading alone has a hole exactly the size of the growth that asks
   *  the question: a whole turn landing in one commit grows the extent
   *  by hundreds of pixels before this gate runs, so the idle user
   *  parked at the old bottom now measures hundreds of pixels "away"
   *  and the recovery net never fires — stranded by the very content
   *  that should have carried them along. The resting reading asks the
   *  right question — was the user at the bottom of everything they
   *  had been shown? — because an idle user's distance from the bottom
   *  only changes when THEY move, and their moves deliver scroll
   *  events that refresh both resting figures. Unseeded resting
   *  geometry (height 0, no scroll event yet) is no evidence and does
   *  not vote. */
