/**
 * file-type-names.ts — what a kind of file is CALLED, in words a person uses.
 *
 * `file-kinds.ts` answers which card a path opens into; this module answers
 * what to call the thing when a surface has to say so out loud. They are
 * separate questions: `.md` and `.rs` open the same card and are not the same
 * kind of file to a reader, while `.png` and `.heic` open the same card and
 * are both, simply, images.
 *
 * A name carries a **key** as well as its words. The key is the bucket a file
 * counts into, so every image extension folds into one "3 Images" rather than
 * scattering into "1 PNG · 1 JPG · 1 HEIC", and `.ts` and `.tsx` are both
 * TypeScript. Counting is the whole reason the key exists — a caller tallying
 * a directory groups on it and then renders {@link countedFileType}.
 *
 * The table is a courtesy, not a closed allowlist: an extension it does not
 * know keeps its own uppercased extension, which is what the user calls that
 * file anyway. Only a file with no extension at all falls back to the card
 * family, and that family is always Text.
 *
