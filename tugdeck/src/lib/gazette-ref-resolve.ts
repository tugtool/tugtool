/**
 * gazette-ref-resolve.ts — is this ref something a click can honestly open?
 *
 * A Gazette ref is a verbatim quote from session activity: a path as the
 * wire spelled it, a sha as the model saw it. Quoting is not existing — the
 * spelling may be relative, differently-cased, or stale — so a ref becomes
 * actionable the way every reference in a transcript does: the annotator's
 * own resolvers confirm it first. A path stats (relative ones against the
 * post's `projectDir`), a bare name asks the project's file index the same
 * question Open Quickly asks, and a sha asks git — whose answer doubles as
 * the file list the diff descriptor wants. Only a confirmed answer yields a
 * payload; everything else is `pending` (an answer is coming, the stores
 * notify) or `inert` with the reason on its tooltip. A link that dead-ends
 * is worse than plain text, here as everywhere.
 *
 * The root is the post's own: tugcast stamps the narrated session's project
 * dir onto the post, and the card holds a browse workspace on it — so a
 * post about a closed session, read days later, still resolves against the
 * repo it was written about. A post with no recorded root resolves only
 * absolute targets; the rest are inert, never guessed.
 *
 * The decision is a pure function of its inputs; the resolver stores are
 * injected with production defaults, which is what the unit tests replace.
 *
