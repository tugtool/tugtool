/**
 * PaneTitleBarItemsStore — the per-card channel for a card to contribute
 * controls to its pane's title bar.
 *
 * This is the generic mechanism behind the `toggleMenu` pane affordance
 * (`pane-model.md`): the title bar's card-contributed controls are NOT
 * lens-specific chrome baked into `TugPane`. Any card publishes its items
 * here; `CardTitleBar` subscribes for the active card and renders them,
 * and nothing when there are none. `tug-pane.tsx` imports only this store —
 * never a card-specific module ([L10]/[L25]).
 *
 * An item says how it wants to be worn. A `"button"` stands in the title
 * bar's control cluster as its own ghost icon button, which is what a verb
 * a card offers *every* time it is open wants — one press, no menu to open
 * first. A `"menu"` item is a row in the shared `…` popup, which is where a
 * verb that is rare, or one of many, belongs; the `…` renders only when at
 * least one such row is published.
 *
 * The exact precedent is `card-title-store.ts`: a card publishes into a
 * per-card store, the pane subscribes and renders — no card coupling in
 * the chrome. Icons follow that store's rule too: a lucide icon NAME, which
 * the chrome resolves, so no component travels this channel.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] subscribable store consumed via `useSyncExternalStore`;
 * [L10]/[L25] chrome and content stay in their lanes with this store as
 * the channel; [L24] structure-zone state across the pane/card boundary.
 *

/**
 * A single title-bar item a card contributes — a COMMAND REFERENCE, not a
 * label and a callback.
 *
 * An item is a command ([L30] names one first in its list), so a card says
 * only *which* commands belong on its pane's title bar, in what order, and
 * in which of the two shapes. `CardTitleBar` resolves the item's title, its
 * enablement, and its shortcut glyph from `command-registry.ts` and invokes
 * it with `dispatchCommand`, so an item can never disagree with the same
 * command's chord or its item in the native menu bar.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `disabled` field. Enablement is the registry's
 * answer via `validate(chain)`; a card-supplied one would be the second
 * opinion the law forbids, and it would drift from ⌘S the first time a gate
 * changed. What the card decides is MEMBERSHIP — whether the item is in the
 * title bar at all — which is a different question and genuinely the card's.
