/**
 * use-text-card-settings.ts — one Text card's editor settings: read
 * the resolved values, and write them back when the gear popup changes
 * one.
 *
 * Default-then-card-local:
 *
 *   - Per-card values persist at `dev.text-card/<cardId>` and always
 *     win once present.
 *   - The deck-wide defaults at `dev.tugtool.text-card/settings` apply
 *     to any card with nothing of its own.
 *   - There is NO mount-time write. A card resolves `persisted ??
 *     defaults ?? built-in` live, so an untouched card follows the deck
 *     defaults (even if the user edits them in Settings while it is
 *     open) and leaves no per-card tugbank entry to accumulate. The
 *     FIRST gear change snapshots the full current settings into the
 *     card's own slot, and from then on the card owns them — "settings
 *     apply when the file is opened; once tuned, the card owns them."
 *
 * This deliberately does NOT pin on mount (an earlier version did): that
 * both leaked a per-card blob for every card ever opened and could pin
 * hardcoded defaults if the deck-defaults frame had not yet cached at
 * mount. Resolving live avoids both.
 *
 * Pure tugbank state — no IPC, no session round-trip. Writing a setting
 * is an optimistic local-cache write plus a fire-and-forget PUT.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] both reads enter through `useTugbankValue`
 * (useSyncExternalStore); no localStorage — persistence is tugbank only.
