/**
 * open-file-in-card.ts — the one implementation behind every
 * "open this path" entry point.
 *
 * The path's kind decides the card family: text goes to a Text card, and
 * everything `file-kinds.ts` classifies as viewable (images, PDFs) goes to a
 * read-only `file-view` card. Branching here means every producer — ⌘O, Open
 * Recent, Open Quickly, Finder, transcript links, context menus — inherits the
 * routing without knowing it exists. Both families share the reuse and
 * open-target semantics below; a viewer just has no lines to reveal and is
 * never dirty.
 *
 * Path-keyed reuse: a Text card already bound to `path` is activated
 * (raised + focus-claimed via `transferFocusForActivation`, so the
 * keystroke/click taxonomy matches every other activation route) and
 * jumped to `line`. Otherwise the file gets a fresh card of its own,
 * seeded through `addCard`'s initial-content channel — it mounts
 * directly onto the file via the same restore path a reloaded card
 * takes. Under a multi-slot arrangement that fresh card opens at the slot
 * beside the card the open came from ({@link neighborSlot}).
 *
 * Callers: the `open-file` registry handler (Control frames +
 * `dispatchCommand` from transcript links) and DeckCanvas's
 * `TUG_ACTIONS.OPEN_FILE` chain handler (context-menu items).
 *
 * @module lib/open-file-in-card
