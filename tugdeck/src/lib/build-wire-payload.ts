/**
 * `build-wire-payload` — pure flattening of the substrate's
 * `(text, atoms)` pair into Anthropic-API-shaped `ContentBlock[]`,
 * paired with a resolver mapping image-block index → originating atom
 * id.
 *
 * ## What this module does
 *
 * The substrate stores user input in two parallel halves: a string
 * with `U+FFFC` (object replacement character) placeholders at every
 * atom position, and a parallel `AtomSegment[]` whose entries carry
 * the chip data. The substrate keeps both halves because the
 * editor's chip renderer walks `text` looking for `U+FFFC` and reads
 * the corresponding atom for placement — substituting in the
 * substrate would erase the chip-position information.
 *
 * The wire, by contrast, is Anthropic's content-block array: an
 * ordered sequence of `{ type: "text", text }` and
 * `{ type: "image", source }` blocks. To preserve image-atom
 * **positions** through JSONL round-trip (Anthropic records `messages`
 * verbatim), this builder emits **interleaved** blocks rather than
 * flattening all images into a leading attachment list. The shape
 * lands in claude's JSONL unchanged; restoring an interleaved
 * sequence reconstitutes which slots in the message were image atoms
 * without any side-channel substrate journaling.
 *
 * Per [Step 5c](roadmap/tide-atoms.md#step-5c) and
 * [Spec S03](roadmap/tide-atoms.md#s03-build-wire-payload) (revised).
 *
 * ## Atom-to-wire mapping
 *
 * The discriminator is **bytes in the store, not atom type**: any
 * atom whose `id` resolves to a bytes-store entry emits a standalone
 * `image` block at its position; all other atoms substitute their
 * `value` into the surrounding text block.
 *
 *  - `image` + id + bytes (drop / paste of an image) → standalone
 *    `image` content block at the atom's position. The surrounding
 *    text blocks have the atom's `U+FFFC` removed.
 *  - `file` / `doc` (no id — `@`-completion of a workspace path) →
 *    `atom.value` substituted into the current text block. Claude's
 *    `Read` tool fetches the path on demand.
 *  - `file` + id + bytes (drop of a `.md` / source file from Finder) →
 *    today: same as the no-id case — substitute the label / path into
 *    text. (Inline text-file attachments rode the legacy `Attachment`
 *    `text/*` shape; the content-block wire doesn't carry a parallel
 *    `text-file` source. We can revisit if a need arises.)
 *  - `image` (no id; defensive) → substituted text only.
 *  - `link` → substituted text (the URL).
 *  - `command` → substituted text (the command name).
 *
 * ## Returned `atomIdAt` resolver
 *
 * The walk that produces blocks also tracks which atoms became image
 * blocks (atoms with bytes in the store) and in what order. The
 * returned `atomIdAt(imageBlockIndex)` is a closure over that
 * mapping; passing it to `synthesizeUserMessageFromBlocks` ensures
 * the synthesized substrate's atoms reuse the editor's original atom
 * ids — bytes-store entries from drop / paste stay live across the
 * submit boundary instead of orphaning under fresh UUIDs.
 *
 * The resolver returns `undefined` for any index outside the
 * emitted image-block range (defensive against caller bugs).
 *
 * ## Invariants per [Spec S03] (revised)
 *
 *  - **Pure on inputs.** The bytes-store is read-only here; mutations
 *    live in the drop / paste / synthesizer paths. Same inputs always
 *    yield the same `(content, atomIdAt)` pair.
 *  - **No `U+FFFC` in any text block** when `atoms.length` matches
 *    `count(U+FFFC, text)`. The substrate maintains this on every
 *    state mutation; we walk in lockstep.
 *  - **Defensive on count mismatch.** If `atoms.length <
 *    count(U+FFFC, text)`, extra `U+FFFC` chars pass through into the
 *    current text block (visible-regression rather than crash).
 *  - **Adjacent text segments coalesce.** A walk over alternating
 *    text + atom produces one text block per contiguous text run —
 *    consecutive image atoms emit consecutive image blocks with no
 *    empty text block between them; an image at the start or end of
 *    text doesn't generate an empty surrounding text block.
 *  - **Silent skip on missing bytes.** An image atom whose id is not
 *    in the store contributes only its substituted text to the
 *    current text block — no image block, and `atomIdAt` doesn't
 *    count this position.
 *
 * ## Why this lives outside the reducer
 *
 * The reducer is pure with no side effects. The bytes-store IS
 * external state — looking up bytes by id is a side-effecting read.
 * Doing the read here, in the impure store wrapper
 * (`CodeSessionStore.send`), keeps the reducer pure.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] — bytes-store is external state, not React-observable.
 *       [L07] — `code-session-store.send` reads the live store at the
 *       moment of dispatch. [L19] — file structure / docstring
 *       discipline.
