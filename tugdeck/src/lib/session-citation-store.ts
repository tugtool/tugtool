/**
 * session-citation-store.ts — does the ledger hold the session this citation
 * names? ([D132])
 *
 * A citation surface — a History commit row, a Gazette ref, the Changes card's
 * orphan hint — holds an id and nothing else, and it has one question to answer
 * before it can render: is that session *findable*? The answer decides between
 * the session atom and [P13]'s slashed inert one, and it must be a fact about
 * the reference rather than a fact about this run. Answered from the client's
 * own caches it is neither: `sessionTagStore` knows only the sessions some
 * listing, push, or binding happened to mention, so the same commit's chip would
 * be resolvable or slashed depending on whether the picker had been opened.
 *
 * So the ledger answers, over the `resolve_sessions` CONTROL verb, and this
 * store is the cache in front of it:
 *
 * 1. **Ask once per id, in batches.** A History card mounts a hundred rows in
 *    one frame; they queue on a microtask and go out as one request. An id
 *    already asked or already answered is never re-asked.
 * 2. **Cache both answers.** A hit records the full id and the row's own facts;
 *    a miss records the miss. Caching the negative is the whole reason the
 *    server names its misses — without it every repaint would re-ask for a
 *    session that will never exist here.
 * 3. **Seed the identity stores from the answer.** A resolved row carries the
 *    ledger's name, callsign and description, so this is a fourth seed path
 *    beside the spawn ack, `list_sessions_ok` and the card-binding rows. That is
 *    what makes `resolveSessionIdentity` able to speak for a session no card is
 *    bound to and no listing covered.
 * 4. **Forget on reconnect.** A wire bounce may have crossed a spawn or a trash,
 *    and a cached miss outliving the session it missed is the one wrong answer
 *    this store could hold for a long time.
 *
 * **The short id is expanded server-side.** A citation records eight hex chars;
 * the answer is keyed by what was asked, so `resolve(queried)` hands back the
 * *full* id the atom, the clipboard flavors and the raise gesture all need. The
 * client deliberately does not try prefix-matching its own caches: the ledger
 * can see every session and detect an ambiguous prefix, and a cache cannot do
 * either.
 *
 * **Laws:** [L02] — components read this through {@link useCitedSession}, which
 * subscribes; the ask fires from an effect, never from a render body. [L27] —
 * the reconnect observer's unregister is held and released by `dispose()`.
 *
