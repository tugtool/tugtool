/**
 * landing-mode — the one interface the composer reads to drive a landing
 * ([P01]).
 *
 * A landing mode owns the prompt entry's whole document: the editor holds a
 * message, Z5 swaps to cancel / auto-message / land, and the composer's own
 * prompt draft is set aside until the mode exits. Commit mode was the first;
 * join mode is the second. Because the composer holds exactly one document, at
 * most one landing mode can be active — and one `landingMode` slot on
 * `TugPromptEntry` makes that structural rather than a rule two controllers
 * each have to remember.
 *
 * The interface is extracted from `CommitModeController`'s shipped public
 * shape rather than designed fresh, so the commit surface conforms with no
 * change to its behavior and its test file stays the regression net.
 *
 * @module lib/landing-mode
