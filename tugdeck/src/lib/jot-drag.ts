/**
 * Native HTML5 drag of a Lens jot into the Session card's prompt entry
 * ([P04]/[P05]).
 *
 * The drag is the platform's own: the row's incipit is `draggable`, the payload
 * rides on the `DataTransfer` under a private MIME type (plus `text/plain` so a
 * jot also drops into any other text surface), and the drag image is the
 * OS-rendered snapshot of the dragged element. Escape mid-drag is therefore
 * handled by AppKit — it cancels the session and animates the drag image back
 * to the row it came from — and the drop target paints the same accept ring and
 * drop caret an image drag paints, because the prompt entry accepts both drags
 * through one set of `dragover` / `drop` handlers.
