/**
 * clipboard-origin — which project was this text read against?
 *
 * Prose cites files the way people talk about them: `tugdeck/src/x.css:12`,
 * relative to a root the sentence never names because everyone reading it in
 * place already knows which one. Copy that sentence somewhere else and the
 * citation stops resolving — nothing was lost, the root was simply never
 * written down. So a Tug copy writes it down, in the clipboard sidecar's
 * `origins`, and a destination that keeps the text keeps the root with it.
 *
 * **Why a DOM attribute and not a prop.** A copy can leave a card by many
 * doors: ⌘C through the surface's own `copy` handler, a block's Copy button,
 * a context-menu item, Edit ▸ Copy as Plain Text reading the live selection
 * from a menu with no React context in sight. Threading an origin prop to
 * every one of them means every intermediate component forwarding something it
 * does not care about — the same plumbing failure the annotator's own
 * {@link AnnotationScope} exists to avoid, and the reason tool headers went
 * unannotated for so long. An attribute on the surface is visible to all of
 * them from the node they already have: the copy's target, the button's
 * element, the selection's anchor. {@link clipboardOriginFor} walks up.
 *
 * **Nesting is the point, not a hazard.** `closest()` finds the NEAREST
 * stamp, so a surface inside a surface wins for its own subtree — a Gazette
 * post narrating a different project than the card around it stamps itself and
 * is correct without anyone coordinating.
 *
 * A surface with no project stamps nothing, and a copy from it carries no
 * provenance. That leaves the destination exactly as well off as it was before
 * any of this existed, which is the right failure.
 *
