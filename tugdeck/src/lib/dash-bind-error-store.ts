/**
 * dash-bind-error-store.ts — the last refused dash binding, per session.
 *
 * `bind_dash` is a broadcast verb: the deck sends a CONTROL frame and the
 * answer comes back through `action-dispatch`, nowhere near the card that
 * asked. Success needs no channel — `bind_dash_ok` moves the binding store and
 * the chip and the lane follow. A refusal has nothing to move, so without this
 * it lands in silence and a `/dash <name>` that did nothing is
 * indistinguishable from one that was never typed.
 *
 * So the failure is parked here, keyed by session, and the card's
 * {@link DashBindErrorNoticeController} turns it into a pane bulletin — the
 * same shape `ChangesetVerbStore` + `ClaimErrorNoticeController` use, for the
 * same reason ([L22]: a bulletin is a direct DOM update and must not
 * round-trip through render).
 *
