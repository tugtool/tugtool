/**
 * resting-line.ts — what the PULSE's activity level says when the session
 * is not saying anything.
 *
 * A session at rest has two ways of getting there, and they are different
 * readings:
 *
 *  - it finished a turn. The voice's last beat is the bare marker `Done`
 *    ({@link TURN_DONE_MARKER}, written by `tugcode/src/pulse/voice.ts`'s
 *    `onTurnEnd`), which is a good wire marker and a poor thing to read off
 *    a rail — it says the run ended and nothing about when, and it sits
 *    there unchanged for however long the session stays quiet.
 *  - it has never spoken at all. Nothing has happened since it was made.
 *
 * Both become a sentence with a date and a time in it and the same closing
 * word: `Completed at Jul 30, 7:15 PM. Ready.` / `Created at Jun 17, 6:11 AM.
 * Ready.` The stamp is what turns a stale-looking line into a fact — a row
 * that says `Done` reads the same after five seconds and five hours — and
 * `Ready.` is what the state actually is, said in the same breath.
 *
 * The DAY is always there, never dropped for a timestamp that happens to be
 * today's. A rail of resting rows is read by comparing them to each other, and
 * a column where some rows carry a day and some do not is a column the eye has
 * to sort before it can compare — and the one row that stayed short is exactly
 * the one whose day the reader then has to infer.
 *

 * asked for in one call: a single `toLocaleString` for both writes its own
