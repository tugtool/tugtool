/**
 * beat-file-target — recognize the file target inside a pulse beat.
 *
 * The voice narrates file tools in a fixed grammar — `Reading <path>`,
 * `Writing <path> — 37 lines`, `Editing <path>…`, optionally prefixed with a
 * subagent label (`Explore · Reading <path>`) — and carries the path WHOLE on
 * the wire, absolute when the session's root could not account for it. The
 * deck's surfaces do not show that path as text: a file is shown as a file
 * reference — glyph + basename, full path on hover — and this module is the
 * one grammar that says where the path sits in the beat so every surface
 * splits it identically.
 *
 * Recognition is deliberately narrow. Only the three file verbs match, the
 * candidate must be a single whitespace-free token, and it must actually read
 * as a path — a `/` somewhere, or a dotted file suffix. A monologue sentence
 * that happens to open "Reading the docs." fails both gates and renders as
 * the prose it is.
 *
