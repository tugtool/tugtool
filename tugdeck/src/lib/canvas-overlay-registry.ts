/**
 * Canvas overlay registry — maps the (single) canvas-level overlay root
 * to the `HTMLElement` mounted by `<CanvasOverlayRoot />`. The portal
 * target hook (`use-canvas-overlay.ts`) reads from this registry; the
 * root component registers and unregisters itself in a `useLayoutEffect`.
 *
 * The registry is module-level (not React state). It is appearance-zone
 * infrastructure that lives outside the React render tree (L22): React
 * components opt in via `useSyncExternalStore` against `subscribe`.
 *
 * ## Single-root invariant
 *
 * Today there is exactly one `<DeckCanvas />` per tab and therefore
 * exactly one overlay root. The registry stores a single element,
 * not a keyed map. A second `register()` call replaces the previous
 * registration and emits a dev-mode warning — useful for catching
 * "two `<CanvasOverlayRoot />` components mounted accidentally" but
 * also benign during HMR (Vite may briefly mount a replacement before
 * unmounting the old one). Production code never observes the warning.
 *
 * ## Multi-deck promotion path
 *
 * When a future multi-deck UI lands, this module promotes from a single
 * root to a `Map<deckId, HTMLElement>` keyed by deck id. Consumers who
 * subscribe through `useCanvasOverlay` already pass through a hook that
 * can grow a `deckId` parameter — the migration is local. Today's
 * single-root API is the right shape until that day; speculative
 * generalization is its own bug.
 *
 * ## Notify contract
 *
 * `register` and `unregister` both call `notify()` synchronously in
 * the same tick as the mutation. Every listener runs before control
 * returns to the caller. `useSyncExternalStore` consumers therefore
 * observe the new root inside the same commit cycle that registered
 * it — no microtask deferral, no batched callback. This mirrors
 * `pane-content-registry`'s contract for the same reason: a delayed
 * notify would open a window where a portal could attach to a stale
 * (or null) root.
 *
