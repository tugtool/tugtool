/**
 * gazette-measure.ts — the Gazette rail's widths, derived from its type.
 *
 * The Gazette's widths are DERIVED FROM ITS TYPE, not chosen as pixel counts.
 * A post is prose, and prose wants a measure: 64 characters by default,
 * fungible down to 52 before the column stops reading as prose. Those two
 * numbers are two of the widths the space allocator takes for a rail — its
 * preference and its comfort floor ({@link lib/layout-imposer!RailPolicy}) —
 * so the typography defines the policy directly, with no new mechanism
 * between them. The third, the hard floor, is not a typographic number at
 * all: it is the width below which the card stops painting, and it is what the
 * user's own resize drag may reach.
 *
 * {@link GAZETTE_BODY_CH_PX} and {@link GAZETTE_ROW_CHROME_PX} are AUTHORED
 * constants, measured once against the real render and pinned by at0365,
 * rather than measured here at boot. Registration runs before layout has
 * requested the face, so `document.fonts` would answer for the fallback with
 * complete confidence (the trap `lib/font-metrics.ts` documents), and a width
 * that upgraded itself asynchronously mid-session would be a re-tune trigger
 * the allocator's moments do not include. The pin closes the drift loop
 * instead: retune the CSS and the test hands back the numbers to author here.
 *
 * A leaf module for the reason `gazette-card-id.ts` is one — the app-test that
 * pins these numbers must read them without dragging the card's whole React
 * graph (and its CSS import) into its module graph.
 *
 * @module lib/gazette-measure
