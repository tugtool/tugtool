/**
 * session-identity.ts — the one place Tug decides what a session is called.
 *
 * Tug used to name a session five different ways: a chip rule, a chooser-row
 * rule, a Lens-entry hash sniff, a title-bar composer, and the Rust feed's own
 * precedence. No two agreed. This module is [D123] ("a pane's name is one
 * string produced in one place") applied to the session: one resolver produces
 * one structured {@link SessionIdentity} record, and every surface renders that
 * record at a declared density tier.
 *
 * Three entry points, and which one you want is not a matter of taste:
 *
 *  - {@link useSessionIdentity} — **the React entry point.** It subscribes to
 *    each backing store *by id* and then derives. Every component uses this.
 *  - {@link resolveSessionIdentity} — an imperative SNAPSHOT with no
 *    subscription. Correct only for non-React callers: clipboard writes,
 *    export filenames, command routes, list projections that already carry
 *    the stores' version tokens as inputs.
 *  - {@link sessionIdentityLine} / {@link sessionCitation} — pure formatters
 *    over a resolved record.
 *
 * **Calling the bare resolver from a render is the bug this module exists to
 * prevent.** It reads three stores imperatively; from a render body it hands
 * back a snapshot with no subscription, so a `/rename` or a synopsis write
 * updates the stores while the surface repaints never. That failure passes
 * every unit test and shows up only as a stale name in the running app, which
 * is why "no component calls `resolveSessionIdentity`" is a grep gate rather
 * than a convention.
 *
 * **Liveness is not identity.** The record carries no phase field. Phase lives
 * on a per-*card* `codeSessionStore` — there is no session-keyed phase store to
 * read, and folding one in would wake every identity surface on every
 * transcript event. The phase dot stays a `cardId`-keyed leaf subscription
 * composed *into* the row and masthead tiers as a child; identity and liveness
 * are two subscriptions with two keys that meet in the component.
 *
 * **The branch is not identity either.** It is telemetry — it rides the record
 * for the masthead's placard and never appears in a rendered name. The old
 * `(<branch>)` title suffix is retired.
 *
 * **Resolvability is a field, not an inference from `tag`.** A citation may name
 * a session this ledger has never held, and the honest rendering still shows the
 * callsign that citation recorded ([P13]) — so `tag` alone cannot answer "can
 * this be found", and {@link SessionIdentity.resolved} does. Whether the ledger
 * holds a cited session is asked over the wire by
 * `session-citation-store.ts`; this module only records the answer.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] external state enters React through `useSyncExternalStore` only.
