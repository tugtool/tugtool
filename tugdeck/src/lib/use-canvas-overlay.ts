/**
 * useCanvasOverlay — portal-target hook for canvas-level overlays.
 *
 * Returns the currently-registered `<CanvasOverlayRoot />` element so
 * a popup-class consumer can `createPortal(content, useCanvasOverlay())`.
 * When no root is registered (the brief window during initial deck
 * mount, or any host that mounts a substrate outside a `DeckCanvas` —
 * unit tests, future standalone harnesses), the hook falls back to
 * `document.body`. The fallback path is invisible in production and
 * keeps standalone consumers working without forcing them to mount
 * the deck infrastructure just to use a substrate that opens an
 * overlay.
 *
 * ## Why lib, not chrome
 *
 * The hook is a service consumed by substrates (`tug-text-editor`'s
 * `CompletionOverlay`, eventually any popup-class primitive). Substrates
 * import from `lib/` by convention; importing from `chrome/` would
 * invert the layering. The root component itself stays in `chrome/`
 * because it is a deck-level chrome concern that gets composed into
 * `<DeckCanvas />`.
 *
 * ## Reactivity
 *
 * Subscribes via `useSyncExternalStore` against the registry, so a
 * consumer re-renders if the registered root changes. In practice
 * the root is registered once at deck mount and never replaced, but
 * during HMR or in tests that register multiple roots in sequence,
 * portals re-target on the next render.
 *
