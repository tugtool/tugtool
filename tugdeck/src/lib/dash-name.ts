/**
 * dash-name.ts — what the deck will pass through to `tugutil dash create`.
 *
 * `/dash <name>` runs its create path through the card's shell route, which
 * means the name lands on a command line. This is the conservative check that
 * decides whether it goes unquoted or gets refused with a sentence naming the
 * constraint — a name with a space, a quote, or a `$` in it is answered here
 * rather than turned into a shell-quoting adventure.
 *
 * Deliberately narrower than the CLI's own rule and deliberately not a
 * substitute for it: `tugutil` remains the real validator, and a name that
 * passes here can still be refused there for reasons the deck has no business
 * knowing (a taken branch, a reserved word). What this guarantees is only that
 * whatever passes is safe to concatenate.
