/**
 * copy-text — write text to the clipboard with the project it came from.
 *
 * The plain `navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)` scattered across the copy
 * affordances is correct about the text and silent about everything else. For
 * a short identifier — a commit hash, a session id, a timestamp — silent is
 * right: there is no relative path in a sha, and nothing a root would help
 * resolve later. For PROSE it is a small loss every time. A copied paragraph
 * cites `tugdeck/src/x.css:12`, and the root that makes that a file rather
 * than a string is knowable at the moment of the copy and unknowable after.
 *
 * So the surfaces that copy prose call this instead, handing it a node — the
 * button, the block, the view — and {@link clipboardOriginFor} walks up to
 * whichever surface stamped its project. Nothing above the node stamps one and
 * this degrades exactly into the `writeText` it replaced.
 *
 * The provenance can only ride the native bridge: WebKit's pasteboard
 * normalization swallows custom MIME types, which is why the bridge exists at
 * all (see `tug-native-clipboard.ts`). Outside Tug.app there is no bridge and
 * no sidecar — browser-mode development copies text and nothing else.
 *
 * @module lib/copy-text
