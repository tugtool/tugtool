/**
 * atom-mention-marker — wire-text marker syntax for non-image atom
 * mentions.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Non-image atoms (file paths, doc references, URLs, commands the
 * user inserted via `@`-completion in the editor) are flattened
 * into a `text` content block at submit time per [Spec S03] /
 * [D01]. The substrate `U+FFFC` placeholder doesn't survive — the
 * model sees real text, not a placeholder.
 *
 * The original choice was to substitute the atom's bare `value`
 * (`"ga.txt"`) into the text. That made the prompt read naturally
 * to the model but lost the atom's structural identity: the JSONL
 * has no way to know "this token was a mention." On replay the
 * transcript shows `ga.txt` as plain prose, not a chip — visible
 * regression vs. what the user typed.
 *
 * The current marker wraps the value in backticks with a leading
 * `@`: `` `@ga.txt` ``. Two properties matter:
 *
 *   1. **Round-trippable.** The marker survives in JSONL verbatim
 *      and can be parsed back to recover atom positions and
 *      values. On replay the substrate synthesis re-mints chips at
 *      the original positions.
 *   2. **Model-friendly.** Backticked tokens are how Claude already
 *      reads "code-like reference" in prompts; the `@` prefix adds
 *      "user-mentioned this." The combination is unambiguous to the
 *      model and matches conventions in Markdown / `@`-mention UX
 *      elsewhere.
 *
 * Markdown's code-span syntax doesn't disambiguate against literal
 * backticks in user prose either — a user who types
 * `` `@foo` `` in their text literally would get a chip on replay
 * even if no atom was inserted. Acceptable false positive (visible
 * regression, never data loss); raising the bar with escape
 * sequences would complicate the model's reading.
 *
 * ## Backtick-in-value fallback
 *
 * If an atom's `value` contains a backtick (rare — file paths,
 * URLs, commands don't normally have them), the wrap would produce
 * a broken marker. {@link wrapAtomMention} falls back to
 * plain-text substitution in that case — the round-trip is lossy
 * for that one atom, matching the original pre-marker behaviour.
 *
