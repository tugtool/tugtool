/**
 * host-facts-store — the facts tugcast publishes about the machine it
 * runs on: the network `hostname` and the login shell's name.
 *
 * The browser cannot know the backend's real hostname or `$SHELL`
 * (`window.location.hostname` is only the URL host), so tugcast resolves
 * them and serves them at `GET /api/host` (Spec S01). Host facts are
 * static for a server's lifetime — this store fetches them exactly once
 * and caches the result.
 *
 * The store starts empty and resolves asynchronously; a failed fetch
 * leaves it empty. Consumers treat an empty (`null`) snapshot as "not
 * yet known" and render nothing for the affected route ([D04]).
 *
 * Reads enter React through `useSyncExternalStore` only — [L02].

 * is valid: that is what the endpoint sends when `$SHELL` is unset.
 *
 * `shellPath` is treated as additive: when the server omits it (older
 * tugcast that predates the field), the parser falls back to the empty
 * string so the snapshot is well-formed. The Shell-route indicator
 * badge falls back to `shell` then to a `shell` placeholder, so a
