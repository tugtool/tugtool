/**
 * gazette-body-segments.ts — does the prose already name this ref?
 *
 * A Gazette post carries refs the model listed beside its prose. Those two
 * are written independently, so they overlap only by accident: a post can
 * mention three files and list a fourth. The prose's own mentions are
 * atomized by the **content annotator** — the same pass that marks paths
 * and shas anywhere else in the app — which scans the text and needs no
 * ref list at all. What the ref list is still good for is the remainder:
 * provenance the sentence never got around to naming, shown as trailing
 * chips.
 *
 * This module is the filter between the two, and nothing more. It answers
 * one question — *is this ref already in the prose?* — so a ref the reader
 * can already see and click in the sentence does not also appear as a chip
 * underneath it. (An earlier version of this file tried to do the placing
 * as well, matching ref targets against the body and rendering the hits
 * inline. That is why mentions the ref list happened not to contain stayed
 * dead text: the matcher could only ever find what the model had listed.
 * The annotator finds them all, so the placing is gone and only the
 * suppression is left.)
 *
 * Matching is deliberately generous, because a near-miss here costs a
 * duplicate chip rather than a lost link: a file ref counts as mentioned
 * when the body contains its full target *or* its basename, and a commit
 * ref when the body holds a hex run that is a prefix of its sha or that it
 * is a prefix of — the two spell the same commit at different lengths.
 * Boundaries are checked so `foo.ts` is not claimed by `other/foo.ts` or
 * by `foo.ts.bak`. A session ref is never suppressed: its citation is a
 * different surface with a different gesture, not a duplicate of anything
 * in the prose.
 *
 * Pure.
