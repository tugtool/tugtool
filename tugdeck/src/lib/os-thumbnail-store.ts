/**
 * os-thumbnail-store — QuickLook thumbnails for the attachments that have no
 * pixels of their own.
 *
 * An image attachment paints itself. A `.txt`, a `.pdf`, a `.key`, a `.zip`
 * cannot, and a generic document glyph says nothing about *which* file it is —
 * which is exactly what a preview strip exists to answer. macOS already knows
 * how to draw all of these, and QuickLook is the only way to ask: the thumbnail
 * is rendered by the owning app's extension, out of process. Nothing in the web
 * layer can reach that, so the request goes through the host bridge
 * (`thumbnailPath` in `tugapp/Sources/MainWindow.swift`).
 *
 * ## Why a store rather than an effect in the tile
 *
 * The answer arrives asynchronously and outlives the component that asked for
 * it — a strip re-renders on every keystroke that touches a link, and a tile
 * that re-requested its thumbnail each time would round-trip to a QuickLook
 * extension per keystroke. So the result is cached here, keyed by path, and
 * read through `useSyncExternalStore` ([L02]) like every other external state.
 * A path is requested at most once per session; the entry it settles into is
 * what every later mount reads.
 *
 * A path with no thumbnail settles to `null` and stays there. That is a real
 * answer, not a pending one — the tile falls back to its glyph and never asks
 * again.
 *
