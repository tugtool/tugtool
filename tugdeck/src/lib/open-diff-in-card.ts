/**
 * open-diff-in-card.ts — the one implementation behind "pop this diff out
 * into its own card" ([P20]).
 *
 * Descriptor-keyed reuse (the mirror of `open-file-in-card.ts`'s path-keyed
 * reuse): opening a descriptor already shown by a Diff card activates that
 * card (raised + focus-claimed via `transferFocusForActivation`, so the
 * activation taxonomy matches every other route) and re-points it; otherwise
 * a fresh Diff card is created seeded with the descriptor through `addCard`'s
 * initial-content channel. Two cards showing the same diff would be pure
 * duplication.
 *
 * Placement and the flash are the file opener's, for the same reason: a diff
 * popped out of a changeset row belongs beside the card the row is in
 * ({@link neighborSlot}), and the card that answers announces itself
 * ({@link flashCardPane}) — including when it is a card that already existed
 * and merely raised, which otherwise gives no sign the pop-out did anything.
 *
 * Callers: the `open-diff` registry handler (`dispatchCommand` from the
 * changeset card's pop-out affordances).
 *
