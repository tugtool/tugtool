/**
 * frontmost-project.ts — the project Open Quickly should search.
 *
 * A "project" is a bound session-card session, whose binding carries the
 * `projectDir` (the absolute workspace root — FILETREE indexes paths
 * relative to it) and the `workspaceKey` (which scopes the FILETREE feed).
 * Open Quickly picks the **most-frontmost** such project: walking the deck
 * front-to-back (topmost pane's active card first), it returns the first
 * card that has a binding — so as long as any session card has a project open,
 * that's very likely the one the user means, and Open Quickly stays live.
 * When no card is bound, the result is `null` and Open Quickly is disabled.
 *
