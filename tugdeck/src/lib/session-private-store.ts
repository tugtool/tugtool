/**
 * session-private-store.ts — per-session Gazette-privacy cache.
 *
 * `sessions.private` lives authoritatively in tugcast's ledger. The `/private`
 * command needs to know the current value to toggle it, and the session atom
 * needs it to show the resting state — so this store indexes
 * `tugSessionId → private` and each surface subscribes by id ([L02]).
 *
 * Three arms fill it, and between them a card is never left guessing: the
 * `spawn_session_ok` bind ack (which is how a card reloaded or resumed
 * mid-turn learns the flag without waiting for a later frame), the
 * `session_updated` push, and `/private`'s own ack. The flag also rides
 * `list_sessions_ok` rows on the wire, but nothing reads it there — the picker
 * shows no marker, and a listing is about sessions this deck may not be
 * holding.
 *
 * Privacy is a **resting state**, which is why it gets a store rather than
 * living in the ack: a transient "this session is now private" notice is gone
 * after a reload, and a session silently not being narrated with nothing on
 * screen to say why is precisely the resting lie this codebase refuses.
 *
 * The value is authoritative on every push — a row carrying `false` means the
 * session really is public — so there is no non-clobbering seed arm here. The
 * `/private` command writes optimistically so the marker turns over with the
 * gesture rather than a round trip later.
 *
 * Alongside the state, the store carries the **transition**: a one-shot
 * {@link SessionPrivateStore.awaitSettle} waiter the `/private` command arms
 * before it sends, resolved by whichever ack comes back. The marker can afford
 * to be optimistic because it is reconciled either way; the bulletin cannot,
 * because a claim that the Gazette has stopped listening is not something to
 * make on a request that may still be refused. A session is bound to exactly
 * one card (`card_id` is 1:1 on the ledger row), so the session id addresses
 * the waiter as precisely as a card id would.
