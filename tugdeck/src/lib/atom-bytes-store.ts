/**
 * `atom-bytes-store` — per-dev-card side-table of base64 bytes for
 * inline image atoms (drop / paste).
 *
 * ## What lives here, and why a separate store
 *
 * The substrate's `AtomSegment` carries display data only — `kind`,
 * `type`, `label`, `value`, and (post-Step 2) an optional `id`. It
 * does *not* carry the underlying image bytes. Storing 5 MB of base64
 * on `AtomSegment.value` would balloon every state-preservation
 * snapshot, every CASE-A interrupt restore, every undo history entry.
 *
 * This module is the side-table. Keyed by atom id (a UUID minted at
 * drop / paste time), it holds the post-downsample base64 bytes + the
 * effective media type. Atoms remain lightweight; the bytes-store is
 * the single source of truth for image-attachment payload bytes
 * between insert and turn-commit, and between turn-commit and
 * card-unmount (the JSON-serializable snapshot rides
 * `useCardStatePreservation`).
 *
 * ## Lifetimes
 *
 * One instance per `CodeSessionStore` (per-dev-card scope). The
 * store is created in the `CodeSessionStore` constructor and disposed
 * when the store is disposed. Entries live from `put()` until
 * `delete()` or store disposal; state preservation (`snapshot()` →
 * `restore()`) round-trips the map across HMR / pane restore / cold
 * boot.
 *
 * Why per-card and not per-session: a single Tug session can host
 * multiple cards (the dev card surface is the primary one but
 * future cards may attach the same session). Each card has its own
 * editor and drop / paste affordances, so each card's bytes are
 * scoped to its own store. This keeps cross-card paste of identities
 * a clean separate question (currently out of scope per the
 * non-goals).
 *
 * ## Why a class, not a Map directly
 *
 * Three reasons. First, [Spec S02] mandates a contract (`put`, `get`,
 * `delete`, `snapshot`, `restore`); the class gives us a stable
 * shape for that contract. Second, `restore` is not just `Object.assign`
 * — we want to be explicit about merge semantics (additive on existing
 * keys, see below). Third, the consumer surface (drop extension,
 * paste handler, reducer commit path, state preservation) is wider
 * than just "stick a Map somewhere"; a named factory clarifies the
 * intent at the call site.
 *
 * ## Pure-logic, no DOM
 *
 * This file has no DOM, no React, no canvas, no async. It is data
 * plumbing. Tested as a pure module in `__tests__/atom-bytes-store.test.ts`.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L02] external state — this store IS external state from React's
 *    perspective. Consumers do not subscribe to it through
 *    `useSyncExternalStore` because no rendering depends on its
 *    contents (the substrate's atom array drives rendering;
 *    bytes-store reads happen at submit / commit time only, off the
 *    render path).
 *  - [L19] file structure / docstring discipline.
 *  - [L23] state preservation — the `snapshot` / `restore` methods
 *    are the bytes-store's contribution to the [A9] protocol so user
 *    state survives cold boot / pane restore / HMR.
 *
 * References:
 *  - [Spec S02] AtomBytesStore interface — `roadmap/dev-atoms.md#s02-atom-bytes-store`
 *  - [D03] per-card bytes-store keyed by UUID — `roadmap/dev-atoms.md#d03-atom-bytes-store`
 *  - [D04] no raw bytes on the React snapshot — `roadmap/dev-atoms.md#d04-no-bytes-on-snapshot`
