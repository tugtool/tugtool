/**
 * model-domains.ts — the tugbank domain/key constants for model persistence,
 * as a dependency-free leaf.
 *
 * These live apart from [model.ts] because `settings-api.ts` needs the domain
 * names (the card-keyed orphan sweep) while `model.ts` needs `settings-api`
 * transitively (through [model-catalog.ts]'s PUT). Holding the constants in a
 * module that imports nothing keeps that from closing into an import cycle,
 * where whichever module loaded second saw the other's constants still in
 * their temporal dead zone.
 *
 * `model.ts` re-exports every name here, so it remains the one place callers
 * import model persistence from.
