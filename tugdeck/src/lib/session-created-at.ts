/**
 * session-created-at.ts — when a session was made, from the two places that
 * know.
 *
 * The date the description line falls back to, and the date the telemetry panel
 * reports. Two sources, in this order:
 *
 *  1. **The session ledger's `created_at`** — the authority. It is present at
 *     zero turns, which is exactly the state a fallback is reporting on. The
 *     row is the CALLER's, not a read of this hook's own: every surface that
 *     wants the date is already holding the row for the facts beside it, and a
 *     second `useSessionLedgerRow` here was a duplicate subscription and a
 *     duplicate `findRow` scan on every session row in the app. The caller
 *     supplies whichever row it trusts — a picker's payload in hand, or the
 *     by-id lookup for the card that holds a just-spawned session the workspace
 *     listing deliberately omits.
 *  2. **The card's replay-derived anchor** — `sessionCreatedAtMs` on the card's
 *     own session store, which covers the window before the ledger answers. It
 *     is derived from the first turn entry in the JSONL, so it says nothing
 *     about a session that has not taken a turn — which is exactly why rung 1
 *     has to see the detached row.
 *
 * Null until one of them answers. Shared rather than re-derived per surface,
 * because a masthead and a Lens row dating the same session differently is the
 * failure one resolver exists to prevent ([D123]).
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the replay read enters through `useSyncExternalStore`; the
 *       ledger row arrives as a prop from the caller's own subscription.
 *
