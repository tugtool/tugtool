/**
 * asset-projection — the Text card's attachment strip, derived from the
 * document's own text.
 *
 * ## The strip is a projection, not a list
 *
 * There is no stored record anywhere of what a document has attached. The
 * document is the source of truth for what it references, and the first thing a
 * user does with a text editor is edit the text — a parallel store could only
 * ever disagree with it. So the strip is a pure function of the buffer plus
 * disk: parse the `assets/`-scoped links, resolve them against the document's
 * asset base, and publish a tile per link.
 *
 * That one decision buys three behaviors with no extra machinery. Typing a link
 * by hand lights a tile; deleting it removes the tile; undo restores both.
 * Pasted markdown that resolves simply appears in the strip, so no hidden "this
 * was an attachment" state has to survive the clipboard. And nothing about
 * attachments enters the card's persisted bag ([L23] — it stays positions-only).
 *
 * ## Cost
 *
 * The parse is fed from the editor's update listener and runs on an idle
 * timer, never synchronously with an edit transaction. Output is compared
 * structurally, so a keystroke in prose costs one regex pass and publishes
 * nothing — no store write, no React render.
 *
 * The projection performs **no byte I/O at all**. Tiles carry the resolved
 * path, and `TugAttachmentPreview` paints them through `/api/fs/blob`, which
 * streams and revalidates by `ETag`. Filling a bytes store with base64 would
 * park a whole document's assets in memory to draw thumbnails.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L02] this is external state; React reads it through `useSyncExternalStore`.
 *  - [L23] nothing here is persisted.
