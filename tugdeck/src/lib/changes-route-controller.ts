/**
 * changes-route-controller — the per-card Changes view-route store ([P07]).
 *
 * On the `±` route the Session card commits its session's changeset as one
 * unit ([P05]): every file this session is attributed to, one
 * `changeset_commit`. There is no per-file election — an AI session emits a
 * unified changeset; a file you don't want in it is a conversation with the
 * AI, not a checkbox. Unattributed files (no session claims them) are shown
 * for awareness but never swept into this session's commit.
 *
 * Below the file, though, a landing can be partial: {@link
 * ChangesRouteController.electHunks} persists which hunks of a path to land
 * ([P09], riding the draft's free-form selection), and {@link
 * ChangesRouteController.commit} sends them as `changeset_commit.hunks`. A
 * path with no election lands whole.
 *
 * It opens NO feed of its own — the per-workspace `CHANGESET` feed (0x23)
 * is retired. Instead it subscribes to the app-level `ChangesetAllStore`
 * singleton (`CHANGESET_ALL`, 0x24 — the same store the Lens reads) and
 * derives its slice as a filtered projection: this card's project by
 * `workspace_key`, its session entry by `owner_id`, the project's dash
 * entries, and the unattributed bucket.
 *
 * The commit and draft triggers are pass-throughs to the shipping app-level
 * verb / draft stores keyed by one identity (`entryKey` /
 * `(projectDir, "session", tugSessionId)`), so the view and the entry read
 * the same round-trip state.
 *
