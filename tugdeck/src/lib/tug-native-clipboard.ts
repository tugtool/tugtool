/**
 * tug-native-clipboard — native clipboard bridge for Tug.app (WKWebView).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Safari's JavaScript Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.readText` / `.read`)
 * triggers a floating "Paste" permission popup on every invocation, and in
 * Safari 16.4+ `document.execCommand("paste")` on contentEditable elements
 * triggers the same popup. There is no JavaScript-only path to read the
 * system clipboard from a WKWebView-hosted web page without the popup.
 *
 * The only way to supply clipboard data to JavaScript without the popup in
 * this context is to delegate to the native side: read `NSPasteboard.general`
 * from Swift and pass the contents back via `evaluateJavaScript`. Tug.app
 * (macOS host, `tugapp/Sources/MainWindow.swift`) exposes a
 * `WKScriptMessageHandler` named `clipboardRead` that does exactly this.
 * This module wraps the asynchronous message roundtrip in a Promise.
 *
 * ## Protocol
 *
 * 1. JS calls `readClipboardViaNative()`.
 * 2. This module generates a unique `requestId`, stores the promise's
 *    `resolve` in a pending-callbacks map keyed by that id, and posts
 *    `{ requestId }` to the Swift handler.
 * 3. Swift reads `NSPasteboard.general.string(forType: .string)` and
 *    `.html`, JSON-encodes them, and calls
 *    `window.__tugNativeClipboardCallback({ requestId, text, html })`.
 * 4. This module's callback looks up the resolver by `requestId`, deletes
 *    the entry, and resolves with `{ text, html }`.
 *
 * A safety timeout (1 second) guards against the Swift side never calling
 * back — the continuation would otherwise hang forever. On timeout the
 * promise resolves with empty strings.
 *
 * ## When to use
 *
 * In paste handlers that need clipboard access from a non-native gesture
 * (e.g. our custom context menu's Paste item). Check
 * `hasNativeClipboardBridge()` before calling: when the bridge is absent
 * (browser-only development, tests, standalone previews), fall back to the
 * JS Clipboard API. The native bridge is strictly a production-in-Tug.app
 * optimization — the JS fallback still works elsewhere, just with the
 * Safari popup if the user is on Safari.
