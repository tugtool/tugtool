/**
 * shell-grammar-store — the deck's client for tugcast's command-grammar grader.
 *
 * One instance per Session card session, sharing the card's `SHELL_OUTPUT`
 * `FeedStore` (no new feed — the same session-scoped filter `PathCommandsStore`
 * uses). A `shell_grammar` request carries one line; the reply echoes that line
 * with its band and, on `maybe` only, the program's own condensed
 * documentation. Answers are cached by exact line, because a user editing the
 * tail of a draft re-presents earlier prefixes constantly.
 *
 * Every failure resolves to `unknown`: no transport, no reply in time, a
 * malformed frame, or no store at all. `unknown` is byte-for-byte the
 * pre-grader path — ask the model, then apply the veto — so a grader that is
 * absent or slow changes nothing about how a line is routed.
 *
 * [L02] store surface (`subscribe` / `getSnapshot`); [L22] direct feed read.
