/**
 * command-atom — helpers for the slash-command atom: how its value
 * becomes the wire string claude expands, and how it reads in a chip.
 *
 * ## Why a command atom is special
 *
 * Accepting a `/` completion inserts an `AtomSegment` with
 * `type: "command"` whose `value` is the *bare* command name — no
 * leading slash (`tugplug:commit`, not `/tugplug:commit`). That bare
 * name is the single source of truth: it's what claude's catalog
 * reports, what the completion match keys off, what the
 * unsupported-command allowlist compares against, and what the chip
 * displays (a command chip reads as `tugplug:commit`, distinguished from
 * a file chip by its terminal icon, not by a leading slash).
 *
 * The leading slash is added at exactly one boundary — **the wire**
 * ({@link commandWireText}): the text block sent to claude must be a
 * *clean* `/name` (optionally ` args`) string. claude's CLI expands a
 * slash command into a **user invocation** (the path that bypasses a
 * skill's `disable-model-invocation` guard) only when the message text is
 * exactly the command. Any other shape — the backtick-`@` mention marker,
 * or a bare slashless name — defeats expansion: the literal reaches the
 * model instead, which tries the Skill tool (refused on a
 * `disable-model-invocation` skill) or improvises.
 *
 * Pure data helpers — no React, no DOM, no store dependency.
 *
