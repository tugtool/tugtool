/**
 * session-tag-store.ts — per-session mnemonic-tag cache for the Z4B chip.
 *
 * The tag lives authoritatively in tugcast's ledger and rides the `SessionRow`
 * shape on `list_sessions_ok` rows and `session_updated` pushes. The chooser
 * reads tags straight off those rows, but the Z4B chip needs the tag for *its
 * bound session* by id — so this tiny store indexes `tugSessionId → tag` and the
 * chip subscribes by id ([L02]).
 *
 * Populated from three sources (see `action-dispatch.ts`): a client spawn sets
 * it **optimistically** to the provisional tag so the chip shows one instantly
 * "from the drop"; `session_updated` pushes and `list_sessions_ok` / card-binding
 * rows make it **authoritative** (the callsign the ledger claimed). A blank
 * tag clears the entry.
 *
 * **The authoritative answer can differ from the optimistic one, and this store
 * is where the swap lands.** A tag any session ever minted is spent forever (the
 * ledger's append-only `minted_tags` arbiter), so a collision does not get a
 * numeric suffix — the ledger rerolls a complete fresh pair. A callsign shown
 * "from the drop" may therefore change **once**, seconds after spawn, when
 * {@link SessionTagStore.seedTag} takes the ledger's word; after that it is
 * immutable for the life of the session. See `session-tag.ts`'s header.
 *
 * A faithful clone of `session-name-store.ts`, plus the reverse `tag →
 * session_id` index its header once deferred: {@link SessionTagStore.resolveTag}
 * is what makes `/resume <tag>` possible, and it is exact-match only ([P12]).
 *
