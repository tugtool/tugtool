/**
 * Host menu state — the aggregator behind the `menuState` WKScriptMessage
 * push.
 *
 * The Swift host validates its menu bar from a cached snapshot of
 * frontend state (`AppDelegate.swift`, `MenuState` struct +
 * `validateMenuItem(_:)`). This module owns the frontend half of that
 * wire contract: it projects the deck store into the menu-relevant
 * shape, diffs, coalesces, and posts to
 * `webkit.messageHandlers.menuState`. Keep the payload fields in sync
 * with the Swift parser.
 *
 * Why an aggregator module rather than a push inside
 * `DeckManager.notify()`: menu enablement depends on more than deck
 * structure — the session card's session state (bound, can-interrupt,
 * permission mode) changes without any deck mutation, so a second
 * publisher has to feed the same channel. One module owning the merged
 * payload keeps one wire channel and one diff.
 *
 * Why diff + coalesce: deck notifications fire on every mutation and
 * session stores emit on every streaming token, but the menu-relevant
 * projection changes far less often. Posting only when the serialized
 * projection changes — coalesced on a microtask — keeps WKScriptMessage
 * traffic proportional to menu-relevant change, not store churn.
 *
 * No React consumer reads this state; it mirrors stores outward to the
 * host and never drives render.

/**
 * Edit-menu capability block: per-action enablement for the native
 * Edit menu (and the Find submenu), derived from the responder chain's
 * `validateAction` — the suite's single source of truth for whether the
 * focused surface handles an edit action (design decision D05). Each
 * flag is `true` iff a focused responder currently handles that action;
 * `false` when nothing in focus does (e.g. only the Settings card is
 * up), which is exactly when the menu item should be disabled.
 *
 * The Swift host validates the Edit items against this block, the same
 * pull-based way it validates the close items against `panes`. The
 * clipboard actions still execute natively (Swift re-dispatches the
 * AppKit selector) so the system pasteboard and the in-gesture clipboard
 * path are preserved — for those, this block governs *enablement only*.
 *
 * Undo / Redo are here AND card-specific. The platform's NSUndoManager
 * (which AppKit would otherwise validate `undo:` against) is per-web-view:
 * it accumulates the whole view's edit history and knows nothing about
 * card activation, so a deactivated card's undo state would keep leaking
 * into the menu. The responder chain is card-scoped by construction — the
 * first responder lives inside the active card — so undo/redo ride this
 * block like the other edit actions, with the depth-accuracy supplied by
 * each editor's `validateAction` (CM6 reports `undoDepth`/`redoDepth` of
 * its own per-instance history).
 *
 * Native `<input>`/`<textarea>` take the third path: their undo stack is
 * the browser's (JS-opaque), reachable through the web view's
 * NSUndoManager. When the focused element is a native text control,
 * `nativeUndoToken` is non-zero and the Swift side validates Undo/Redo
 * LIVE from `webView.undoManager.canUndo`/`canRedo` and executes the
 * native `undo:`/`redo:` selectors. The token changes whenever the
 * focused native control changes (and drops to 0 on blur); the host
 * clears the web view's undo stack on every token change, so the
 * per-web-view stack never outlives focus in one control — that is what
 * keeps the native path card-safe.
 *
 * A chord whose menu item validates DISABLED is eaten at the menu bar
 * with a beep (standard macOS) — it does NOT fall through to the web
 * view. That is why the native path must light the item: a dark Undo
 * means a dead ⌘Z.
