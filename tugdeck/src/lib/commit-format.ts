/**
 * Commit formatting — the one vocabulary for stating a commit's shape.
 *
 * "What did this commit touch?" is answered on five surfaces: the hover over
 * a sha, the History shade's rows, the `/commit` receipt's stat badges, the
 * Changes sheet header, and the copy payload. Each grew its own spelling of
 * the same three facts — a status mark, a ± pair, and a file count — so the
 * same commit could read `33 files changed, +3461 −128` in one place and
 * `33 files changed +3461 −128` two inches away.
 *
 * This module owns the parts, and the sentences are assembled from them here
 * rather than at each call site. Three status vocabularies arrive at the door
 * — `git show`'s words (`modified`), porcelain's codes (`??`, `RM`), and a
 * bare letter that is already a mark — so {@link statusMark} accepts all three
 * and answers in the house's own three letters ([D118]).
 *
 * Pure and presentation-only: nothing here knows where its facts came from.
 *
 * @module lib/commit-format
