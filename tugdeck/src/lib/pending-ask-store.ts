/**
 * `pendingAskStore` — routes questions raised from outside the turn stream.
 *
 * A command-line tool that is about to do something the developer will feel can
 * `POST /api/ask` to tugcast and block. Tugcast broadcasts an `ask` CONTROL
 * frame; this store parks it on the target session's `CodeSessionStore` as
 * `pendingAsk`, the Session card renders a dialog, and the answer goes back the
 * way it came.
 *
 * Routing is by `sessionId`. A frame with no `sessionId` lands on the active
 * session — a terminal one directory over has no way to know which card the
 * developer is looking at.
 *
 * The blocked caller is the reason for three behaviors that would otherwise
 * look over-careful:
 *
 *  - **A question that cannot be routed is answered immediately**, with its
 *    fallback choice, rather than dropped. Silence would leave the caller
 *    hanging until its own timeout.
 *  - **A session torn down under a live question answers on its way out**, for
 *    the same reason.
 *  - **A second question for a session already showing one is answered at
 *    once**, rather than replacing the dialog and orphaning the first caller.
 *
 * The fallback is the caller's `unattendedChoice` when it named one and the
 * declining option otherwise — see {@link fallbackChoice}. Both readings say
 * the same thing: this is the answer for a question no human ever saw.
 *
 * Everything outside the store — the wire, the focused session, the session
 * registry — arrives through {@link PendingAskContext}. Nothing is imported as a
 * singleton, so every path above is reachable from a unit test.
 *
 * **Laws:** [L02] — the store exposes `subscribe` + `getSnapshot`, and publishes
 * a new snapshot on every change; the dialog reads it through
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, never through component state.
 *
