/**
 * file-view-open-registry.ts — live index of mounted viewer cards, keyed by
 * card id, exposing each card's bound path.
 *
 * The read-only twin of `text-card-open-registry.ts`. The `open-file` action
 * uses it for the same path-keyed reuse: opening an image already on screen
 * raises that card instead of mounting a second copy of the same bytes.
 *
 * The entry interface is deliberately narrower than the Text card's. A viewer
 * is never dirty, has no unsaved mark, and has no lines to reveal, so those
 * members would be dead weight (or nullable holes on the text side) in a
 * shared registry.
 *
 * Entries are registered by `FileViewCardContent` in a layout effect and
 * removed on unmount. Callbacks read live state at call time ([L07]).
