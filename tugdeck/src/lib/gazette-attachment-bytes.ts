/**
 * `gazette-attachment-bytes` — the bytes behind the pictures in the Gazette's
 * transcript, read back from where tugcast rested them.
 *
 * ## Why a store at all
 *
 * The Gazette's post attachments are files: a question's images went up once,
 * tugcast wrote them beside the ledger, and the post says only where they are
 * ({@link GazetteAttachmentWire}). The strip that draws them is the app's own
 * {@link TugAttachmentPreview} — the same tiles, the same captions, the same
 * click-to-enlarge sheet the Session card's transcript shows — and that
 * component's substrate is an {@link AtomBytesStore} keyed by atom id. So the
 * job here is one adapter: a path becomes an atom id, and the bytes at that
 * path become the entry under it.
 *
 * One store for the whole channel, not one per post. Two posts that cite the
 * same file share the fetch, a re-render never re-reads, and paging older
 * history back in finds what it already has.
 *
 * ## Lazily, exactly once
 *
 * {@link hydrateGazetteAttachments} is called from the row that renders the
 * strip, which means the read happens for a post somebody is looking at rather
 * than for the whole ledger tail. Each path is fetched at most once: the
 * in-flight set is the interlock, so the twenty renders a settling column
 * produces cost one request.
 *
 * A read that fails leaves the id absent, which the strip already has a
 * meaning for — a reserved slot rather than a broken box — and the next mount
 * tries again. Nothing retries in a loop.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the store IS external state and the strip subscribes to it
 * through `useSyncExternalStore`; the fetch is a side effect the row asks for,
 * never a render.
 *
