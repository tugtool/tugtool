/**
 * session-name-store.ts — per-session name cache for the Z4B chip ([#step-13d]).
 *
 * The session name lives authoritatively in tugcast's ledger and rides the
 * `SessionRow` shape on `list_sessions_ok` rows and `session_updated` pushes.
 * The chooser reads names straight off those rows, but the Z4B chip needs the
 * name for *its bound session* by id — so this tiny store indexes
 * `tugSessionId → name` and the chip subscribes by id ([L02]).
 *
 * Populated from three sources (see `action-dispatch.ts`): the `/rename` surface
 * sets it **optimistically** so the chip updates instantly; `session_updated`
 * pushes and `list_sessions_ok` rows make it **authoritative** (a rename from
 * anywhere, or opening the chooser, fills it in). A blank name clears the entry.
 *
 * The optimistic write is only safe because the refusal is caught: the rename
 * surface arms a one-shot {@link SessionNameStore.awaitSettle} waiter before it
 * sends, holding the name being replaced, and a `rename_session_err` puts that
 * name back. Nothing else would — a failed write broadcasts no `session_updated`,
 * so an unreconciled optimistic name is permanent. A session is bound to exactly
 * one card (`card_id` is 1:1 on the ledger row), so the session id addresses the
 * waiter as precisely as a card id would.
 *
