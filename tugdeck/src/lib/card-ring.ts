/**
 * card-ring.ts — the deck's lateral card ring.
 *
 * Previous/Next Card walk one ring over every *visible* card position: each
 * tab of each pane the user can currently see. A pane is visible when it is
 * the front of its place — a slot, or a sidebar rail — or when it holds no
 * place at all (a free pane). Buried panes are the depth axis's territory
 * (Previous/Next Card in Stack).
 *
 * **The sidebars are on the ring, the Lens included.** They are cards the
 * user reads and types in, standing in plain sight, so a lateral walk that
 * skipped them would leave the one card always on screen as the one the
 * keyboard could not reach. `move-to-slot` excludes the Lens because a
 * sidebar takes no slot — that is a fact about slots, not a general rule
 * about sidebars, and reading it as one is what left the Lens off this ring
 * while Jots rode it. A rail is a place exactly as a slot is ([D128]), so a
 * rail's front is a ring position exactly as a slot's front is.
 *
 * The ring's order is structural, read from deck state alone: left-rail
 * front, slotted fronts by slot number, free panes left-to-right by stored
 * position, right-rail front. Within a pane, tabs run in `cardIds` order.
 * Structural rather than measured so the same function can gate the menu
 * item (`visibleCardCount` in the menu-state projection) and drive the
 * step, and the two can never disagree.
