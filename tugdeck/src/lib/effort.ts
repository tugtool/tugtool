/**
 * effort.ts — pure helpers for the dev-card reasoning-effort chip.
 *
 * No React, no DOM, no I/O — every export is a pure function or constant, so
 * the level ordering and label logic is unit-testable without a store or a
 * rendered component. The chip ([effort-chip.tsx]) and the picker hook
 * ([use-effort.ts] / [effort-picker-sheet.tsx]) consume these; tugbank
 * persistence and IPC live in the hook, not here.
 *
 * Reasoning effort is the Claude Code terminal's `/effort` control — "how
 * long Claude thinks before answering." Grounded in the claude 2.1.158
 * binary (`--effort <level>` help + the `initialize` capability response):
 *
 *  - The canonical level set is `low | medium | high | xhigh | max`, in that
 *    order of increasing thinking budget.
 *  - It is **model-gated and per-model**: the `initialize` `models[]` entries
 *    carry a `supportsEffort` flag (absent when unsupported, e.g. haiku) and a
 *    `supportedEffortLevels` list that VARIES by model — opus supports all
 *    five, sonnet supports four (no `xhigh`), haiku none. So the picker must
 *    offer the *active model's* `supportedEffortLevels`, not the full set.
 *  - There is **no current-effort field on the wire** — the terminal surfaces
 *    a level only when one has been explicitly set (`--effort`). So a session
 *    with no override has no level to show (`null` → "Default"); tugcode, the
 *    `--effort` owner, is the authority on the current level.
