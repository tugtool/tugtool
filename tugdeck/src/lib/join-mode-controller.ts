/**
 * join-mode-controller — per-card state + land path for join mode ([P01],
 * [P04], [P05]).
 *
 * Join mode is commit mode's twin in the dash lane: `/dash-join` (or the Z4A
 * Join segment, or the lane's Join affordance) turns the composer into the
 * join-message editor over a *previewed* merge, and Z5 swaps to cancel /
 * auto-message / join. Everything structural is `CommitModeController`'s shape
 * — the same four upstream stores folded into one referentially-stable
 * snapshot, the same enter / leave / exit / land triggers, the same staged-land
 * hook — so the composer drives both through one {@link LandingMode} slot and
 * neither has to know the other exists.
 *
 * What differs is what a landing *means* here. The gate's third reason is the
 * preview rather than the changeset: a join may land only over a preview that
 * came back clean, or over a candidate the resolution ladder built out of the
 * conflicts. Entering therefore fires a preview immediately — a landing surface
 * that opens without knowing whether it can land is the thing this mode exists
 * to fix. And the draft is the *dash's*: it keys on the dash's owner id, so the
 * message the run's `tugutil draft set` maintained is what the editor opens on.
 *
