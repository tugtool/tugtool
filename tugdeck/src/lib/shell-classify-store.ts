/**
 * shell-classify-store — the deck's client for the SharedAgent's shell
 * arbitration verdict.
 *
 * One instance per Session card session, sharing the card's `SHELL_OUTPUT`
 * `FeedStore` (no new feed — the same session-scoped filter `ShellGrammarStore`
 * and `PathCommandsStore` use). A `shell_classify` request carries one line and,
 * on the `maybe` band, the program's own condensed documentation; the reply
 * echoes the line and whether documentation was sent, and those two together are
 * the correlation key. They must be a pair: the same line answered with and
 * without documentation is two different questions, cached separately, and a
 * reply that carried only the line could resolve the wrong wait.
 *
 * **Everything degrades to `null`.** No transport, no reply in time, a malformed
 * frame, `ok:false`, a refusal — all resolve `null`, and `null` means the line
 * goes to Claude, which is byte-for-byte the pre-model path. A caller that has
 * to special-case failure is a caller doing it wrong.
 *
 * [L02] store surface (`subscribe` / `getSnapshot`); [L22] direct feed read;
 * [L27] the feed subscription acquired in the constructor is released in
 * `dispose()`, as is every parked resolver's timer.
