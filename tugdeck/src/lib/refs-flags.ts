/**
 * refs-flags — the typed-flag grammar for `/match` and `/search` ([P07]).
 *
 * A refs command is `<needles…>` plus short flags. This module is the ONE
 * place that grammar lives: it parses a typed argument line into the needles
 * and the normalized flag record the feed's serde enums read, and it emits
 * the inverse — flags back to the tokens that would produce them. The
 * deferred option cluster (chips writing flags into the draft) calls the
 * emitter rather than growing a second grammar that can drift from this one.
 *
 * Typed flags are the truth ([P07]): whatever a future chip surface shows, it
 * has to be expressible as a line the user could have typed.
 *
 * Pure data + pure functions — no React, no DOM, no store.
