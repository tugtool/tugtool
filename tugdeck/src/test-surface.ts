/**
 * test-surface.ts -- In-app test harness surface (`window.__tug`).
 *
 * Scope of this module
 * --------------------
 * Exports {@link TugTestSurface} — the TypeScript interface the Swift
 * bridge talks to via `evaluateJavaScript` — and
 * {@link createTugTestSurface}, which binds that interface to a live
 * {@link DeckManager} instance. Also contains the `__tugTestMode`
 * guarded attach that installs `window.__tug` from `main.tsx`.
 *
 * Authoritative references
 * ------------------------
 * - [D01]: per-test isolation via granular `reset`.
 * - [D03]: DEBUG-only / release-safe.
 * - [D11]: surface is versioned; harness handshakes.
 *
 * DEV/test-mode gating
 * --------------------
 * The `window.__tug` global is attached only when
 * `import.meta.env.DEV && window.__tugTestMode === true`. The
 * attach site lives in {@link attachTugTestSurface} so `main.tsx`'s
 * boot path stays readable. Release builds never reach the attach
 * path (Vite strips the `if (import.meta.env.DEV && ...)` branch) and
 * production dev builds never reach it either unless the Swift host
 * injects the `__tugTestMode` flag via a DEBUG-only `WKUserScript`
 * ([D03]/[D08]).
 *
 * Versioning
 * ----------
 * {@link SURFACE_VERSION} is a semver string literal baked into the
 * surface. The harness reads it during the handshake ([D11]) and
 * rejects connections whose major version doesn't match. Bump the
 * major on breaking changes, the minor on additive changes, and
 * coordinate with the in-app harness when the wire shape changes.

/**
 * The `window.__tug` surface version. Bumped on breaking changes; the
 * Phase 2 harness handshake (see [D11]) asserts compatibility before
 * issuing any other RPC.
 *
 * Matched on major. Minor bumps denote additive fields only.
 *
 * `1.1.0` (harness extensions, 2026-04-24): adds the introspection
 * family — {@link TugTestSurface.getElementText},
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getElementValue},
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getElementAttribute},
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getElementBounds},
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getElementState},
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getActiveElement},
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getSelection},
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getComputedStyleValue}. The native-gesture
 * and keyboard-control families live out-of-band on the RPC bridge
 * (see `tugapp/Sources/TestHarness/NativeEventHandlers.swift`) — JS
 * cannot post `CGEvent`s, so there is nothing for `__tug` to expose
 * for those verbs. Major stays `1`; additive.
 *
 * `1.2.0`: adds EM-card
 * observation surface — {@link TugTestSurface.getEmCardState} and
 * {@link TugTestSurface.awaitEngineReady}. `getEngineSelection` and
 * `drainTugcodeTurn` are not separate surface entry points: the former is
 * subsumed by `getEmCardState().engineSelection`, the latter
 * requires tugcast-bypass plumbing not yet in place. Tugcode
 * lifecycle delegates (`startTugcode` / `stopTugcode` / etc.)
 * live as RPC verbs on the App handle in `_harness/index.ts`,
 * not on `__tug.*` — page-side delegates would be a layering
 * violation (only Swift can spawn subprocesses). Major stays `1`;
 * additive.
 *
 * `1.3.0`: adds
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getCardStateBag} (full bag introspection
 * for [AT0017] saveState-RPC-parity) and {@link TugTestSurface.closePane}
 * (whole-pane teardown for [AT0019] flush coverage). Markdown content
 * fixtures for [AT0014] / [AT0023] ride through a separate
 * `gallery-markdown-50kb` card registration that bakes 50KB of
 * static content on mount — no test-specific surface needed.
 * Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.4.0`: adds
 * {@link TugTestSurface.appReload} and
 * {@link TugTestSurface.getReadyGen}. `appReload` invokes the
 * same `dispatchAction({ action: "reload" })` path the
 * `Maker > Reload` menu fires — `prepareForReload` →
 * synchronous flush → `location.reload()`. `getReadyGen` returns
 * a generation counter that {@link attachTugTestSurface}
 * increments at every page boot, persisted across reloads via
 * `sessionStorage`. The bun-side `app.appReload()` records the
 * pre-reload value, fires `appReload`, and polls `getReadyGen`
 * until it advances — that's the "the new page is up" signal,
 * tolerant of mid-navigation `evaluateJavaScript` errors.
 * Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.7.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.ingestRateLimit} — drives the
 * app-level, account-global rate-limit store so the banner app-test
 * ([#step-3.5]) can mount / clear the deck-wide banner without a live
 * claude limit. Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.8.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.ingestSessionMetadata} — drives a dev
 * card's `SessionMetadataStore` with a decoded `session_capabilities` /
 * `system_metadata` payload, so the Z4B effort-chip app-test ([#step-4]) can
 * mount the chip and exercise its model gate without a live claude handshake.
 * The chip reads its own `SESSION_SIDEBAND` FeedStore, which the
 * `driveSession`/`ingestFrame` (CodeSessionStore) path does not reach.
 * Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.10.0`: adds `ingestGitDiff` — drives a session card's `GitDiffStore` with
 * a decoded `git_diff_response` payload, so the `/diff` sheet app-test
 * ([#step-10b]) can render the per-file accordion without a live tugcast git
 * round-trip (which [#step-10a]'s subprocess test proves). Additive; major
 * stays `1`. **Removed in `2.0.0`.**
 *
 * `1.12.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.getSessionPerf} — reads a bound dev
 * card's perf instrumentation (replay-ingest / live-turn commit counters +
 * row-parse counters) so the resume-performance baseline and budget
 * app-tests assert internal splits without scraping the log stream.
 * Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.14.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.ingestSideQuestionAnswer} — settles a
 * session card's `SideQuestionStore` with a decoded `side_question_answer`
 * payload, so the `/btw` overlay app-test can render an answer (and assert the
 * transcript stays clean) without a live claude round-trip. Additive; major
 * stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.15.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.reprojectFocus} — asks the focus engine
 * to reproject its DOM marks from current state, so a test can prove the marks
 * are a convergent image of that state (reproject, diff, expect no change)
 * rather than a residue of the transitions that wrote them. Additive; major
 * stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.17.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.publishPulseFrame} — delivers a PULSE
 * frame body as if it arrived over the wire, so a test can put a session
 * overview or a beat on screen without a live commentator behind it.
 *
 * `1.16.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.currentGesture} — the live pointer
 * gesture's classification record, so a test can assert what the interpreter
 * decided (activation, promotion, placement, the named reasons) rather than
 * only the downstream effects. Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.18.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.setTranscriptEvictionDisabled} — the
 * tile-ledger cell's A/B arm (scrolling-memory-diet §G2): renders session
 * transcripts with `evictOffscreen` withheld so the lab can compare graphics
 * backing store between the evicted and full-inline DOM at identical layer
 * height. Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.19.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.activateCard} — the raise gesture as
 * a surface verb (mirrors `closePane`), for the pane-occlusion cell
 * ([AT0332]): a fully-buried pane cannot be reached by a click, so the test
 * raises it the way a Lens Cards row does, through
 * `DeckManager.activateCard`. Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.20.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.getScrollDisplacementCount} and
 * {@link TugTestSurface.forceCommitClamp} — the displacement bracket's two
 * seams. The reader returns the count as a number rather than by scraping
 * `data-scroll-displacements`; the clamp simulator reproduces a real
 * commit-scoped browser clamp from *inside* a React commit, which `evalJS`
 * cannot reach from outside. Both resolve the scroller by its
 * `data-tug-scroll-key` selector. Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.21.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.setTranscriptFollowBottom} — forces a
 * scroller's follow-bottom flag through the scroller registry. The
 * disengaged-at-the-bottom state cannot be reached by `scrollTop` assignment
 * (a downward assignment into the band re-engages before the test can assert),
 * and that state is precisely the one the field reports describe. Additive;
 * major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.22.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.getListConservation} — the eviction
 * height-accounting probe. Returns the per-eviction ledger-vs-live records
 * accumulated since mount plus a same-moment audit of every mounted cell, so
 * a test can measure the document height error a window swap introduced
 * rather than inferring it from `scrollTop` symptoms. Additive; major
 * stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.23.0`: {@link TugTestSurface.getListConservation} additionally returns
 * `floor` — the extent floor's current height and calibrated bottom inset,
 * so a test can assert the floor is standing (height tracks the settled
 * extent) rather than inferring its presence from the absence of
 * displacements. Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `1.24.0`: the displacement bracket is an assertion layer. A clamp armed
 * through {@link TugTestSurface.forceCommitClamp} is witnessed — counted,
 * traced, attributed via `noteExternalWrite` — and the position is left
 * where the browser put it; nothing counter-writes it back. The
 * `scroll-displacement` trace event loses its `repaired` and
 * `priorRepairHeld` fields with the machinery. Behavioral; major stays `1`
 * because every surface method keeps its signature.
 *
 * `1.25.0`: {@link TugTestSurface.deleteTugbankValue} — the deletion half of
 * `setTugbankValue`, for the domains where a key's absence is the meaningful
 * state (a keymap override reset is a `DELETE`). Additive; major stays `1`.
 *
 * `2.0.0`: REMOVES `ingestGitDiff` and the per-card `GitDiffStore` behind it.
 * The `/diff` sheet it was built for is gone (`/diff` opens the Project Diff
 * card), and every remaining diff surface sources its own store off the shared
 * unfiltered feed in `changeset-diff-store` — so the card-scoped store had no
 * reader left and its GIT_DIFF feed subscription was waking per card for
 * nothing. A removal is breaking by the rule above, hence the major; no
 * consumer gates on this constant, and the harness's own surface version
 * (`_harness/index.ts`) is a separate number that does not move.
 *
 * `2.1.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.publishGazettePost} — delivers a GAZETTE
 * frame body as if it arrived over the wire, so a test can put a Reporter post
 * with its refs on the card without a live Reporter behind it. Additive; major
 * stays `2`.
 *
 * `2.2.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.recordActivity} — records units on a
 * session's activity channel through the real `SessionActivityStore`, so a test
 * can drive a live sparkline tape deterministically instead of waiting on a
 * real stream. Additive; major stays `2`.
 *
 * `2.3.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.getPaneRecord} — a pane's STORED
 * position, size, slot, and width stamp, so a test can assert what a derived
 * presentation did NOT write. Additive; major stays `2`.
 *
 * `2.4.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.publishSessionUpdated} — delivers a
 * `session_updated` ledger row through the real action dispatch, so a test can
 * rename a session the way the wire does and watch every identity surface
 * repaint. Additive; major stays `2`.
 *
 * `2.5.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.copySessionAtom} — writes a session atom
 * to the real pasteboard through the production writer, so a test can assert
 * the flavors and the paste round-trip without driving a context menu.
 * Additive; major stays `2`.
 *
 * `2.6.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.measureFaceAdvance} — the advance of a
 * string in the face an element actually renders in, through the production
 * `font-metrics` pair, so a width constant derived from a type size can be
 * pinned against the real render instead of against a fallback. Additive;
 * major stays `2`.
 *
 * `2.7.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.publishGazettePostsPage} — hands a
 * `list_gazette_posts_ok` body to the production CONTROL-response bus, the
 * page sibling of `publishGazettePost`'s feed frame. It exists because
 * `publishGazettePost` cannot reach paging at all: it routes to the client
 * store's fold and never touches the wire, so nothing it publishes is ever
 * persisted and no amount of it seeds a ledger to page through. This enters
 * the production chain one function later than a wire response does, and
 * drives the real correlation, dedupe, prepend, and scroll compensation.
 * Additive; major stays `2`.
 *
 * `2.8.0`: adds {@link TugTestSurface.getTugbankValue} — the read counterpart
 * to `setTugbankValue`. A card's per-card view settings resolve from the deck
 * defaults until the first change and are card-local afterwards, and the two
 * states look identical on screen; only the store says which one is in force.
 * Additive; major stays `2`.
