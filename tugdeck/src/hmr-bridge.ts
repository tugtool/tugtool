/**
 * tugdeck/src/hmr-bridge.ts
 *
 * Bridge Vite's HMR pre-update / pre-full-reload events into the
 * deck-manager save pipeline so user-visible state survives the
 * React Fast Refresh remounts that follow a hot-replaced module.
 *
 * # Why this exists
 *
 * The Component State Preservation Protocol
 * (`tuglaws/state-preservation.md`) captures bag.content /
 * bag.components / bag.scroll / bag.formControls / bag.regionScroll /
 * bag.domSelection / bag.focus at a small, deliberate set of "known
 * transitions": tab deactivation, `saveState` RPC, `beforeunload`,
 * close-before-destroy. Outside those moments, the framework writes
 * nothing — DOM stays mounted across in-app transitions, so there is
 * nothing to preserve.
 *
 * Vite's HMR breaks that assumption. When an upstream module change
 * (e.g. a CSS-token tweak in `tug-text-editor/theme.ts`) invalidates a
 * downstream React component (`tug-text-editor.tsx`), Fast Refresh remounts
 * the component. The DOM is torn down — but none of the four
 * known-transition triggers fire, because HMR is not a user-visible
 * event the framework knows about. CM6's internal text state, scroll
 * position, selection, and any other state owned by a non-React
 * authority is silently lost.
 *
 * This module makes HMR a fifth (and sixth, counting full-reload)
 * known transition. Vite's HMR API exposes synchronous events
 * (`vite:beforeUpdate`, `vite:beforeFullReload`) that fire before
 * any module replacement applies. We register handlers that fire the
 * same iterate-and-save pass `beforeunload` already runs; the bag
 * lands in deck-manager's in-memory cache before Fast Refresh
 * remounts anything. The matching restore-side change (in
 * `card-host.tsx`) detects the no-op-pair → real-callbacks
 * transition that signals a content-factory remount and replays the
 * bag through the existing `onRestore` path.
 *
 * # Theme-only update fast path
 *
 * Theme switches (the user clicks a theme, or edits a token value in
 * `styles/themes/*.css`) only mutate CSS — no React-side state
 * depends on the outgoing theme. Running `captureAllForTeardown` for
 * those HMR passes is wasted work that scales with per-card bag size
 * (e.g. the prompt-entry's bytes-store of inline image attachments).
 *
 * The dev server's `themeSaveLoadPlugin` and `controlTokenHotReload`
 * broadcast a `tug:theme-changed` custom HMR event immediately after
 * writing `tug-active-theme.css`. WebSocket order is TCP-preserved,
 * and the subsequent file-watcher-driven `vite:beforeUpdate` is
 * processed milliseconds later — so the client always sees the
 * custom event first. We use that as a reliable discriminator
 * because the path-suffix approach doesn't work (Vite reports the
 * JS-graph accept boundary, not the file that actually changed).
 *
 * The arming is time-bounded so a stale arming (the rare case where
 * a theme event fires but the matching `vite:beforeUpdate` never
 * does) can't suppress capture on a later unrelated HMR pass.
 *
 * # Why a bridge module rather than inline in main.tsx
 *
 * Keeping the Vite-specific surface (`import.meta.hot.*`) in a
 * named module makes the dev-only contract greppable, lets the
 * docstring explain the design once, and gives the file a
 * deterministic identity for the self-HMR pattern below.
 *
 * # Production safety
 *
 * `import.meta.hot` is `undefined` in production builds — Vite
 * strips it during the production bundle pass. The function body
 * therefore compiles to dead code in shipped bundles; the module
 * itself is tree-shakeable to nothing if the lone `installHmrBridge`
 * import is removed by the bundler. In practice the call site in
 * `main.tsx` survives, but the early-return ensures zero runtime
 * cost.
 *
 * # Self-HMR safety
 *
 * If THIS module is itself hot-replaced (someone edits this file),
 * Vite will re-evaluate the body. Without `accept`, the new body's
 * `on(...)` calls add fresh listeners while the old listeners may
 * remain alive — every subsequent HMR would then fire the save pass
 * twice (or N times after N edits to this file). The bridge changes
 * rarely; we forfeit the marginal benefit of incremental update
 * here and ask Vite to do a full page reload instead by calling
 * `import.meta.hot.invalidate()` from inside `accept`. One
 * registration, ever.
 *
 * # Laws
 *
 * [L23] (preserve user-visible state across known transitions —
 * adds HMR to the recognized set);
 * [L03] (`import.meta.hot.on` registration runs at module init,
 * before any React render, before any keyboard / pointer event);
 * [L07] (handler closes over `deck` — a stable singleton
 * constructed once in `main.tsx` — and reads through it at call
 * time, not via stale closure capture of any deck-internal state);
 * [L10] (the bridge sits at the deck level; it calls a public
 * method on the deck-manager and does not reach into card or pane
 * internals);
 * [L19] (file follows tugways file-conventions: module docstring,
 * single named export);
 * [L21] (`import.meta.hot.*` is Vite's own runtime API, not
 * third-party code we are copying — no `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
 * entry needed).
