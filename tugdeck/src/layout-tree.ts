/**
 * Canvas data model for the card system (two-table shape).
 *
 * DeckState holds two flat arrays:
 *   - `cards`: the content identities — id, componentId, title, closable,
 *     plus an optional persistence bag.
 *   - `panes`: the visual frames — position, size, ordered cardIds, the
 *     active card in the pane, collapsed, acceptsFamilies, title.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   1. Every `cardIds` entry in every pane references a real card (by id) in
 *      `deckState.cards`.
 *   2. Each card appears in exactly one pane's `cardIds` (no orphans, no
 *      duplicates).
 *   3. No pane has an empty `cardIds` array — closing the last card of a
 *      pane closes the pane.
 *   4. Each pane's `activeCardId` is a member of that pane's `cardIds`.
 *   5. `activePaneId`, when set, references a real pane in `panes`.

 *
 * Distinct from `bag.scroll`, which captures the card's *outer*
 * host-content scroll (one per card). `regionScroll` covers inner
 * scrollers — most notably `tug-markdown-view`'s virtual-list
 * container — that the user has scrolled independently.
 *
 * Uniqueness of keys within a card subtree is an author contract
 * (same rule as `data-tug-state-key`): `CardHost` walks the card
 * root and writes the last-encountered value per key.
 *
 * **Per-region metadata (`meta`).** Optional, opaque per-region
 * JSON-serializable payload alongside `{x, y}`. The framework treats
 * it as transparent storage; regions encode their own semantics.
 *
 * Motivating use case: variable-height virtualized lists (e.g.
 * `TugListView` driving the tide-card transcript) cannot rely on raw
 * `{x, y}` alone because cell heights drift between save and restore
 * — markdown content arrives, tool blocks settle, file viewers
 * measure their substrates — and the saved pixel `y` no longer maps
 * to the saved *content* by the time the bag is replayed. Such
 * regions write a `(anchorIndex, anchorOffset)` payload into `meta`
 * and read it back on `tug-region-scroll-set`; the framework's
 * `MutationObserver`-driven retry loop continues to operate against
 * `{x, y}` for the settle check, while the region's listener re-
 * derives the target `scrollTop` from its live layout state on
 * every commit.
 *
 * **Geometry schemas.** Three families of `meta` payload ship today.
 * The TypeScript shape stays `meta?:
 * unknown` because per-region writers own their schema; the prose
 * below documents the conventions so substrates that extend them
 * stay coherent. A meta payload may carry any combination of the
 * three; listeners that don't recognize a key ignore it.
 *
 *  - `meta.anchor: { index: number; offset: number }` —
 *    cell-relative scroll anchor for variable-height virtualized
 *    lists.
 *
 *  - `meta.cellHeights: number[]` — per-cell measured heights at
 *    save time (`heightIndex.snapshot()`), array index = cell index.
 *    Unmeasured cells get `0` entries. Hydrated into the live
 *    `HeightIndex` at restore so the first paint's anchor-resolve
 *    math is exact, not estimated. Cells render with inline
 *    `min-height` from this array until their own ResizeObserver
 *    reports a fresh measurement.
 *
 *  - `meta.line: { number: number; offsetPx: number }` —
 *    content-anchored scroll position for code editors (CM6 in
 *    `FileBlock`). `number` is the 1-based line number; `offsetPx`
 *    is the intra-line pixel offset of the viewport top from the
 *    line's top. On restore the substrate dispatches its own
 *    scrollIntoView so the saved line lands at the viewport top
 *    regardless of how the font metric resolves on the new page.
 *
 *  - `meta.scrollHeight: number` — validation field; captures the
 *    scroller's total content height at save time. Not consumed at
 *    restore today (deterministic scrollers don't need it); kept
 *    for symmetry and forward-compat cross-version layout checks.
 *
 * Fixed-height inner scrollers (`TerminalBlock` virtualized line
 * pool, markdown view) restore correctly from raw `{x, y}` alone
 * because their internal layout is deterministic across reload;
 * they may still write `meta.scrollHeight` for documentation /
 * cross-version validation.

 *     `data-tug-focus-key="<key>"` marker (e.g. a button, a card-local
 *     menu trigger). Keyed lookup on restore.
 *   - `engine` — focus belongs to a content-owning engine that exposes
 *     a `paintMirrorAsActive` hook (CodeMirror-backed TugTextEditor,
 *     tide prompt-input contentEditable, etc.). The framework's
 *     single-channel dispatcher invokes `store.invokeEnginePaintMirrorAsActive(cardId)`
 *     to drive the claim; the engine no longer self-claims via
 *     `onCardActivated`. See `tuglaws/state-preservation.md`'s
 *     [Focus dispatch model] section. _Migration:_ persisted bags from
 *     before Phase E.11 stored `{ kind: "component-owned" }` for this
 *     case; the deserialization boundary coerces those reads to
 *     `engine` so old bags continue to drive the correct dispatch
 *     path (see `coerceFocusSnapshotOnRead` in `card-host.tsx`).
 *   - `none` — no interesting focus inside the card (or focus is on
 *     `document.body`, or outside the card root entirely).
 *

 * the active pane (see [D10]). In-app transitions preserve focus by
