/**
 * Serialization, deserialization, and default layout for DeckState.
 *
 * **Current wire format:** `version: 4` with on-disk keys
 * `{ version: 4, cards, panes, activePaneId?, imposition }`, with `panes[]`
 * carrying the additive-optional `slot?` and `imposition` carrying
 * `{ kind?, lens }`. `imposition` was a bare kind string in earlier v4 blobs
 * and both shapes parse — the widening is additive, so no version bump.
 * `focusedCardId` is persisted separately via `putFocusedCardId` and is not
 * part of the layout blob.
 *
 * **Pre-v4 on-disk shape (migrated on load):** `version: 3` used `windows` and
 * `activeWindowId` instead of `panes` / `activePaneId`. Those blobs are normalized
 * by {@link migrateV3ToV4} before the same parsing and clamping as v4.
 *
 * **Load path:**
 * - `version === 4` — parsed by {@link parseV4}.
 * - `version === 3` — {@link migrateV3ToV4} (field rename only) then {@link parseV4}.
 * - `version === 2` — legacy two-table blob (`stacks`, `activeStackId`); {@link migrateV2ToV4}
 *   bridges to pre-v4 v3 wire names, then {@link migrateV3ToV4} → {@link parseV4}.
 * - Missing `version` or other legacy shapes — if `cards` is an array, the
 *   historical single-table blob (`version: 5`, `cards[].tabs[]`, etc.) is
 *   migrated by {@link migrateV1ToDeckState}. Unrelated shapes (e.g. stray
 *   `version: 4` objects without valid `cards`/`panes`) fall through to
 *   {@link buildDefaultLayout}.
 *
 * Legacy card ids become pane ids; legacy tab ids become card ids — identity
 * is preserved so per-card state in tugbank remains keyed by the same id strings.
