/**
 * jots-card-registration.tsx — registers the Jots card ([L25]).
 *
 * Jots is an ordinary registered card hosted by the normal `CardHost` inside a
 * sidebar pane, exactly as the Lens is: the pane/card machinery (FocusContext,
 * responder scope, title-bar chrome) is what makes focus restore and the pane's
 * own affordances nearly free.
 *
 * INVARIANT: `registerJotsCard()` MUST run at boot unconditionally and before
 * the deck restores its layout — `filterRegisteredCards` drops panes whose only
 * card's componentId is unregistered at load, so a gated Jots card would
 * evaporate its rail on every reload.
 *
 * `family: "jots"` (a family no free pane's `acceptsFamilies` lists) plus
 * `acceptsFamilies: []` makes the card un-mergeable in both directions.
