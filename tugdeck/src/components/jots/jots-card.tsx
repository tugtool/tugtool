/**
 * jots-card.tsx — the **Jots** card: a keyboard-navigable `TugListView` of
 * reusable prompt fragments backed by the machine-global `jots.json`
 * (`jotsStore`).
 *
 * Jots is a capture surface, not a lens onto the deck, so it stands as its own
 * sidebar card rather than as a band inside the Lens. It brings its own chrome
 * — filter field, `+`, focus group — where it used to rent the Lens band's.
 *
 * The list is authored into the card's focus group, so it is one Tab stop.
 * The grammar:
 *  - **Arrows** rove the cursor and carry the selection with it
 *    (`selectionFollowsCursor`) — the green fill is always on the row the
 *    keyboard is on, which is also the row the section verbs act on;
 *    **ArrowRight** descends onto the row's Copy / ✕, which the horizontal
 *    arrows then walk; **Enter** opens the cursor row's editor
 *    (`onActivate` → `beginEdit`), which mounts a `TugMessageEditor` (the
 *    `TugTextEditor` CM6 substrate, markdown-styled) inside a focusable
 *    wrapper authored into the row's descend scope; the row claims the CM6
 *    caret itself (the engine's ladder yields keys to a focused editor).
 *    **Escape** ascends the row scope (the wrapper's handler — the surface
 *    owns its Escape) and the resulting **blur** commits; **⌘Return**
 *    commits and chains a new jot. **Space** selects only.
 *  - Card verbs while the list holds the key view (delivered via the
 *    list's `onKeyViewKey` delegate — the [P05] channel): **Space** creates
 *    below the cursor, **Delete** removes the cursor row (read from the
 *    projected `data-key-cursor`) and lands the cursor on the surviving
 *    neighbor, **⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z** undo/redo (via a chain responder, active only
 *    in list mode so the editor's CM6 undo wins while typing). Each display
 *    row also carries a hover-reveal delete button for the pointer.
 *  - A row's incipit is draggable into a session prompt (native HTML5 drag,
 *    `jotDragStart`); dragging the row VERTICALLY reorders instead
 *    (commit on drop, [Q02]). One surface, two drags, told apart by axis in
 *    `block-reorder`.
 *
 * One cell kind (`"jot"`) branches display/editor on `editingId` — never
 * two kinds for one row ([L26]). Laws: [L02] store via `useSyncExternalStore`;
 * [L06] cursor/selection appearance is CSS on engine attributes; [L22] the
 * FocusManager owns the cursor and the descend scope; [L11] the editor's
 * CUT/COPY/PASTE/SELECT_ALL/UNDO/REDO responders ride the composed substrate.
