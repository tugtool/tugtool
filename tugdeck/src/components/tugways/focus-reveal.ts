/**
 * `focus-reveal` — bring a keyboard-focused element into view.
 *
 * The focus engine never lets the browser scroll: every DOM focus write it
 * issues passes `{ preventScroll: true }`, because scroll-position writes
 * belong to the owning surface / SmartScroll ([D07]). That leaves a hole the
 * surfaces were each patching by hand: a keyboard move that lands the key view
 * on a stop below the fold rings an element the user cannot see.
 *
 * This module closes it with one cooperative reveal, called by the engine when
 * a KEYBOARD key view changes ({@link FocusContext.setKeyView}). It is not a
 * `scrollIntoView`: that reasons about one scrollport's geometry, fights the
 * transcript's follow-bottom pin, and happily parks its target under a stuck
 * sticky header. Instead {@link revealFocusTarget}:
 *
 *  - walks every scrollable ancestor from the target outward, innermost first,
 *    re-measuring after each write (an outer scroll moves the target);
 *  - scrolls each by the MINIMUM delta that brings the target inside — so an
 *    already-visible target costs nothing and no write is ever gratuitous;
 *  - insets the scrollport by any sticky chrome parked over its edges, so the
 *    target lands BELOW a stuck header rather than under it;
 *  - leaves {@link RING_GAP_PX} of air on the leading edge, because the focus
 *    ring paints outside the border box (`--tugx-focus-ring-offset` +
 *    `--tugx-focus-ring-width`, `focus-ring.css`) and a flush landing clips it;
 *  - releases follow-bottom on any scroller that registered a
 *    {@link Scroller} façade before writing, so SmartScroll's next pin does not
 *    yank the reveal back to the live edge.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] a scroll write is appearance: DOM only, no React state crossed.
 *  - [D07] the engine still issues no focus-driven browser scroll; this is an
 *    explicit, surface-cooperative reveal that routes through the registered
 *    `SmartScroll` façade rather than around it.
