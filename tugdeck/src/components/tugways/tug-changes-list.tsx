/**
 * `TugChangesList` — a read-only list of changed files with inline diffs
 * ([P01], Spec S01). One `TugListRow` per file (compact, mono): a status
 * glyph + path (a file reference — under a transcript's annotation scope it
 * is stamped as one, so the host's own menu serves it), the house `+N −M` badge
 * pair, a pop-out-to-a-card diff affordance, and a fold cue, over a diff
 * body that expands and collapses in place. Every row is expandable —
 * untracked files diff via the backend's synthesized new-file diffs.
 *
 * Two diff sources share the row renderer:
 *  - the live list (`TugChangesList`) diffs the working tree (`head`
 *    flavor, eagerly fetched so the ± badges fill in), and
 *  - the `/commit` receipt (`CommitChangesList`) diffs one committed sha
 *    (`commit` flavor, fetched lazily per row on first expand — the counts
 *    are frozen in the receipt record, so nothing loads until you look).
 *
 * The component owns diff fetching — one `GitDiffStore` per entry / per
 * expanded receipt row, dropped on unmount — and nothing else: live
 * per-file collapse is CONTROLLED by the host (`expandedKeys` +
 * `onToggleFile`) so each host keeps its own fold-all / whole-diff chrome.
 *
 * A session-entry row can also elect *which hunks* of a file the landing
 * takes ([P09]): the expanded diff renders a checkbox per hunk, keyed by the
 * server-computed hunk id, and the row wears an `N of M hunks` badge when only
 * part of it will land. The election is persisted by the host (the draft's
 * selection) — this component owns the controls and their responder wiring,
 * `DiffBlock` only paints the slot ([D05]).
 *
 * Laws: [L02] diff stores enter React through `useSyncExternalStore`;
 * [L06] status tones, hover affordances, and the partial-landing mark paint
 * via CSS, never React state; [L11] the hunk checkboxes dispatch `toggle`
 * through a `useResponderForm` scope this module owns; [L26] the diff body
 * collapses by unmount.
