/**
 * `useFileTipPortals` — a confirmed path in prose gets the app's file hover.
 *
 * The last of the three entity kinds to be answered in the app's own bubble.
 * A commit run got {@link useCommitTipPortals}, a session run got the live
 * citation chip, and a path run got nothing at all: an underline saying it
 * could be opened, and no way to see the whole of what would open. A path in
 * prose is nearly always partial — the agents write a basename, or a repo
 * path with the root implied — so the one fact the ink cannot carry is the
 * one the hover exists to state.
 *
 * The technique is {@link useCommitTipPortals}'s, and so is its cost: the
 * annotator is a DOM pass, so the only way to mount a React component into a
 * run it marked is to empty the host and portal into it. **What goes back is
 * the run's own characters**, unchanged — a path is what the writer wrote,
 * and unlike a sha it has no uniform spelling to normalize toward. The tip
 * carries the resolved absolute path instead, which is the fact the prose
 * elided rather than a second version of what it said.
 *
 * **Emptying the host is not free here, and `dropStaleWraps` is why.** A path
 * wrap is re-checked every pass — a file can be deleted, and a link whose
 * file has stopped resolving should stop being a link — and that check reads
 * the element's own text. An emptied host would read as `""`, resolve to
 * nothing, and unwrap every path mark on the next verdict batch. So the words
 * are preserved on {@link FILE_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE} before the host is emptied,
 * and the re-check reads them from there, exactly as the session arm already
 * does with {@link SESSION_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE}.
 *
 * **Annotator wraps only.** The selector is scoped to
 * {@link WRAPPED_ATTRIBUTE}, because a self-stamping {@link TugAtomRef}
 * carries the same `file-path` annotation and is not a run of prose: it owns
 * its own tip already, and emptying it would throw away its glyph and label.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L03] collection runs in the block's layout effect, before paint.
 *  - [L06] nothing here is appearance state — the hosts are IDENTITY (which
 *    element, which path); how the bubble looks is the tooltip's business.
 *  - [L27] `onAnnotated` is a registration and hands back its release.
