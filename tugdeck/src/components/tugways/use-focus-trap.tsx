/**
 * useFocusTrap -- push a CFRunLoop-style focus mode while a floating surface is
 * open, and restore the prior key view when it closes.
 *
 * A floating surface (sheet, alert, popover, menu) calls this and wraps its
 * content in the returned `FocusModeScope`. While `active`, a trapped focus
 * mode is current: the Tab walk services only focusables registered in this
 * mode ([#cfrunloop-model]), so Tab cycles within the surface; on close the
 * FocusManager restores the key view that was current when the mode was pushed.
 * Descendant `useFocusable` callers read the scope id from `FocusModeContext`
 * (provided by `FocusModeScope`) and register into this mode automatically.
 *
 * This is the engine-side trap. It is additive to a surface's existing Radix
 * `FocusScope` (which traps DOM focus) — the taming steps later remove Radix
 * per surface and let this be the sole trap. Until then the two coexist: with
 * no focusables registered in the mode yet, the engine Tab walk falls through
 * to native Tab, which Radix traps; the engine mode contributes the scope id,
 * the `data-focus-mode` projection, and key-view restore.
 *
 * Registration rides `useLayoutEffect` ([L03]) so the mode is pushed before any
 * keyboard handler that walks it can fire. Tolerant of no provider (the hook
 * no-ops outside a `FocusManagerProvider`, like `useOptionalResponder`).
