/**
 * TugActionTooltip — a tooltip that names a control's action and its chord.
 *
 * The pairing a control deserves when it duplicates a keyboard shortcut: a
 * phrase saying what the control does, and beside it the chord that does the
 * same thing without the mouse. The phrase is authored at the call site; the
 * chord is never authored anywhere — it is read from the keymap registry
 * through `commandShortcut`, the single renderer for a displayed shortcut
 * ([P11]).
 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole point. A hand-written "⌃⌘M" in a tooltip is a
 * second statement of a fact the command table already holds, and it has
 * nothing to disagree with until a reader believes it — which is how a context
 * menu came to advertise ⇧⌘C for a command bound to ⌥⇧⌘C. Once chords are the
 * user's to rebind, an authored string is not merely at risk of being wrong;
 * it is guaranteed wrong for anyone who rebinds.
 *
 * So this component subscribes to the registry with `useSyncExternalStore`
 * ([L02]) and re-renders when a binding changes. Rebind Auto-Message in
 * Settings and the composer's tooltip says the new chord on its next hover —
 * no reload, no second source of truth.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <TugActionTooltip action={TUG_ACTIONS.COMMIT_AUTO_MESSAGE} content="Generate a commit message">
 *   <TugPushButton subtype="icon" onClick={draft} icon={<Wand />} />
 * </TugActionTooltip>
 * ```
 *
 * A command with no binding renders the phrase alone — the same bubble, minus
 * the chip. A control is therefore free to use this wrapper before its command
 * has a chord, and it gains the chip the day one is assigned.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] external state via useSyncExternalStore,
 *       [L11] controls emit actions; responders handle actions,
 *       [L16] pairings declared (inherited — renders TugTooltip's bubble),
 *       [L19] component authoring guide
