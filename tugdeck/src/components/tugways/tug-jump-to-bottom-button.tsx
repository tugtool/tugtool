/**
 * tug-jump-to-bottom-button.tsx — round "scroll to latest" affordance for a
 * transcript that follows its own live edge.
 *
 * Floats over the scrollport, pinned bottom-center, and is shown only while
 * the reader has scrolled away from the live edge. Modeled on the down-arrow
 * button chat clients surface when the conversation is scrolled up.
 *
 * Card-agnostic: the Session card's transcript and the Gazette's column both
 * mount it, and neither owns it. What a host supplies is the positioned
 * ancestor it floats in, the click that jumps, and the attribute that shows
 * it — nothing about the button knows which transcript it is over.
 *
 * **Visibility is appearance state.** The host toggles a `data-visible`
 * attribute on the button — written from whatever its own follow-bottom
 * observer is — and CSS fades it in / out ([L06]). The component itself holds
 * no state and never re-renders for the show / hide.
 *
 * **Mount discipline.** A host renders this unconditionally, never mounting it
 * behind a condition, so the show / hide is a pure CSS transition with no
 * React reconciliation ([L26]).
