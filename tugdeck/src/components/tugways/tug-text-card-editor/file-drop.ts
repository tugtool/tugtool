/**
 * file-drop — drop a file on a Text card and get a markdown link to it.
 *
 * The bytes are copied into an `assets/` folder beside the document being
 * edited and a standard CommonMark link is inserted at the drop caret:
 * `![stem](assets/photo.png)` for an image, `[name](assets/notes.zip)` for
 * anything else. Nothing about the result is Tug-specific — GitHub, pandoc,
 * Obsidian, and `cat` all agree on what the document means afterwards, which
 * is exactly what a database-backed link or an app-scheme URL would cost.
 *
 * The link's visible half is always the name the user dropped. Where the file
 * had to land under a different one — a collision suffix — that stays in the
 * destination, which is the half that has to name a real file. How this
 * feature keeps two files with one name apart is its own business, and a
 * document that suddenly says `photo-2` about a picture the user knows as
 * `photo` is that bookkeeping leaking into their prose.
 *
 * The insertion is an ordinary edit. Dirty state, autosave, aside
 * crash-safety, and undo all apply unchanged; one undo removes the links.
 * The asset files stay — the same as any other file the user put in their own
 * directory, visible in `git status` and theirs to delete.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * No widget, no inline rendering, no preview. The Text card is a raw-source
 * editor and the link stays visible as source, styled by the editor's own
 * markdown tokens. This extension takes the drop caret from the composer's
 * substrate ({@link tugDropCaretExtension}) and nothing else from it: no
 * atoms, no bytes-store, no downsample. A document attachment is a file, not
 * a payload.
 *
 * ## Every document has somewhere to put a file
 *
 * There is no untitled guard. A buffer that has never been saved carries a
 * draft id, and a draft id names a real writable home under the Tug data root
 * — so the drop writes `assets/<name>` there and the document says exactly
 * what it will say after it is saved. Save As migrates the home into the
 * destination directory, and because the relative link is stable across that
 * move, the document text usually does not change at all.
 *
 * Saving a *titled* document elsewhere by any other means breaks its links the
 * way any `mv` would; that is the standard cost of relative links and is not
 * guarded here.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] the drop ring and caret are DOM/CSS — a `data-drop-active`
 *    attribute on the host and the caret layer, never React state.
 *  - [L07] the document path and error sink are read through getters at
 *    dispatch time, never captured at extension-construction time.

 * dropping a second `photo.png` writes `assets/photo-2.png`, and the link
 * reads `![photo](assets/photo-2.png)`. Suffixing is bookkeeping this feature
 * does to avoid clobbering a file — it is not something the user did, and the
 * visible half of the link is the half they read. Only the destination, which
 * has to name a real file, carries the suffix.
 *
 * The image's alt text is the dropped filename's stem — what a person would
