/**
 * The sidecar geometry for a document copy.
 *
 * The payload schema is *positional* — one U+FFFC in `text` per atom entry —
 * and a markdown link is a *range* of literal text. Making those two shapes
 * meet is where this can go wrong, and getting it wrong is not a crash: it
 * plants atom widgets over literal markup in the prompt entry, or drops an
 * attachment on the floor. So the geometry is pinned here, purely.
 *
 * The paste half does real file I/O (read the original through the blob route,
 * write it into the destination's `assets/`) and is verified against a running
 * app rather than here — there is no way to exercise it in a pure test without
 * hand-rolling the very interfaces it exists to drive.
