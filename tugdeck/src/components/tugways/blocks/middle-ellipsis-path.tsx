/**
 * `MiddleEllipsisPath` — shared header path renderer for tool blocks.
 *
 * A file path rendered with a *middle* ellipsis: the head segment
 * shrinks and ellipsizes from its trailing edge while a fixed-length
 * tail (the filename plus a little of its directory) stays pinned, so
 * a long path collapses as `/Users/koci…RTY_NOTICES.md` rather than
 * end-truncating away the filename or growing a scrollbar.
 *
 * The truncation itself is `TugPath`'s — the same mechanism the document
 * masthead's path line wears, authored once, splitting at the last separator
 * so the whole filename is pinned. What this adds is the tool block's own:
 * the `<code>` slot and mono face, transcript Find, and the tooltip.
 *
 * A hover tooltip surfaces the full path. By default (`tip="path"`) it opens
 * only when the path is actually clipped: `TugTooltip`'s `suppressOpen` gate
 * runs `pathTooltipSuppressed` on each hover, which compares the head's
 * `scrollWidth` against its `clientWidth`. A row that NAMES a file rather
 * than heading one passes `tip="file"` and gets the house file hover instead
 * — the same `fileTip` bubble the commit receipt's roster wears.
 *
 * Per [#bk-conformance] item 8 this is THE path-truncation pattern for
 * tool-block headers. `ReadToolBlock` and `EditToolBlock` both
 * compose it; a new tool block with a `Tool · {path}` header should too,
 * rather than composing `TugPath` directly and re-deriving the tail
 * length, the slot, and the tooltip around it.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] no React state — the truncation is pure CSS; the tooltip's
 *    open/closed state lives in `TugTooltip`'s own DOM-driven
 *    machinery, not here.
 *  - [L19] file pair (`.tsx` + `.css`). The component carries no
 *    `data-slot` of its own — it is a header fragment, and the
 *    `<code data-slot="tool-block-path">` it renders is the slot.
 *  - [L20] consumes only `--tugx-block-*` (inherited from the
 *    composing chrome) and introduces no tokens.

 * mid-word: a 20-char tail turns `…/tug-text-editor-selection-suppress.test.ts`
 * into `ion-suppress.test.ts` and then clips THAT, so the row truncates twice
 * and names nothing. A ragged right edge is a cosmetic cost; an unreadable
 * filename defeats the list.
