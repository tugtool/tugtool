/**
 * `BlockChrome` — shared header/footer frame around Layer-2
 * tool blocks.
 *
 * Per [D05]'s two-layer hybrid architecture and [Spec S03]'s
 * tool-block contract, every per-tool block composes:
 *
 *   1. A chrome frame (this component) — header (icon + tool name +
 *      args summary), optional footer (badges), optional inline
 *      caution badge, status-aware styling. Token vocabulary:
 *      `--tugx-block-*`.
 *   2. A body kind — `TerminalBlock`, `DiffBlock`, `FileBlock`, etc.
 *      Token vocabulary: `--tugx-{term,diff,file,…}-*`.
 *
 * The chrome's job is to give every tool a consistent frame so the
 * user can scan the transcript and spot tool calls at a glance.
 * Per-tool blocks handle the body composition and the
 * tool-specific bits (e.g., the shell-syntax-highlighted command on
 * `BashToolBlock`).
 *
 * Status states map to the [Spec S03] `ToolBlockStatus` enum. The
 * header's lifecycle dot is the single status signal (the Quiet Line) —
 * there is no stripe; the chrome frame is uniform across states:
 *
 *   - `streaming` — the tool input is partial; the wrapper passes an
 *     empty body (`null`) into `children`. The header dot pulses
 *     in-flight — the single streaming signal ([D02]). (The Agent
 *     block fills the window with real child blocks as they stream.)
 *   - `ready`    — steady-state render. The dot reads success.
 *   - `error`    — `tool_result.is_error === true`. The header's
 *     lifecycle dot reads danger; everything else (name, result, body)
 *     stays neutral — the dot is the only red. Consumers pass a `notice`
 *     (tone `error`) so the failure is readable WITHOUT expanding.
 *
 * ## Notice band — collapse-independent explanation
 *
 * Between the header and the body the chrome renders an optional
 * {@link BlockNoticeBand} from the `notice` prop. Unlike the body it
 * sits OUTSIDE the collapse guard, so a one-to-three-line explanation
 * (a failed command's first error line, a warning, an info note) stays
 * visible while collapsed — the common case for transcript history. It is
 * general, not error-only: the tone selects the icon. The full detail still
 * lives in the body, one expand away.
 *
 * `caution` is rendered as an inline `SessionCautionBadge` in the header
 * per [D04] / [Q03] — three reasons surface: `unknown_tool`,
 * `unknown_shape`, `version_drift`. The chrome owns only the
 * placement; the chip is `chrome/session-caution-badge.tsx`.
 *
 * ## Actions slot — body-kind affordance host
 *
 * The chrome's header carries an actions target at its trailing edge:
 * `<div data-slot="tool-block-actions">`. It is exposed to descendants
 * via the `ChromeActionsTargetContext` so a body kind composed inside
 * (under `embedded={true}`) can `createPortal` its resting affordances
 * (Find trigger, Copy, view-mode toggle, fold cue) into the chrome header
 * itself. Per [L20] the chrome owns only the SLOT (a placeholder div with
 * layout-only styling); the affordances inside the slot are React-rendered
 * by the body kind and carry the body kind's tokens. Standalone callers
 * (gallery, RenderInput-routed) get a null context value and render
 * affordances in their own identity header.
 *
 * Why a portal and not a `headerActions` prop: the affordance state
 * (find session, view-mode toggle, fold collapsed-set) is owned by the
 * body kind. Hoisting that state to the wrapper level so the wrapper
 * could pass `headerActions` would invert the data flow and require
 * every wrapper to re-implement the affordance UI. The portal lets the
 * body kind keep all state local while still placing the rendered
 * affordance node inside the chrome's header in the DOM tree — exactly
 * where it needs to sit for layout, sticky-pin coverage, and accessibility.
 *
 * ## Copy — for `body-bits/` wrappers
 *
 * Body-bits wrappers (`SkillToolBlock`, `MonitorToolBlock`,
 * `WorktreeToolBlock`, `TaskMgmtToolBlock`) don't compose an embedded
 * body kind. They pass `copyText` so the HEADER's built-in Copy writes
 * their tailored payload; folding is the header's whole-block chevron
 * (every block is collapsible), so they need nothing else.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] all visible state lives on data attributes / class
 *    swaps; the chrome never renders prose into React state.
 *  - [L19] component-authoring guide — `.tsx` + `.css` pair,
 *    module docstring, exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot="tool-block-chrome"` on the root.
 *  - [L20] component-token sovereignty — the chrome owns the
 *    `--tugx-block-*` slot family. Body kinds composed inside
 *    keep their own `--tugx-{kind}-*` tokens; chrome rules never
 *    reach into them.
