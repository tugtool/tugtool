/**
 * Entity tips — what hovering a commit, a session, or a file says.
 *
 * An entity can be pointed at from many places: a sha appears in transcript
 * prose, in a History row, on a receipt, in a Gazette ref. Before this module
 * each of those surfaces answered the hover its own way, so the same commit
 * described itself five different ways depending on which one you happened to
 * be looking at — and four of those answers were the OS `title` attribute,
 * which is not a surface we can theme, delay, or dismiss.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to hold: **one hover answer per entity kind,
 * wherever it is pointed at.** A builder here returns the `content` for a
 * {@link TugTooltip} with `variant="entity"`; the skeleton it fills is in
 * `entity-tips.css`, and the words it uses for a commit's shape come from
 * `lib/commit-format` so the hover and the badges beside it agree.
 *
 * The shape is the same for all three, because it is the order a reader
 * needs: **what it is** (the title row), **what is true of it** (meta rows),
 * then **what it touched** (the shape line and roster, commits only).
 *
 * Pure presentation: the builders take facts and return nodes. Resolving a
 * sha or an id to those facts is the caller's job.
 *
 * @module components/tugways/entity-tips
