/**
 * useCycleMode — the keyboard-focus-cycling mode primitive a text-first card
 * opts into ([P09]/[P10] of the focus-language rollout).
 *
 * A text-first card's resting key view is its editor, which owns Tab
 * (completion / indent). Cycling mode frees Tab to circulate the card's chrome
 * zones instead: it pushes a **trapped** engine focus mode whose members are the
 * card's cycle stops, seeds the key view on the first stop (the commit-home, by
 * authored order), and — on toggle again or an explicit exit — pops the mode,
 * restoring the key view the engine captured when the mode was pushed (the
 * editor caret). Tab walks only the cycle stops while the mode is current and
 * wraps within them ([#cfrunloop-model] trapped mode + `advance`'s modular
 * wrap); the editor is in the base mode and is untouched until restore.
 *
 * This is the general mechanism (the session card is the first consumer). It adds no
 * new engine projection — it drives the existing focus-mode stack
 * (`pushFocusMode` / `popFocusMode` / `focusFirstInMode` / `focusKeyView`), so
 * it is the [P04] behavior carve-out via [P09], appearance untouched.
 *
 * Wiring (the consumer's responsibilities):
 *   - register the toggle on a key-card responder for `CYCLE_FOCUS_MODE`
 *     (`{ [TUG_ACTIONS.CYCLE_FOCUS_MODE]: () => toggle() }`), so ⌥⇥ reaches it;
 *   - wrap the cycle-able zones in the returned `CycleScope` so their
 *     `useFocusable` callers register into this mode (they must also set a
 *     `focusGroup` to register at all);
 *   - order the stops so the **commit-home is the lowest `focusOrder`** — it is
 *     what `focusFirstInMode` seeds on entry ([P10]).
 *
 * Laws: [L02] `cycling` is derived from the engine via `useSyncExternalStore`
 *       (the focus-mode stack is the single source of truth — no parallel React
 *       state to desync); [L22] the mode is mutated imperatively on the manager;
 *       [L03] mount cleanup pops the mode in a layout effect; [L26] `CycleScope`
 *       holds a constant function identity so children never remount.
