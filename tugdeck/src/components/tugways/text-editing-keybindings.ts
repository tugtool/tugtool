/**
 * text-editing-keybindings.ts -- Substrate-local registry of the
 * gap-fill text-editing keybindings.
 *
 * Scope: this registry is consumed by the text-editing substrates
 * themselves (`useTextInputResponder` for native `<input>` /
 * `<textarea>`; the CM6 keymap layer for `tug-text-editor`). It is
 * NOT consumed by the global `keybinding-map.ts` capture-phase
 * pipeline. Movement and deletion only ever target the focused text
 * input, so the chain abstraction adds nothing here — see [DM01] in
 * `tugplan-text-editing-keybindings.md` for the rationale, and
 * `keybinding-map.ts` for the cross-substrate semantics that *do*
 * belong on the global pipeline (Cmd-A, Cmd-W, Cmd-T, Cmd-1..9, etc.).
 *
 * Why a separate module: the registry is the data layer a future
 * settings UI for keybinding remap will read and write. Per [DM06],
 * the export shape (`let EDITING_KEYBINDINGS` plus a
 * `setEditingKeybindings(next)` setter) is laid out so a future plan
 * can ship the dialog as a mechanical edit. The substrate hooks read
 * the registry at keystroke time (via `matchEditingKeybinding`),
 * never at mount time, so a runtime remap takes effect on the next
 * keystroke — mirrors [L07]'s "read config at call time."
 *
 * What this registers: only the four "gap" bindings that fall through
 * AppKit's field editor (for native inputs) and CodeMirror's
 * `defaultKeymap` (for the editor) today. Per [DM02], the
 * platform-handled bindings (Ctrl-A/E/F/B/P/N/D/H/K/T, Option-Delete)
 * are NOT in this registry — adding dead names for already-handled
 * keystrokes would create reviewer confusion without earning
 * anything. The audit table in
 * `tugplan-text-editing-keybindings.md` is the documentation; this
 * registry is for live bindings only.
 *
 * Shape: `EditingKeybinding` mirrors `KeyBinding` in
 * `keybinding-map.ts` but without `preventDefaultOnMatch`, `value`,
 * and `scope` (none of which apply to substrate-local editing
 * dispatch). It adds `shiftExtends`: when true, the matcher accepts
 * the keystroke regardless of `event.shiftKey`, and the substrate
 * handler reads `shiftKey` separately to decide motion-vs-selection
 * per [DM05]. Without `shiftExtends`, the matcher demands an exact
 * shift match.
