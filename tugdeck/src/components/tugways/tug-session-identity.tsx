/**
 * TugSessionIdentity — one session, rendered at a declared density tier.
 *
 * Takes a resolved identity record and a tier, never a format string. Two
 * registers fall out of the tier rather than being chosen: the `chip` tier is
 * a CITATION — a surface referring to a session from foreign context — and
 * wears the session atom, a rounded pill. The `line` tier is PRESENCE — a
 * surface that IS the session — and wears the same identity as bare
 * typography, because on a surface that is the thing, an enclosure reads as a
 * link to it somewhere else.
 *
 * **The mark is a live pulsing dot, and it is the same mark on both registers.**
 * It says what the session is *doing* rather than what kind of thing it is,
 * which is the one thing a static glyph could never do — and it is why the
 * chatbox icon is gone rather than sitting beside it. The dot reads
 * {@link useSessionPhase}, so a session with no reachable live state shows a
 * quiet idle dot rather than a red one.
 *
 * **The title is two runs, not one.** The user's own name leads, then a quieter
 * ` : <project>/<callsign>` ({@link sessionTitleParts}). Which run gives way
 * under a width squeeze depends on the register, and both rules are the
 * gallery's: on a title surface (the line tier) the callsign is the permanent
 * citable handle the reader scans a list by, so it survives and the name
 * elides; on the atom (the chip tier) the user's own words survive and the
 * minted handle elides — the tooltip and every copy path still carry it whole.
 * A session with no name renders the bare `<project>/<callsign>`, which may
 * then elide since it is the only run there is. The `project/` prefix rides
 * the callsign run — the project a session works against is how a reader
 * places it — and a session with no known project degrades to the callsign
 * alone.
 *
 * **The atom paints in text ink.** The pill's run and border take the ordinary
 * text color and a `currentcolor` mix; the dot is its only color channel,
 * because a colored pill around a colored dot was two tints saying one thing.
 *
 * The chip's hover carries the full identity and the citation as a
 * `TugTooltip`, not a placard: `TugTooltip` is explicitly non-interactive and
 * evaporates on any deliberate action, so a button inside one would be
 * unreachable. The acting surface is a right-click instead — the idiom every
 * other Tug chip already uses — and it is the session's whole menu
 * ({@link useSessionIdentityMenu}), not a lone Copy: how to reach the session
 * (Show it, or Resume it where no card holds it), then the two forms the chip
 * can travel as. **Copy as Atom** writes the citation as plain text with the
 * `dev.tug.prompt-atoms` sidecar beside it, so a paste back into a Tug surface
 * returns the chip; **Copy as Citation** writes the flat string alone, for
 * anywhere outside Tug. Both are menu items and neither is a chord: ⌘C is
 * the app's Copy, and what it copies is what the reader selected. The
 * masthead's telemetry placard carries the same citation on a
 * `TugCopyBadge` for a click path.
 *
 * An unresolvable citation keeps its shape — the reader still needs to know
 * what kind of thing is named — takes a dashed border and muted ink, forces its
 * dot to idle, and is fully inert. With the icon gone there is nothing left to
 * slash, so shape alone states the failure, which it already did alongside the
 * slash. Liveness is never a property of a reference: sessions are never dead,
 * only unfindable.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the dot's phase enters through `useSyncExternalStore`;
 *       [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM, never React state; [L13] motion belongs
 *       to the indicator; [L16] every foreground rule declares its surface;
 *       [L19] component authoring guide; [L20] token sovereignty — composed
 *       children keep their own tokens.
 * Decisions: [D123] one name, produced in one place.

 * A citation chip resolved from a session **id** — the shape every foreign
 * surface wants.
 *
 * The Gazette's refs, the Changes card's orphan hint, and the History card's
 * commit line all hold an id and nothing else, and all three have to answer
 * the same question before they can render: does the ledger hold that session?
 * Answering it three times would mean three answers, so it is answered once,
 * here — and it is answered by the **ledger**, over `resolve_sessions`, rather
 * than by whatever this run's caches happened to accumulate. A commit's chip
 * must not be resolvable or slashed depending on whether the picker was opened.
 *
 * Three renderings, one per state of that answer:
 *
 * - **Resolved** — the atom with its live dot, the ledger's own callsign, and
 *   the caller's click intent live.
 * - **Unresolvable** — the dashed inert atom with a forced idle dot, still
 *   showing whatever callsign the commit recorded (`recordedTag`), because a
 *   reference that cannot be followed is more useful naming what it named than
 *   showing a bare hash. Note what this does NOT test: liveness. A closed
 *   session resolves; a commit from another machine does not. Sessions are never
 *   dead, only unfindable.
 * - **Pending** — the round trip is in flight. Inert, and *not* dashed:
 *   claiming "not found" before asking would be the same lie in the other
 *   direction, and the chip is unclickable until it knows where a click goes.
 *
 * **The click is this component's, not the caller's.** Every citation means the
 * same thing by a click — raise the card showing that session — so the gesture
 * lives here rather than being re-passed by each surface, and it is *offered*
 * only when there is a card to raise. A resolved session with no card open is a
 * real and ordinary state; a chip that looked clickable and did nothing in it
 * would be the failure the Gazette's disabled refs were written to avoid.
