/**
 * TugTextEditor — CodeMirror 6-backed text editing substrate.
 *
 * The lower-level editing primitive that backs higher-level tug
 * components. Built on an `EditorView` from CodeMirror 6: the
 * React shell owns mount and dispose, observes via
 * `EditorView.updateListener`, and exposes an imperative delegate
 * via `ref`.
 *
 * Owns the document, caret, selection, and embedded atoms — the state
 * that editing actions (cut, copy, paste, selectAll, undo, redo,
 * insertAtom, submit) mutate. Per [L11], `TugTextEditor` is the responder
 * that registers handlers for those actions on its owned state. The
 * responder registration is what binds Cmd-A / Cmd-C / Cmd-X / Cmd-V
 * / Cmd-Z / Cmd-Shift-Z to the editor: those keystrokes are routed
 * through the document-level capture-phase pipeline in
 * `responder-chain-provider.tsx`, which calls `preventDefault` for
 * every match (`preventDefaultOnMatch`) so the browser's native
 * handling is suppressed and the responder chain owns the semantics.
 * Without responder registration the suppressed default leaves the
 * keystrokes inert — CM6's own keymap never sees them because
 * `event.defaultPrevented` is already true by the time the event
 * reaches `contentDOM`.
 *
 * Laws: [L01] one root.render() at mount; CM6 manages its own DOM
 *        tree internally and is never re-rendered through React,
 *        [L02] atom segments, decoration set, keymap policy, and
 *        typeahead state live in CM6 (StateField + closure-captured
 *        refs), never in React state, [L03] mount, dispose, the
 *        keymap-config mirror, the completion-providers mirror,
 *        and the typeahead state subscription run in
 *        `useLayoutEffect`, [L04] popup position is read from CM6
 *        via `coordsAtPos`, never via React-state-driven layout,
 *        [L06] all editor appearance — including the typeahead
 *        popup body — flows through CSS and direct DOM, never
 *        React state, [L07] delegate methods, keymap handlers, the
 *        completion provider thunk, and the typeahead-change
 *        observer ref read their state at call time, [L11]
 *        responder for editing actions (including atom insert /
 *        clipboard / submit / history-nav) on the owned document,
 *        selection, atom set, and typeahead session — popup items
 *        dispatch directly into the substrate's accept helper
 *        because the popup is a substrate-internal UI surface,
 *        [L15] token-driven control states, [L19] component
 *        authoring guide, [L20] popup uses
 *        `tug-completion-menu`'s own tokens — no token-slot
 *        violations, [L21] CodeMirror 6 (MIT) — see
 *        `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, [L22] theme-change subscription,
 *        typeahead state observer, and async completion-provider
 *        results all stream through CM6 transactions and direct
 *        DOM updates — never through React state, [L24] `viewRef`,
 *        `hostRef`, `popupRef`, `keymapConfigRef`,
 *        `completionProvidersRef` are local-data refs; CM6 owns
 *        document, selection, atom-decoration, and typeahead
 *        state; appearance via CSS / DOM.
 *
 * StrictMode lifecycle: the `EditorView` is constructed inside a
 * `useLayoutEffect` with empty deps, stored on `viewRef`, and
 * disposed in the cleanup. React 19 StrictMode runs mount →
 * cleanup → mount in dev; each pass constructs a fresh view, the
 * prior cleanup destroys the prior view, and `viewRef.current`
 * is `null` between passes so callers see `view() === null`
 * rather than a destroyed view. Pattern matches the standard CM6
 * + React integration used by `@uiw/react-codemirror` and similar
 * wrappers.

// Compartments let the React shell reconfigure individual extensions

// because CM6 identifies a Compartment by reference — the shell
// dispatches `compartment.reconfigure(newExt)` whenever the
// corresponding prop changes, and CM6 swaps the Compartment's contents
// in place. The view, the document, the selection, the history, and
// every other extension are untouched.
//
// Why module-scope, not per-instance: a Compartment's identity is the
// reference itself; dispatching `reconfigure(...)` on a Compartment
// the view doesn't carry is a no-op. Module-scope means every
// `TugTextEditor` mount uses the same Compartment identities — the
// `buildExtensions` call wraps each one for that particular view
// when the view is constructed, and subsequent `useLayoutEffect`
// passes can reach into the live view and reconfigure.
//
// `Compartment.of(initial)` returns the wrapped extension; we feed
// the initial prop values at view-construction time inside
// `buildExtensions`, then use `compartment.reconfigure(next)` from
// effects on prop change.

/**
 * Reconfigurable geometry-revision marker.
 *
 * Holds an empty `EditorView.theme({})` extension whose contributed
 * style-module identity changes every time a prop-response
 * `useLayoutEffect` reconfigures it. The compartment exists solely
 * to bridge the gap between two state systems:
 *
 *   1. Geometry-affecting props change rendered metrics through
 *      paths CM6 doesn't observe natively:
 *        - **Typography props** (`fontFamily`, `fontSize`,
 *          `lineHeight`, `letterSpacing`) flow through CSS custom
 *          properties on the host wrapper and propagate via
 *          inheritance into `.cm-content`. The browser re-flows
 *          on its own when these change.
 *        - **`lineNumbers`** toggling adds or removes the
 *          line-number gutter, changing the scroller's
 *          clientWidth (and through it the contentDOM's
 *          available width) — affecting per-line wrap counts.
 *        - **`lineWrap`** toggling changes whether `.cm-content`
 *          wraps overflow at all, directly altering per-line
 *          heights for any line that previously overflowed.
 *   2. CodeMirror 6 maintains a private `heightOracle` cache of
 *      the editor's default line-height (read once via
 *      `getComputedStyle` of `.cm-content`) plus per-line height
 *      measurements in its `heightMap`. Gutter row heights,
 *      scroll geometry, and viewport calculations all read from
 *      these caches. CM6 does NOT observe CSS-variable changes
 *      or geometry shifts induced by sibling-extension toggling;
 *      its private `mustMeasureContent` flag is what tells the
 *      next measure pass to re-read computed styles and
 *      per-line rects into the oracle and heightMap.
 *
 * The decisive trigger for that flag — confirmed empirically and
 * by reading CM6's source (`view.update` ~ line 7962 of
 * `@codemirror/view/dist/index.js`) — is:
 *
 *     if (update.startState.facet(theme) != update.state.facet(theme))
 *       this.viewState.mustMeasureContent = true;
 *
 * Each call to `EditorView.theme(spec)` mints a fresh prefix via
 * `StyleModule.newName()` and contributes that prefix string to
 * the `theme` facet. Reconfiguring this compartment with a
 * freshly-built (even empty) `EditorView.theme({})` produces a
 * new prefix → the `theme` facet's resolved value differs by
 * reference → `mustMeasureContent` flips → the next measure
 * pass calls `heightOracle.refresh(...)` against the
 * now-current computed line-height → the heightMap rebuilds
 * with the new oracle values → the gutter plugin picks up the
 * fresh row heights on the post-measure update.
 *
 * No CSS rules go through this theme — its `spec` is `{}`. We
 * don't want it to influence visual rendering; the marker's
 * identity (the per-call prefix) is what CM6 compares, not its
 * stylistic content. The real theme rules live in `tugTheme`
 * from `theme.ts`, which stays as a static extension.
 *
 * Other paths considered and rejected by the trace in
 * `typography-diag.ts`:
 *
 *   - Empty `view.dispatch({})` and `selection: state.selection`:
 *     produce transactions with no facet diff. `mustMeasureContent`
 *     stays false; the measure pass skips the refresh branch.
 *   - `lineNumbersCompartment.reconfigure(tugLineNumbersGutter)`: same
 *     shape — touches the gutter facet but not the theme facet.
 *   - `EditorView.contentAttributes.of({})` reconfigure: CM6
 *     compares `contentAttributes` between updates inside
 *     `viewState.update` (different code path), but
 *     `mustMeasureContent` is set only on the `theme` facet diff.
 *     Confirmed via the trace: the contentAttributes-reconfigure
 *     dispatch fired but produced `heightChanged: false`.
 *
 * Without this bridge, CSS-variable typography changes are
 * invisible to CM6 until the next "real" trigger (the user types
 * a character, scrolls, or the window resizes) — which is the
 * latency the user reported as "I have to click+type to see the
 * gutter update."

      // against the now-current computed line-height → the

 * `CompletionOverlay` — portaled shell for the typeahead popup.
 *
 * Renders one `<div data-slot="tug-completion-menu">` into
 * `<CanvasOverlayRoot />` via `createPortal` (or `document.body` as
 * fallback when no root is registered, per [D02]). The popup `<div>`
 * is `position: fixed` and `z-index: var(--tug-z-overlay-popup)` so
 * it escapes every pane's `overflow: hidden` and sits visually above
 * the entire pane tree.
 *
 * The popup `<div>` exists in the DOM whenever this component is
 * mounted (i.e., whenever the parent editor has a live view). The
 * painter writes `display: none` when typeahead is inactive and
 * `display: block` when active. We do not conditionally mount the
 * portal on the active boolean because:
 *   - The popup div is DOM-cheap (one empty element).
 *   - Always-mounted means a stable popup ref for the painter; no
 *     gap between "view ready" and "popup div ready" the painter has
 *     to coordinate around.
 *   - Toggling display is what the today's painter already does on
 *     state change; the migration preserves that semantics rather
 *     than introducing a new mount/unmount path.
 *
 * ## Subscriptions
 *
 * Three subscribers, all wired in this component's `useLayoutEffect`:
 *
 *   1. **Paint subscriber** — direct `subscribeCompletionState(view, …)`
 *      callback that runs `paintCompletionPopup(view, popup, direction)`
 *      and forwards to `onTypeaheadChangeRef.current`. Appearance-zone
 *      writes; per [L22] this is direct-DOM, never round-tripped
 *      through React state.
 *
 *   2. **ResizeObserver re-anchor + pane-collapse cancel** — observes
 *      the editor host element. On every observed resize:
 *        - if the host has collapsed to zero size (`offsetHeight === 0`
 *          or `offsetWidth === 0`), the holding pane has collapsed —
 *          dispatch `cancelCompletion(view)` and skip the re-anchor
 *          (no anchor exists when the editor is unrendered);
 *        - otherwise, fire the painter so the popup re-anchors.
 *      Catches sash-drag / pane-resize cases that don't fire window
 *      events and the pane-collapse path that would otherwise leave
 *      the popup orphaned. ([D06] pane-collapse fold-in.)
 *
 *   3. **Companion focus binding** — `useCompanionPopupBinding({
 *      ownerEl: view.contentDOM, onShouldDismiss: () =>
 *      cancelCompletion(view) })`. Observes DOM focus on the editor's
 *      contentDOM. When focus leaves the contentDOM subtree (Radix
 *      mounts a sibling popup and `FocusScope.onMountAutoFocus`
 *      grabs focus into it; the user clicks outside the editor; a
 *      peer card is activated and focus moves to it), dispatches
 *      `cancelCompletion(view)`. Per `tugplan-session-popup-bindings.md`
 *      [D05] (#companion-binding), this signal strict-supersets the
 *      former `cardDidDeactivate` subscription: every dismissal the
 *      old signal triggered, the focus signal also triggers, AND the
 *      focus signal additionally catches the in-card service-popup
 *      case (the "image 5" font-picker bug) that the old signal
 *      missed. The previous deck-manager / `cardDidDeactivate` /
 *      `useCardId` plumbing for this concern is gone.
 *
 * The component itself reads no React state and renders no React
 * children apart from the portaled wrapper — it is structure-zone
 * housekeeping (which DOM exists where) plus the appearance-zone
 * subscribers.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] state observation goes through the per-view subscriber
 *        set the completion-extension already exposes (no React state
 *        copy), [L03] subscriptions and observers register in
 *        `useLayoutEffect` before any user gesture can fire, [L06]
 *        popup body and position are direct DOM writes, [L07] the
 *        `onTypeaheadChange` prop and `direction` prop are read via
 *        refs so a re-render with new identities doesn't re-subscribe,
 *        [L11] `pointerdown` + `acceptCompletionAt` is substrate-internal
 *        (verified across portal detachment in tests/app-test/at0051,
 *        recorded in [D08]), [L22] high-frequency repaints are
 *        direct-DOM not React-state, [L23] typeahead state lives in
 *        CM6's `StateField` and survives this migration trivially.
