/**
 * `useCommitTipPortals` — a confirmed sha in prose gets the app's commit
 * hover, not the OS's.
 *
 * The annotator is a DOM pass: it can mark a run as a commit, and it cannot
 * mount a React component into it. That constraint is why the commit hover
 * was a `title` attribute for as long as it was — a plain string is the only
 * thing you can hand an element you did not render. The cost was that the
 * richest tooltip in the app was the one surface we could not theme, could
 * not delay, could not dismiss with the responder chain, and could not lay
 * out: an OS-drawn box in the system font, light in a dark theme.
 *
 * Portals bridge the two, exactly as {@link useSessionCitationPortals} does
 * for citation chips. The portal renders the commit's **mention label** —
 * `Commit <8ch>`, the same spelling every atom surface shows — wrapped in a
 * {@link TugTooltip} carrying {@link commitTip}. The spelling the prose used
 * is machine output, not authorship (git's short form lengthens with the
 * repository, so raw shas drift between 7 and 12 characters post to post);
 * it is preserved on {@link COMMIT_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE} for re-scan and unwrap,
 * and the reader sees one uniform, worded form. See
 * `tuglaws/entity-presentation.md`.
 *
 * **Emptying the host is safe here.** `dropStaleWraps` re-checks only the
 * kinds whose truth can change; a commit that resolved once stays resolved,
 * so a commit wrap is never unwrapped underneath us. The recorded text on
 * {@link COMMIT_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE} is therefore for idempotence across passes
 * (a re-walk finds an emptied span and must still know its words), not for
 * the restore path sessions need.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L03] collection runs in the block's layout effect, before paint.
 *  - [L06] nothing here is appearance state — the hosts are IDENTITY (which
 *    element, which sha); how the bubble looks is the tooltip's business.
 *  - [L27] `onAnnotated` is a registration and hands back its release.
