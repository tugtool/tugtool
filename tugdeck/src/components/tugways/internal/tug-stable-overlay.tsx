/**
 * TugStableOverlay — width/height-stabilizing overlay primitive.
 *
 * Stacks an `active` variant and one or more hidden `alternates` in a single
 * CSS-grid cell. The cell sizes to the max-content of every variant, so the
 * visible `active` paints while the alternates stay `visibility: hidden` but
 * still hold their footprint. The result: the box's intrinsic size is stable
 * across a swap between any of the variants — the smallest CSS primitive that
 * means "stack these and size to the widest/tallest."
 *
 * Shared by the controls that swap their face in place:
 *   - `TugButton` — label / icon-text-cluster swap (`widthStabilize`).
 *   - `TugBadge`  — two-line route-face swap (`widthStabilize`).
 *
 * Why grid, not absolute positioning: an absolutely-positioned alternate
 * leaves layout flow, so the cell would size to `active` only — defeating the
 * mechanism. Grid keeps every variant in flow at the same `grid-area`.
 *
 * ## High-water mark — re-stabilize larger, never shrink
 *
 * The declared variants set the *baseline* reservation. But a live `active`
 * value can exceed every alternate (an unanticipated label longer than the
 * sizers). When that happens the cell must **grow to fit and stay grown** — a
 * subsequent narrower value must not let it shrink back, or the box reflows on
 * the way down. So the overlay tracks the widest content it has ever held and
 * pins a `min-width` to it (monotonic). The reservation only ever increases:
 * stabilization that re-stabilizes larger ex-post-facto. Pure DOM — a
 * `ResizeObserver` measures and a `min-width` is written directly, no React
 * state ([L06] appearance via DOM, [L22] observe/mutate without a render).
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM, [L19] file pair, [L20] owns only its own
 * layout box — the variants it wraps keep their own tokens.
