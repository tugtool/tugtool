/**
 * list-view-striping.ts — pure resolution of `TugListView`'s `rowStriping`
 * prop into the CSS custom-property values the scroll container writes.
 *
 * Alternating row tint is the other way a dense list separates its rows: where
 * a divider draws a line BETWEEN rows, a stripe tints every other row, so the
 * list reads as banded without spending a pixel of height on rules. A row that
 * costs one line of text is easier to track across with a band than with a
 * hairline, which is the trade the BBEdit open-documents list makes.
 *
 * BOTH parities get a color. The obvious construction — leave one set of rows
 * on the host surface and wash the other — is wrong, and wrong in a way that
 * only shows up on short lists: it puts ONE step between adjacent rows, and a
 * step that small is legible only when it repeats. A ten-row list reads as
 * banded; a two-row list reads as two identical rows, because a single
 * transition gives the eye nothing to compare. Painting both parities puts a
 * step of twice the strength between any two neighbours and makes every row a
 * deliberate color, so two rows alternate as plainly as ten do.
 *
 * The two tints are the surface's own FOREGROUND and its own CONTENT SURFACE —
 * opposite directions by construction, whatever the theme. On the dark themes
 * the foreground is light and the content surface is dark; on the light themes
 * they swap. So one strength number moves the odd rows one way and the even
 * rows the other in all six themes, and no theme file declares a stripe color.
 *
 * A striped list stripes at ANY length. Two rows alternate, one row is the
 * first term of the alternation, and neither is special-cased away: a list's
 * row count changes constantly — files open and close, snippets come and go —
 * and a treatment that switches itself off below some threshold would mean the
 * list changes character under the user while they work.
 *
 * Kept out of the component so it is unit-testable with no DOM.
