/**
 * TugProgressSpinner — Internal building block for the classic 12-spoke spinner.
 *
 * App code should use {@link TugProgressIndicator} instead.
 *
 * Renders twelve radial capsule spokes around an empty center — the
 * familiar macOS-style indeterminate spinner. Each spoke fades from
 * full opacity to a quiet rest opacity over one cycle, staggered by
 * `(i / 12) * duration` so the "leading" (full-opacity) spoke walks
 * around the ring.
 *
 * State semantics:
 *   running   — staggered opacity walks around the ring.
 *   paused    — animation frozen mid-cycle.
 *   stopped   — every spoke at rest opacity (quiescent visible ring).
 *   completed — every spoke at full opacity.
 *   aborted   — same pose as stopped; the danger tint comes from the
 *               parent via `--tugx-progress-indicator-fill`.
 *
 * Geometry: each spoke is a capsule positioned vertically above the
 * center, from inner radius 24 to outer radius 48 on a 100-unit
 * square, emitted as percentages of the root box so the glyph scales
 * with `size`. Width 9. The inner radius leaves a small empty center;
 * spokes occupy most of the host radius so the glyph reads at parity
 * with the ring / pie variants at the same `size`.
 *
 * The spokes are HTML spans rather than SVG rects, and that is a
 * residency requirement, not a preference: an SVG interior element
 * never gets a compositing layer, so twelve SVG spokes meant twelve
 * perpetual main-thread opacity animations per visible spinner. A
 * capsule is exactly what a span with a full border-radius is. Each
 * spoke's placement rotation is a STATIC transform, which acceleration
 * does not object to — only the animated property set matters. Enforced
 * by `animationCensus()` in tugdeck/src/lib/perf-monitor.ts.
 *
 * Color is inherited from the parent's `--tugx-progress-indicator-fill`.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS, [L13] CSS keyframes only,
 *       [L16] pairings declared, [L19] component authoring guide
