/**
 * `usePositionStableClick` — preserve a click target's screen position
 * across state-driven layout changes that *do not change the document's
 * total height*.
 *
 * **Scope.** This hook handles cases where the click triggers a
 * layout reflow around the target but the scrollport's `scrollHeight`
 * is unchanged (or grows). Examples: a Find toggle that mounts a
 * find row, a view-mode swap that changes hunk grid layout, an icon
 * swap. The hook compensates by adjusting `scrollTop` so the
 * target's screen position is restored.
 *
 * **This hook does NOT handle collapsing fold cues.** When a fold cue
 * collapses a body, the document's `scrollHeight` shrinks. If the
 * user has scrolled past where the new `maxScrollTop` would be, the
 * browser clamps `scrollTop` — and no `scrollTop` write can move the
 * target back to its pre-click viewport Y, because the position we'd
 * need is past the end of the now-shorter document. The accepted
 * outcome is the natural browser clamp: the document is honestly
 * shorter, the viewport lands at the new bottom, the user re-scrolls
 * if they want to read what's still above. An earlier Phase E.3
 * experiment added a persistent ~80cqh tail spacer to absorb the
 * shrinkage (raising `maxScrollTop` enough that common-sized
 * collapses didn't clamp) but the spacer was always-visible empty
 * space in every transcript — a constant cost paid for a rare
 * benefit. The spacer was retired (Step 20.3.5 of
 * `roadmap/dev-assistant-turns.md`) and the natural clamp is the
 * current contract.
 *
 * The fix is purely imperative and lives entirely on the call-stack
 * of the click handler:
 *
 *   1. **Snapshot.** Read `target.getBoundingClientRect()` BEFORE the
 *      state mutation runs.
 *   2. **Flush.** Run the mutator inside `flushSync` so all React
 *      state updates the mutator triggers commit synchronously — by
 *      the time `flushSync` returns, the DOM is at its post-mutation
 *      layout.
 *   3. **Simple-delta compensation.** Measure the target's new
 *      viewport Y. If it shifted, write
 *      `scrollportRef.current.scrollTop += newTop - oldTop`. For
 *      buttons not inside a sticky ancestor (or sticky containers
 *      whose pin regime doesn't change), this fully restores the
 *      pre-click visual position.
 *   4. **Sticky-aware re-compensation.** Re-measure. If the button
 *      is STILL off by more than a tolerance, walk up to find the
 *      nearest `position: sticky` ancestor and compute the exact
 *      scrollTop that places it back at its pre-click viewport Y via
 *      the sticky positioning formula:
 *        - Natural regime (desired sticky Y > sticky top offset):
 *            scrollTop = sticky.docY - desiredStickyY
 *        - Clamped regime (desired sticky Y < sticky top offset):
 *            scrollTop = stickyParent.docBottom − desiredStickyY −
 *                        stickyHeight
 *      The target's offset within the sticky ancestor is invariant
 *      across scrollTop changes (it's a child of sticky), so placing
 *      sticky at the desired Y places the target back at the
 *      snapshot Y.
 *
 * Tuglaws conformance — read these before reaching for an alternative:
 *
 *  - **[L04]** No parent-triggered child setState pattern crossed by
 *    a measurement. The hook lives in the same component that owns
 *    the state being mutated; the synchronous `flushSync` boundary
 *    guarantees the DOM is at its post-mutation layout before the
 *    measurement runs. No "stale child DOM" timing hazard.
 *  - **[L05]** NO `requestAnimationFrame` anywhere. The compensation
 *    runs on the click event's call-stack, synchronously, before
 *    paint. rAF timing is not involved.
 *  - **[L06]** Appearance state flows through DOM, not React. The
 *    rect snapshot is a local const inside the click handler. The
 *    scroll compensation is a direct `scrollTop` write. There is NO
 *    React state inside this hook — no generation counter, no flag
 *    state, no useState anywhere. The pre-Phase-E.3-refactor version
 *    used a `useState` generation counter to trigger a
 *    `useLayoutEffect` between render and paint; that pattern routed
 *    appearance compensation through React's render cycle, violating
 *    L06 in spirit even though the counter was never rendered.
 *  - **[L07]** Live ref reads inside the click handler — no closures
 *    over stale state.
 *  - **[L23]** Preserves a stronger user-visible invariant ("click
 *    point stays under cursor") at the cost of a weaker one ("numeric
 *    scrollTop is preserved by the browser"). The user-visible thing
 *    is what the user sees and where they are pointing; numeric scroll
 *    offset is an implementation detail that serves that surface.
 *  - **[L24]** Local const for the snapshot. Direct DOM write for the
 *    adjustment. No structural state. Zone boundaries respected.
