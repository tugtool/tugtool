/**
 * selection-guard.ts -- SelectionGuard singleton (boundary enforcer + paint authority).
 *
 * Architecture: SelectionGuard operates at the CARD LEVEL only. It owns
 * two responsibilities:
 *
 *   1. **Boundary enforcement.** Clips selection at runtime when a
 *      drag or keyboard extension escapes a card's registered
 *      boundary (the `[data-card-host][data-card-id]` div registered
 *      by `CardHost` via `useSelectionBoundary`).
 *   2. **Multi-card paint authority.** Reads every card's published
 *      `Range` from `cardRanges`, the deck-store's focused card, and
 *      `windowHasFocus`, and paints each Range either natively (for
 *      the focused card when the window has focus) or into the
 *      `inactive-selection` CSS Custom Highlight (every other case).
 *      Runs on every `updateCardDomSelection` publish, every
 *      deck-store notify, and every app resign/become-active.
 *
 * It does NOT reach inside cards to manage content selection.
 * Components publish their selection via `updateCardDomSelection` and
 * own everything downstream of that.
 *
 * Only ONE CSS Custom Highlight: "inactive-selection" for every card
 * whose Range is not the currently-focused one. Native `::selection`
 * carries the focused card.
 *
 * Three-layer selection containment system:
 *   1. CSS `user-select: none` baseline (globals.css) prevents selection
 *      starting in chrome. Content components opt in with `user-select: text`.
 *   2. SelectionGuard (this file) clips selection at runtime when it escapes
 *      card boundaries:
 *        - Pointer-clamped clipping on every `pointermove` (primary path)
 *        - `selectionchange` safety net for keyboard-driven extension
 *        - RAF-based autoscroll for overflow cards
 *   3. `data-tug-select` attribute API: four modes (default, none, all,
 *      custom) give card authors fine-grained per-region control.
 *
 * See tuglaws/selection-model.md for the full system documentation.

/**
 * SelectionGuard — module-level singleton that enforces selection boundaries
 * at the card level and paints multi-card selection state.
 *
 * ## Architecture (boundary enforcer + paint authority)
 *
 * Active selection uses native `::selection`. One CSS Custom Highlight
 * (`inactive-selection`) renders dimmed selections for every card that
 * is not the currently-focused one, so the user sees a "remembered"
 * selection for every card even while only one card is active.
 *
 * Paint is driven by three inputs:
 *   - `cardRanges`: per-card Range, published by the card's owning
 *     component at deactivation transitions (e.g. `TugPromptInput`
 *     calls `engine.paintMirrorAsInactive(publish)` in its
 *     `onCardWillDeactivate` hook). Pre-Step-25C.5-Layer-3 the publish
 *     was a per-keystroke relay from `engine.onSelectionChanged`; that
 *     live mirror was dropped because the active card's range never
 *     painted from this map (native `::selection` carries it) and only
 *     deactivation hand-off needed the publish.
 *   - `windowHasFocus`: flipped by the app-lifecycle observer on
 *     `applicationDidResignActive` / `applicationDidBecomeActive`.
 *   - `getDeckStore().getSnapshot().activePaneId → pane.activeCardId`:
 *     the focused card.
 *
 * `updatePaint()` is the pure function of those inputs that mutates the
 * DOM highlight and native `window.getSelection()`. It fires on every
 * `cardRanges` update, every deck-store notify, and every resign/activate
 * transition. When focus genuinely moves to a card that has a saved
 * Range, a one-shot capture-phase `mousedown` interceptor is installed
 * before paint so the click that triggered the switch doesn't collapse
 * the about-to-be-restored selection to the click point.
 *
 * ## Registration
 *
 * Cards call `registerBoundary(cardId, element)` on mount and
 * `unregisterBoundary(cardId)` on unmount (via `useSelectionBoundary` hook).
 *
 * ## Lifecycle
 *
 * `attach()` installs document-level event listeners and subscribes to
 * the app lifecycle and the deck store. `detach()` releases all of them.
 * Called by `ResponderChainProvider`.
 *
 * ## Legacy selection persistence (retires at Step 16)
 *
 * `saveSelection(cardId)` / `restoreSelection(cardId, saved)` are the
 * pre-publish serialization API. Production callers were stripped at
 * Legacy API; the methods remain here for test
 * compatibility and retire at Step 16 per the plan's `@internal` /
 * removal pass.
 *
 * ## Testing
 *
 * `reset()` clears all state between test cases.

   *
   * - Every entry of `cardRanges` whose Range is still anchored to

   *   paints in the `inactive-selection` highlight, **except** when the
   *   entry's cardId is the focused card *and* the window has focus.
   *   In that case the Range paints natively via `window.getSelection()`
   *   instead.
   * - Stale Ranges (one or both endpoints detached from the document —
   *   see [R01](#r01-stale-ranges): an engine mutated its subtree
   *   without calling `updateCardDomSelection(cardId, newRange)`) are
   *   dropped from `cardRanges` and, in dev builds, logged with a
   *   `[selection-guard]` warning naming the offending `cardId`.
   * - When `windowHasFocus` is `false`, every live Range paints in the
   *   inactive highlight — including the focused card's. This matches
   *   the browser's own window-blur dim without needing a separate
   *   "deactivatedCardId" tracking field.
   *
   * ## Hint and short-circuit
   *
   * Callers may pass `{ changedCardId }` to indicate that only one
   * card's entry changed. When `changedCardId` matches the focused
   * card *and* the window has focus, the inactive-highlight set is by
   * construction unchanged (the focused card's Range doesn't paint
   * there), so the rebuild loop is skipped. Native `::selection`
   * already reflects the user's live selection in the focused engine —
   * no intervention needed. This bounds the cost of eager publishing
   * ([Q03]) to one `Map.set` + one short-circuit check per caret move.
   *
   * Deck-state-change callers pass no hint → full rebuild. Calls from
   * `handleApplicationDid{Resign,Become}Active` likewise pass no hint,
   * because the focus flip affects every entry's destination.
