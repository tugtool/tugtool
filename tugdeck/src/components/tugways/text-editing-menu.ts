/**
 * text-editing-menu — single source of truth for the standard
 * cut / copy / copy-as-plain-text / paste / paste-as-quote /
 * paste-as-plain-text /
 * select-all context menu.
 *
 * The items appear in the same order with the same labels and the
 * same shortcut hints across every text-bearing surface in the
 * suite — the prompt-entry editor, the transcript view, and any
 * future read-only or editable text surface that needs a context
 * menu. The disabled rules are the only thing that varies, and they
 * vary by capability:
 *
 *   - Cut requires a selection AND an editable surface.
 *   - Copy requires a selection.
 *   - Copy as Plain Text requires a selection.
 *   - Paste requires an editable surface.
 *   - Paste as Quote / Paste as Plain Text require an editable surface.
 *   - Select All is always enabled.
 *
 * Consumers pass the sampled selection and
 * receive an items array shaped like both `TugContextMenu`'s and
 * `TugEditorContextMenu`'s entry types. The two component types are
 * structurally identical for the fields used here, so consumers
 * pass the result through with a single TypeScript cast at the
 * call site.
 *
 * Why a shared builder rather than a shared item type:
 *   - The two menu components (`TugContextMenu`, `TugEditorContextMenu`)
 *     have slightly different generic and field expectations beyond
 *     the four-item universe, and unifying their entry types is a
 *     larger refactor than this layer needs.
 *   - Capabilities are the part that legitimately varies; the labels,
 *     shortcuts, order, and disabled-rule shape are universal. A
 *     builder gates the variable part and pins the universal part.
 *
 * No icons. The standard text-editing menu is text-only across the
 * suite; the four labels read cleanly as a list and adding icons
 * would crowd the menu without informational gain. Consumer-specific
 * additions (e.g. a custom action above the separator) can pick
 * their own iconography in a follow-up shape — the builder doesn't
 * police that, it just owns the universal set.

 * accepts a paste. **Selection comes from the caller**, sampled when the
 * menu opens, because it is the one fact the chain deliberately does not
 * carry: the menu-state mirror republishes on focus and registration
 * changes, not on caret moves, so a selection-granular answer from the
 * chain would be stale by the time a menu opened. A context menu is built
 * at the instant it opens and can read the live selection; the menu bar is
