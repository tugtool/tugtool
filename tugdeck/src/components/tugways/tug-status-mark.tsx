/**
 * `TugStatusMark` — the letter that says what happened to a file.
 *
 * Green **N** (new), yellow **M** (changed), red **D** (deleted) — a colored
 * single letter rather than a glyph, because at row size a letter reads and a
 * lucide file-icon does not ([D118]). Three letters cover every state any
 * surface here surfaces; the mapping from whatever vocabulary arrived at the
 * door lives in {@link statusMark} and nowhere else.
 *
 * **One element, every surface.** The Changes shade's file rows, the `/commit`
 * receipt, and a commit's hover roster all render this, so a mark cannot be
 * one width here and another tone there. Before this component the hover
 * painted its own `A`/`M`/`D`/`R` in its own four tones beside a file row
 * spelling the same commit `N`/`M`/`D` in three — the same file, two
 * alphabets, two inches apart.
 *
 * **Decorative by construction.** The letter is `aria-hidden`: it is a second
 * reading of a status the row already states in its provenance text and its
 * title, and a screen reader hearing "M" learns nothing it was not told.
 *
