/**
 * TugPath — a file path that truncates in the MIDDLE.
 *
 * A path's two informative ends are its root and its filename, and end
 * truncation destroys the more informative one: `/Users/kocienda/Mounts/u/src/
 * tugtool/tests/app-test/at0391-open-diff-neighbor-slot.te…` names a directory
 * chain the reader already knows and withholds the one word they were looking
 * for. This renders the path as two runs — a head that shrinks and ellipsizes
 * from its trailing edge, and a tail that stays — so the same path collapses as
 * `/Users/kocienda/Moun…/at0391-open-diff-neighbor-slot.test.ts`.
 *
 * Pure CSS, no measurement: two flex children, the head absorbing the shrink.
 * The tail shrinks only once the head has nothing left to give, so a filename
 * wider than its box still clips rather than overflowing.
 *
 * It carries **no type of its own** — no family, size, weight, or color. A path
 * is rendered by chrome at chrome's size and by a transcript block in the
 * block's mono face, and a primitive that decided that would be wrong at one of
 * them. The mechanism is what is shared; the voice belongs to the mount.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM, never React state, [L16] pairings
 *       declared (none — this component sets no color), [L19] component
 *       authoring guide, [L20] token sovereignty
 *

 * Where a path splits into the run that shrinks and the run that stays.

 * With no `tailLength`, the split is at the last separator, so the WHOLE
 * filename is pinned — the right rule for a surface whose reader is looking for
 * a name. A `tailLength` pins a fixed number of trailing characters instead,
 * which keeps the filename plus a little of its directory and gives a column of
 * paths a stable tail width.
