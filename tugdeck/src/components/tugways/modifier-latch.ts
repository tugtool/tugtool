/**
 * `modifier-latch` — the held-modifier bit, projected onto `<html>` as
 * `data-mods`.
 *
 * One consumer today: the **chord ring**. A default button whose activation is
 * `Shift+Return` rather than a plain `Return` wears the double ring dashed, and
 * the dash resolves to solid exactly while Shift is physically down ALONE — the
 * instant at which a `Return` really would fire it. So the ring never states
 * something false at any moment, and holding Shift becomes the gesture that
 * *shows you* what Return is about to do.
 *
 * "Alone" is why all four modifiers are latched rather than just the one that
 * is read. `Shift+Return` is an exclusive chord: `Cmd+Shift+Return` and
 * `Opt+Shift+Return` do NOT submit (`resolveEnterAction`'s caller disqualifies
 * every other modifier combination), so a ring that went solid on Shift held
 * with Cmd would be promising a keystroke that does nothing. The attribute
 * therefore carries the WHOLE held set and the ring matches it exactly
 * (`[data-mods="shift"]`), not as a member (`~="shift"`), which would match
 * every superset.
 *
 * Appearance, so it travels as a DOM attribute and never as React state
 * ([L06]) — the same shape as `data-app-active` (`deck-manager`) and `data-kbf`
 * (`focus-manager`).
 *
 * The latch reads `event.shiftKey` off EVERY key event rather than watching for
 * `key === "Shift"`. A modifier press and release are ordinary keydown/keyup
 * pairs that can be missed — a chord swallowed by a native menu, a keyup
 * delivered while another window is key — and a latch that only counts those
 * two events would then stay stuck down. Reading the flag off whatever key
 * event arrives next makes every keystroke a resync, so the worst case is one
 * stale frame rather than a permanently lit ring.
 *
 * Window `blur` clears it for the case no key event can correct: Shift held
 * while the user Cmd-Tabs away, whose keyup lands in the other app entirely.
 * (A background window paints no ring at all — `[data-app-active="false"]`
 * drops the outline on both paint paths — but the attribute would still be
 * wrong when the window came back, and a wrong attribute is a wrong test.)
