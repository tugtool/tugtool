/**
 * useSessionIdentityMenu — the right-click menu a session row offers, for the
 * whole row.
 *
 * A session row shows four facts and, until this hook, offered copies of them
 * through three unrelated claimants over two dead zones. The title span claimed
 * a single-item Copy that wrote the atom; the title's `TugLabel` claimed the
 * blank space beside it with the generic label menu, which copied the name; the
 * pulse stage claimed the activity line with a Copy of the beat. The
 * description line and the row's own background claimed nothing at all and fell
 * through to the app's "No Actions" fallback — and the description is the run a
 * reader is most likely to want out of the row, because it is the only one they
 * cannot read anywhere else.
 *
 * So: ONE menu, claimed by the row, listing every copy the row can offer.
 * Which pixel the press landed on no longer decides which menu opens, only
 * whether the two run-specific items at the bottom have anything to give.
 *
 *   Show Session / Resume Session   go to the session, however it must be reached
 *   ─────
 *   Copy as Atom                the citation + the atom sidecar — pastes as the chip
 *   Copy as Citation            the flat string, for outside Tug
 *   Copy Session ID             the full UUID, which nothing on screen shows
 *   ─────
 *   Copy Description            the whole synopsis, past the row's elision
 *   Copy Activity Line          the newest beat, when the session is running one
 *
 * **The first item is one item, not two.** A reader right-clicking a session
 * wants to GET to it; whether that costs a raise or a resume is the app's
 * problem, not theirs. So the item says which of the two it will be and does
 * it — `Show Session` when a card already holds the session, `Resume Session`
 * when none does. It is absent only where it could say nothing useful: on the
 * session's own card (the masthead), where the card to raise is the one the
 * pointer is in, and on a citation the ledger cannot resolve, which names no
 * session to go to. A session another process holds is shown DISABLED rather
 * than dropped — it is a real session, and it is unresumable for a reason a
 * reader can act on.
 *
 * The two lower items are DISABLED rather than absent when they have nothing:
 * a menu whose height changes with the session's state is a menu whose items
 * move under the pointer between one right-click and the next. A surface that
 * carries no such fact AT ALL — a citation chip has no activity feed behind it
 * — omits the item instead, which is a different thing: what is constant per
 * surface is the menu, and a permanently dead row is not information.
 *
 * `TugEditorContextMenu` rather than the Radix-backed `TugContextMenu`, for the
 * reason `useCopyableText` uses it: its items write to the clipboard inside the
 * mousedown, and it moves no focus — a row is chrome, and a copy from it must
 * not take the key view away from the card the reader is working in.
 *
 * Laws: [L11] controls emit actions, responders handle them — every item is a
 *       typed action dispatched to this hook's own responder;
 *       [L06] no appearance passes through React state.
