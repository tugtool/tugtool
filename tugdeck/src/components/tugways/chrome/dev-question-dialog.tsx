/**
 * `QuestionDialog` — inline chrome for an `AskUserQuestion` prompt.
 *
 * Renders a `control_request_forward` event with `is_question: true`
 * (Claude is asking the user to choose) as an *inline* block in the
 * transcript flow per [D13] — the sibling of `PermissionDialog`. Where
 * the permission variant asks allow/deny, this variant presents one or
 * more questions, each with a list of options, and round-trips the
 * chosen labels back to Claude as a `question_answer` frame.
 *
 * **One state.** Like `PermissionDialog` post-Step-3.5, a question
 * leaves no client-side recorded chrome — the durable record lives in
 * the conversation context via the matching tool_use / tool_result
 * pair (the `AskUserQuestionToolBlock` at the tool_use position IS
 * that recorded state). `handleRespondQuestion` clears
 * `pendingQuestion` and emits the outbound `question_answer` frame.
 * So this component has exactly one rendered state: the live dialog
 * while the request is the session's `pendingQuestion`. Once answered
 * (or skipped) it renders `null`.
 *
 * Layout (composed on `TugInlineDialog`'s header-bar primitive — see
 * [D01] / [D08]). Paged wizard. A single-question payload renders
 * inline (the question text goes in the dialog `description` and the
 * options fill the children slot). A multi-question payload renders
 * a vertical stack of *rows*, one per question, in three states:
 *
 *  - **done** — the user has picked at least one option. Row shows
 *    `✓ N. Question text · → chosen answer`. Clickable to jump back.
 *  - **current** — the row in focus. Shows `▸ N. Question text` and
 *    expands the options. Single-select picks auto-advance to the
 *    next row; multi-select waits for an explicit `Next`.
 *  - **pending** — not yet visited. Shows `○ N. Question text` only.
 *    Clickable to skip ahead.
 *
 * **Two control rows.** Dialog controls (`Cancel` / `Submit`) flow
 * into the primitive's trailing `actions` slot on the header row.
 * Wizard nav (`Back` / `Next`) shares a single row with the
 * progress summary (`{N} questions · {M} answered`) inside the body
 * slot, between the dialog description and the question accordion —
 * close enough to the questions for the touch target to feel coupled
 * to the row it mutates, but stable across question advances so the
 * button never moves out from under the mouse. Single-question
 * payloads omit the nav row (nothing to navigate, no progress to
 * summarize).
 *
 * The wizard exposes a **review state** at the end of the flow:
 * `currentIndex === questions.length` paints every row as its
 * post-interaction summary (no `current`), giving the user a final
 * pass over the answers before clicking `Submit`. `nextAdvanceIndex`
 * advances into review on the last question; the `Next` button
 * is disabled once in review.
 *
 * `Cancel` carries a confirmation popover (`TugConfirmPopover`,
 * imperative API). A stray click can't tear the AI's question down
 * without a second beat; the popover's confirm walks the family
 * `Cancel ≡ popInteractive` path. `Submit` is disabled until every
 * question carries a selection (matching the "no required answers
 * but submit gates on completeness" rule the user signed off on)
 * and is focused on mount so a Return key submits.
 *
 * **Auto-advance** on single-select is the headline GUI improvement
 * over the TUI's keyboard-only flow: picking an option commits the
 * selection and advances to the next row in one click. Multi-select
 * has no auto-advance — every pick is a deliberate toggle.
 *
 * **Answer shape.** `respondQuestion` sends `answers` keyed by the
 * question *text*; the value is the selected option `label` (single)
 * or the labels joined by a bare `,` with no spaces (multi). This
 * matches tugcode's `formatQuestionAnswer` (`tugcode/src/control.ts`).
 *
 * **Cancel ≡ Esc ≡ `popInteractive`** ([D02]). The Cancel button, the
 * Esc keypress (via the responder chain's `CANCEL_DIALOG` action), and
 * the prompt entry's Stop button all resolve to `session.popInteractive()`.
 * For a pending `AskUserQuestion` the queued-sends stack is empty, so
 * the pop falls through to `interrupt()` on the running turn; Claude
 * Code then emits the standard tool-rejected result ("The user doesn't
 * want to proceed…"). One gesture, one wire signal, one model reading
 * — no ambiguous empty-answers branch the assistant could misread as
 * "user chose defaults."
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L02] external state (is this request still pending?) enters
 *    React via `useSyncExternalStore` over the `CodeSessionStore`.
 *  - [L06] appearance flows through CSS + `TugDialogButton`'s
 *    `data-*` attributes; React state holds only the logical
 *    selection set ([L24]).
 *  - [L19] file pair (`.tsx` + `.css`), exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot` on the question-stack containers, this docstring.
 *  - [L20] component-token sovereignty — the dialog frame is
 *    delegated to `TugInlineDialog` (`--tugx-idialog-*`); each
 *    option row is a `TugDialogButton` (`--tugx-dialog-button-*`).
 *    This component owns only the small `--tugx-question-*`
 *    wizard-rail family.
 *  - [L23] in-progress answer state (selection set, visit set,
 *    wizard focus) is user data and must survive reload / cross-pane
 *    move / cold boot. The dialog opts into the [A9] Component State
 *    Preservation Protocol via {@link useSavedComponentState} +
 *    {@link useComponentStatePreservation}, keyed by
 *    `question-dialog/<request_id>` so the SAME request rehydrates
 *    its tuple but a NEW request mounts fresh. {@link seedQuestionDialogState}
 *    is the pure seed-merger consumed inside the `useState`
 *    initializers; the capture closure round-trips through it.
 *  - [L24] state zoning — the per-question selection set is component
 *    data in `useState`; the rendered radio/check mark is CSS-driven.
 *
 * Decisions:
 *  - [D13] inline (not modal) prompts; primary action focused on
 *    mount by this component (via `submitRef`) so Return submits.
 *    Three-layer survival contract: wire (tugcode in-flight snapshot)
 *    delivers the open request, reducer (`handleControlRequestForward`
 *    rehydrate branch) restores it to `pendingQuestion`, and this
 *    component's per-instance A9 opt-in restores the answers the user
 *    had filled in before the boundary fired.

  // sits on its own row inside the body slot, between the dialog
  // description and the question accordion — close enough to the
  // questions for the touch target to feel coupled to the row it
  // mutates, but stable across question advances so the button
  // never moves under the mouse.
  //
  // The dialog is card-modal ([P16]): inline display, trapped focus. Its
  // controls are decomposed into focus-language archetypes ([P17]) authored into
  // the trap — Cancel / Submit / Back / Next leaf buttons + the current
  // question's option group. The outer wrapper carries the `dev-question-dialog`
  // class (the scrim's bright-island marker, [P19]) and the cancel-action
  // responder root (`attachRoot`); it is NOT focusable, so clicking inert chrome
  // establishes no focus state ([P18]). `FocusModeScope` (from `useFocusTrap`)
  // wraps it so the controls join the pushed mode.
