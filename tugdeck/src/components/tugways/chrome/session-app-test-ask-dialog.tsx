/**
 * `AppTestAskDialog` — the inline dialog for a question raised from outside the
 * turn stream.
 *
 * A command-line tool that is about to do something the developer will feel
 * — an app-test run that seizes the screen is the case this was built for —
 * `POST`s to tugcast's `/api/ask` and blocks. That question lands on the
 * session's store as `pendingAsk`, and this renders it.
 *
 * ## Why it looks different from `PermissionDialog`
 *
 * Both compose `TugInlineDialog`, but they are not the same kind of thing and
 * must not be mistakable for one another. A permission prompt comes from the
 * assistant's own turn; this comes from any process that can reach loopback.
 * `/api/ask` is deliberately not dev-gated — a consent prompt that only works
 * on a dev build is no consent prompt — which means caller-supplied text is
 * reaching the user's Session card.
 *
 * So the caller gets `title`, `description`, and option labels, and nothing
 * else. The icon, the tone, and the provenance line above the title are the
 * app's, rendered as plain strings with no rich content from the wire. A
 * question cannot dress itself up as one of the app's own prompts. This raises
 * the cost of impersonation; it does not authenticate anyone — loopback is
 * still the actual trust boundary.
 *
 * ## Card-modal, like its siblings
 *
 * This is a card-modal inline dialog ([P16]): a trapped focus mode owns the
 * keyboard while it is up, Tab cycles only its own controls, Escape declines,
 * and the card content around it is scrimmed ([P19] — driven by the mount
 * site's `data-inline-dialog-pending`, which `inlineDialogPending` in
 * `session-card.tsx` sets off the snapshot's `pendingAsk`).
 *
 * While it is up the session reads **Awaiting** in the Z2 STATE cell and in the
 * Lens session row, the same as the permission and question dialogs. Those two
 * get there through the reducer's `phase`; this one cannot (it belongs to no
 * turn), so it reaches the indicator through `sessionSessionPhaseKey`'s own
 * `pendingAsk` axis — see `session-phase-visual.ts`.
 *
 * Modality is not decoration here. Without the trap the prompt entry keeps the
 * caret, and `TugTextEditor`'s Return defers to whatever default button the
 * responder chain holds in its pane — which would be this dialog's `Continue`.
 * A developer typing a prompt and pressing Return would answer a question they
 * were not looking at, with the preselected option, and lose the submit. The
 * trap plus the entry stand-down is what makes Return mean one thing at a time.
 *
 * The options are a `TugRadioGroup` in the body rather than `TugInlineDialog`'s
 * own `options` prop: that prop renders `TugDialogButton` rows, which carry no
 * focus registration and are reachable only by mouse. `PermissionDialog` makes
 * the same substitution for the same reason.
 *
 * ## Selection
 *
 * The safest option is preselected and seeded as the key view, so answering is
 * one keystroke and a reflexive Return never seizes the screen. Callers order
 * options with the declining one last; that is what Escape chooses, and what
 * the store falls back to when a question cannot be shown at all.
 *
 * ## The countdown
 *
 * A question that carries `unattendedChoice` is not asking permission — it is
 * offering a chance to intervene. Going ahead is the honest default there, and
 * a dialog that waited forever for a developer who has left the room would
 * strand the work it was being polite about. So the dialog counts
 * `countdownSecs` down in plain sight and commits when it reaches zero.
 *
 * Three things make that safe to leave running:
 *
 *  - **It commits the *selected* option, not the caller's.** The countdown
 *    decides *when*, never *what*. Moving the selection to "skip" and walking
 *    away skips — no control ever rests showing something other than what will
 *    happen.
 *  - **Touching the selection re-arms it.** A developer mid-decision gets the
 *    full duration back from their last keystroke rather than being timed out
 *    mid-thought.
 *  - **`unattendedChoice` is what it starts on**, so the preselection and the
 *    countdown say the same thing from the first frame.
 *
 * The tick writes into the DOM through a ref ([L06]) — a modal dialog has no
 * business re-rendering its whole subtree once a second — and the remaining
 * seconds live in a ref, never in state ([L24]).
 *
 * **Laws:** [L24] — `selectedOption` is a pre-commit draft owned by this
 * component and never leaves it; the question itself is local data on the
 * session store, read through `useSyncExternalStore` by the mount site ([L02]).
 * [L06] — tone and icon tint are CSS, not React state. [L11] — the radio group
 * is a control; its selection arrives through the responder chain.
