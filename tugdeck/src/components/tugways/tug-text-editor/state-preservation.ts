/**
 * tug-text-editor/state-preservation.ts — [L23] state preservation for the
 * `tug-text-editor` substrate.
 *
 * Three primitives plus a hook:
 *   - `restoreEditState(view, state)` — replace doc + atoms + selection
 *      in one transaction and write `scrollTop` directly. Companion to
 *      `applyEditState` (history nav, in `keymap.ts`); this function
 *      honors saved scroll position and intentionally does NOT focus
 *      so the active / inactive paint channels can decide that
 *      separately.
 *   - `paintMirrorAsActive(view, state?)` — claim focus, assert
 *      selection (when state is supplied), assert scrollTop. The only
 *      paint path that legitimately writes the global Selection. Used
 *      by exactly one editor per page at a time — the deck-level
 *      first responder.
 *   - `paintMirrorAsInactive(view, publish, state?)` — build a DOM
 *      Range from `view.state.selection` (or the supplied state's
 *      selection) over the live `cm-content` node and route it
 *      through the caller's `publish` callback (typically
 *      `selectionGuard.updateCardDomSelection(cardId, range)`).
 *      Selection paints via the `inactive-selection` CSS Custom
 *      Highlight; no focus claim, no `window.getSelection()`
 *      mutation.
 *   - `useTextEditorStatePreservation` — the React hook that registers
 *      save / restore / activate / deactivate callbacks with the
 *      enclosing `CardHost`, mirroring the
 *      `TugPromptInputStatePreservation` pattern.
 *
 * Why active-paint dispatches selection through `view.dispatch`
 * rather than writing `window.getSelection()` directly: CM6 owns the
 * `cm-content` node and reconciles browser Selection with
 * `view.state.selection` on every transaction; bypassing CM6 risks
 * the next reconcile pass overwriting whatever the direct write
 * placed. `view.dispatch({ selection })` is the supported way to set
 * caret + selection inside CM6, and `view.focus()` triggers CM6's
 * own selection-to-browser sync. ([R02])
 *
 * Why inactive-paint reads `view.contentDOM` at fire time: CM6's
 * content node identity may change across reconfigure (e.g., theme
 * switch). The Range we hand to `publish` anchors to nodes inside
 * whatever `view.contentDOM` resolves to NOW. selectionGuard's
 * full-rebuild branch already drops Ranges whose nodes are no longer
 * connected, so a subsequent reconfigure is recovered safely on the
 * next paint. ([R02])
 *
 * Laws: [L02] CM6 state (doc, atoms, selection) is the source of
 *        truth — never copied into React state, [L03] hook registers
 *        in `useLayoutEffect`, [L06] selection paint flows through
 *        the inactive-selection CSS Custom Highlight (declared
 *        globally in `tug-pane.css`), [L07] `viewRef.current` and
 *        `cardIdRef.current` are read at call time, [L10] the
 *        substrate doesn't know about deck/card IDs — the publish
 *        callback is the seam that hands selection routing to the
 *        deck layer, [L12] selection painted on inactive cards is
 *        confined to `selectionGuard.cardRanges[cardId]`, [L22] the
 *        save/restore stream is direct DOM observation through the
 *        CardHost protocol, [L23] active-paint runs after every
 *        inactive-paint via the CardHost ordering invariant; the
 *        consumer here only chooses the channel based on `isActive`,
 *        [L24] no React state for selection / scrollTop — both axes
 *        live in CM6 (`view.state.selection`, `view.scrollDOM.scrollTop`).

 * Each axis is honored independently: a number on `state.scrollTop`
 * writes vertical, a number on `state.scrollLeft` writes horizontal,

 * independence matters because legacy on-disk bags written before

 *
 * Comparison-then-write avoids a no-op DOM mutation that would

 * watching `view.scrollDOM`.
 *
 * Re-applied on every CM6 measure pass via `view.requestMeasure({

 * growing via `useContentDrivenPanelSize` after first paint,
 * `ResizeObserver`-driven viewport resizes, CM6's own measure cycle
 * recomputing the viewport, the browser's focus-driven
 * "scroll-to-caret" on first activation) do not overwrite the
 * persisted scroll position. The bag's `scrollTop` axis is
 * authoritative: any displacement after the initial restore-time
 * write is a side effect of layout settling, and the user-visible
 * contract is "first paint after activation = last saved scroll
 * offset" ([L23]).
 *
 * The CM6 measure cycle runs after every layout-affecting commit
 * (doc swap, ResizeObserver fire, scroll, focus). Queueing through
 * `requestMeasure` runs the write inside that cycle, AFTER any
 * other extension's measure work, so the bag value wins

 * Thin wrapper component that calls {@link useTextEditorStatePreservation}.
 *
 * Conditionally rendered by `TugTextEditor` based on its `preserveState`
 * prop so the hook (and its registration with the enclosing
 * `CardHost`) is opt-in. When omitted, no callbacks are registered
 * and the editor is invisible to CardHost's save / restore protocol
 * — useful for stand-alone harnesses (storybook, unit tests) that
 * mount `TugTextEditor` outside a deck.
 *
 * Returns `null` (no DOM); the hook is the work.
