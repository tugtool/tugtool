/**
 * tug-text-editor/atom-type-over.ts — type-over-selected-atom input.
 *
 * An atom chip is a CM6 replaced widget over a U+FFFC placeholder, and
 * CM stamps the widget's DOM node `contentEditable="false"`. When the
 * selection covers only (or partly) such a node, WebKit will not let a
 * typed character replace it — the keystroke is dropped or inserted
 * adjacent, so the chip survives. That breaks the universal editing
 * contract that typing over a selection replaces it.
 *
 * This handler restores it: on a printable keystroke whose selection
 * spans an atom, it dispatches the replacement itself (the selected
 * range → the typed character) and preventDefault's the browser's
 * broken default. Plain-text selections are left to the native DOM path,
 * which already replaces correctly; IME composition and modified chords
 * (Cmd/Ctrl) are yielded untouched.
 *
 * Selection membership is read straight from the document: every atom
 * carries a backing U+FFFC, so a selection whose sliced text contains
 * {@link TUG_ATOM_CHAR} covers at least one atom.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance/DOM handled outside React state, [L11] the edit
 *        rides the transaction stream, [L19] file structure.

 * no DOM, so the replace behavior is exercisable headlessly.
 *
 * Replacing the selected range with the character does not, on its own,
 * clear the covered atoms' decorations: an atom at the range start maps
 * onto the inserted character under the field's auto-mapping (a replace
 * decoration stretches over an insertion rather than collapsing), so the
 * typed character would render AS the chip. The covered atoms are dropped
 * explicitly via {@link removeAtomsEffect} — the same mechanism command
