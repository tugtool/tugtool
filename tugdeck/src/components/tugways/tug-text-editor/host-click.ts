/**
 * tug-text-editor/host-click.ts — the host is the text surface: a click
 * anywhere inside the `.tug-text-editor` wrapper lands the caret.
 *
 * CM6 owns pointer selection only within `view.contentDOM`, which is
 * content-sized. A host taller than its content (the Dev card's prompt
 * opens at `--tug-text-editor-min-height`) leaves a blank band below the
 * last line — inside the scroller, outside the content. A mousedown there
 * reaches no CM6 handler, and WebKit's mousedown focus default then walks
 * up from the non-focusable scroller and clears focus to body: the caret
 * vanishes because the user clicked *inside their own editor*.
 *
 * This extension closes the dead band. A primary-button mousedown inside
 * the host but outside `contentDOM` claims the gesture: suppress the
 * focus-clearing default, focus the editor, and land the caret at the
 * document position nearest the click (`posAtCoords(…, false)` — below
 * the last line that is the end of the nearest column on the last row).
 * Clicks that belong to other in-host surfaces pass through untouched:
 *
 *  - inside `contentDOM` — CM6's own pointer selection;
 *  - inside `.cm-gutters` — CM6's gutter semantics (line select);
 *  - on the scrollbar band (outside the scroller's client box) — native
 *    scrollbar dragging;
 *  - non-primary buttons — context menus must not move the caret;
 *  - a read-only editor (the Dev prompt stood down behind a card-modal
 *    dialog) — a deactivated surface claims nothing.
 *
 * Laws: [L03] listeners installed by the ViewPlugin lifecycle; [L06] no
 *        React state — the gesture goes straight to a CM6 transaction;
 *        [L19] file pair with `__tests__/host-click.test.ts`.
