/**
 * tug-text-editor/selection-layer.ts — custom CodeMirror 6 layer that paints
 * `.cm-selectionBackground` divs behind every non-empty selection
 * range.
 *
 * This file deliberately does NOT use `drawSelection` from
 * `@codemirror/view`. `drawSelection` is a bundle of three concerns
 * (selection overlay, styled cursor, native-caret/native-selection
 * suppression at `Prec.highest` with `!important`) and only the first
 * is desirable here. The native caret is what we use for the visible
 * cursor — sized by line-box, uniform across text and atom positions
 * thanks to the `.cm-line::before` ghost element in `theme.ts`. Native
 * `::selection` is suppressed by a single rule in `theme.ts` so it
 * doesn't double-paint with this overlay.
 *
 * The overlay is a real DOM layer rendered behind the editable
 * surface. It survives editor blur (the layer keeps its DOM up
 * between updates) and covers atom widgets cleanly because it's
 * geometric — `RectangleMarker.forRange` walks the selected range
 * and emits one or more rect markers regardless of what content
 * the range covers.
 *
 * Gutter clip: `RectangleMarker.forRange` extends every fully-covered
 * visual row to the content's right edge — the BBEdit/native convention
 * for "the line break is part of the selection" — which is exactly what
 * we want. What we don't want is the left-gutter sliver it also emits:
 * because the themes use a hanging indent, `leftSide` sits left of the
 * first glyph, so a row whose selection ends at column 0 paints a small
 * orphan box in that gutter. `clipMarkerToText` slices each emitted rect
 * into one strip per visual row, clamps each strip's LEFT edge in to that
 * row's first glyph, and drops strips that collapse to nothing — leaving
 * the full-width right edge intact. Geometry is still all CM6's; we only
 * pull the left in and drop empties.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] selection range data is owned by CM6's `EditorState`,
 *        not React state, [L06] overlay is appearance painted via
 *        DOM layer, [L19] file structure, [L22] direct DOM-update
 *        observer (CM6 layer's `markers()` is called on each update
 *        without any React round-trip).

 * on the final row). A strip that collapses to nothing — a row whose
 * selection is only the trailing newline sitting in the hanging-indent
 * gutter — is dropped rather than painting an orphan sliver.
 *
 * In wrap mode the right edge is also clamped to the viewport: a selection
 * over a hung trailing space (white-space: pre-wrap) must not paint past
 * the line edge, both visually and — since the strip is a scroller child —
 * to keep it from inflating `scrollWidth` and re-enabling horizontal
 * scroll. See the inline note at `markerRight`.
