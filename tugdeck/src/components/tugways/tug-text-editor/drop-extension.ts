/**
 * tug-text-editor/drop-extension.ts — file-drop atom insertion + live drop
 * caret indicator.
 *
 * Wires three concerns into one extension:
 *
 *   1. **Drop caret indicator.** A live thin-vertical-line caret
 *      tracks the resolved drop position in real time as the user
 *      drags a file over the editor. Without this the user has no
 *      idea where their drop will land — a critical UX gap. The
 *      caret position carries a vertical bias (`DROP_Y_OFFSET_RATIO`):
 *      the hit-test point is shifted upward so the resolved position
 *      sits above the drag ghost rather than behind it.
 *
 *   2. **`dragover` accept.** `preventDefault()` on `dragover` is
 *      required to indicate the editor accepts drops; without it
 *      the OS refuses the drag and no `drop` event ever fires.
 *      We further set `dataTransfer.dropEffect = "copy"` so the
 *      cursor shows the copy-cursor variant. The editor accepts
 *      every file drag — there is no cursor-level rejection — so
 *      we don't need to look at per-file MIME information at this
 *      stage.
 *
 *   3. **`drop` insertion.** `preventDefault()` to suppress the
 *      WebView's default navigate-to-file-URL behavior, then a
 *      single transaction inserts each dropped file into the
 *      editor. Files with image extensions (png / jpg / jpeg /
 *      gif / svg / webp) become atoms (image chips routed through
 *      the downsample pipeline when a bytes-store is available);
 *      every other file inserts its basename as plain text. Mixed
 *      drops interleave the two with single-space separators, all
 *      in one CM6 transaction.
 *
 * The caret is implemented with CM6's standard StateField +
 * ViewPlugin + `requestMeasure` pattern — same shape as CM6's
 * built-in `dropCursor` extension. We don't compose `dropCursor`
 * directly because its `dragover` observer doesn't apply the Y
 * bias and runs as `eventObservers` (which cannot
 * `preventDefault`); we need the bias and we need to claim the
 * dragover event so the `drop` event ever fires.
 *
 * The whole drop is one CM6 transaction: a single `changes` insert
 * of `N × U+FFFC` followed by `addAtomsEffect.of([…])` carrying
 * every atom's segment + position. CM6 only ever observes the
 * post-drop state — there's no intermediate frame where the
 * placeholder characters render without their widgets.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via DOM (the drop caret is an
 *        absolutely-positioned `<div>` in `view.scrollDOM`, not
 *        React state; atom widgets render as images), [L07] the
 *        dropHandler thunk reads the latest host-supplied handler
 *        at fire time, [L13] no rAF — the caret position is
 *        committed via `view.requestMeasure` (CM6's measure-phase
 *        scheduler), the drop is one transaction dispatched
 *        directly from the DOM event handler, [L19] file structure
 *        (`tug-text-editor/drop-extension.ts` paired with
 *        `tug-text-editor-drop.test.ts`).
 *
 * Third-party notice: CodeMirror 6 (MIT) — see
 * `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. The drop caret pattern (StateField
 * tracking a position + ViewPlugin painting it via
 * `requestMeasure`) is adapted from CM6's `dropCursor`
 * implementation.

/**
 * Convert user-dropped or user-pasted files into atoms + filename text
 * in a SINGLE document mutation.
 *
 * Preflight first, mutate once: every file is resolved to its final
 * form — a valid image (bytes decoded and ready), a non-image filename,
 * or a rejected image degraded to filename text — BEFORE anything is
 * inserted. Only then do we mint `image-N` labels, stage the bytes, and
 * dispatch one `insertMixedAt` transaction. There is no optimistic
 * skeleton and no async repair pass, so:
 *  - the insertion is a single history entry — one undo removes the
 *    whole drop cleanly, with no skeleton or tofu resurrected (the
 *    repair-transaction undo hazard is gone by construction), and
 *  - a rejected image never flashes a pending chip; it simply lands as
 *    its filename, with the reason surfaced via `onError`.
 *
 * The image atoms carry the unified `image-N` name (numbered after the
 * image atoms already in the doc), not the original filename: the name
 * can't cross the wire (the image content block carries none), so the
 * editor speaks the same `image-N` the transcript synthesizer mints.
 * Only surviving images consume an ordinal; a rejected image degrades
 * to text and takes none.
 *
 * Bytes are put into the store BEFORE insertion so each atom renders
 * fully on first paint. `view.dom.isConnected` is re-checked after the
 * decode await — if the editor unmounted while we were decoding, the
 * insertion is skipped (the doc is gone anyway).
 *
 * Returns a `Promise` (the decode is awaited); callers fire-and-forget
 * with `void`. Exported so the paste handler in `clipboard-filters.ts`
 * shares the same pipeline.

/**
 * Build the drop-handling extension.
 *
 * `host` is the `tug-text-editor` wrapper `<div>` rendered by `TugTextEditor`.
 * The drop pipeline writes the `data-drop-active` attribute on
 * this element so the CSS rules in `tug-text-editor.css` can paint the
 * drop ring, hide the regular caret, and switch the selection
 * overlay to the inactive variant — all while a drag is in
 * progress, restored to the pre-drag appearance the moment the
 * drag ends (drop / dragleave-out / dragend).
 *
 * `getDropHandler` is a thunk so the React shell can mirror its
 * `dropHandler` prop into a ref and pass a closure that reads the
 * ref at fire time — same [L07] pattern the keymap and completion
 * extensions use. Returns `null` to opt into the default
 * extension-based file→atom conversion.
 *
 * `getBytesStore` and `onAttachmentError` are the bytes-store-aware
 * additions (Step 2 of `roadmap/dev-atoms.md`). When `getBytesStore`
 * returns a live `AtomBytesStore`, the drop pipeline runs through
 * the `processAttachmentFiles` path: each image is preflighted
 * (downsampled) before insertion — valid images are given a stable
 * UUID and stashed in the store, rejected images degrade to filename
 * text — then the final atoms + text land in one transaction.
 * Non-image files insert their basename as plain text. When
 * `getBytesStore` returns `null` (gallery cards, prompt-entry
 * instances unrelated to a dev session), the synchronous
 * `defaultFilesToMixedItems` path runs — image atoms come back with
 * `value: filename` and no bytes; non-image entries ride as filename
 * text.
 *
 * `onAttachmentError(message)` hands a downsample-rejection message
 * to the host, which surfaces it as a calm card-scoped notice (the
 * Dev card raises a pane bulletin); tests can pass a spy.
 *
 * A host-supplied `getDropHandler()` still wins over the default —
 * the gallery card uses that escape hatch to inject deterministic
 * test atoms. When both `getBytesStore()` and `getDropHandler()` are
 * non-null, the custom handler takes precedence and no async
 * processing happens.
 *
 * The DOM event handlers attach to the HOST wrapper (native
 * listeners installed by a ViewPlugin), NOT to `view.contentDOM`
 * via `EditorView.domEventHandlers`. The content DOM is
 * content-sized: a host taller than its content (the Dev prompt's
 * min-height) has a blank band below the last line where a drag
 * targets the scroller and never reaches a contentDOM handler — the
 * OS would refuse the drop over the editor's own empty space. The
 * host is the text surface (same rule as `host-click.ts`), so the
 * drag surface is the host: events over content bubble up to it,
 * and events over the blank band land on it directly.
 *
 * Returns an array of extensions (StateField + ViewPlugin + theme +
 * event handlers) so the consumer doesn't have to know the
 * internal pieces.
