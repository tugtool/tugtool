/**
 * annotation-links — the content annotator's file references, followable
 * from inside a source buffer.
 *
 * The annotator proper is a DOM pass: it walks rendered markdown, asks a
 * resolver whether each path candidate names a real file, and marks the
 * ones that do. That reaches every surface built out of rendered ink and no
 * surface built out of an editor — so a path copied out of the transcript
 * and into a jot arrives with its text intact and its link gone, because
 * the jot is a CodeMirror document and there is no rendered `<code>` span
 * for a pass to mark.
 *
 * This extension closes that gap without rendering anything. It runs the
 * same grammar (`scanPathReferences`) over the visible lines of the buffer,
 * asks the same resolver, and builds the same payload
 * (`payloadForReference`) — so a reference is followable here if and only
 * if it would have been clickable in the transcript, and the gesture it
 * fires is the registry's own `primaryClick`, the one the transcript's
 * delegated listener fires. One grammar, one gate, one action; only the
 * carrier differs.
 *
 * **Why the accelerator.** The buffer is being edited, so a plain click has
 * to keep placing the caret. ⌘-click (Ctrl off macOS) follows, and a
 * confirmed reference underlines while the modifier is held — the text
 * card's `anchor-links` gesture exactly, because a user who learns it in
 * one editor should not have to learn it again in another.
 *
 * **Resolution is asynchronous, decoration is not.** `resolvePath` answers
 * from cache and records what it could not answer; the verdict arrives
 * later. So the plugin subscribes to verdict batches and rebuilds on each
 * one, which is the editor's version of the DOM pass's re-mark. Until an
 * answer lands the run is plain text — the annotator's rule that every
 * refusal, and every not-yet, is silent.
 *
 * Appearance-only via a CM6 mark decoration + CSS ([L06]).
