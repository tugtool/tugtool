/**
 * tug-text-editor/clipboard-filters.ts — copy / cut / paste DOM event
 * handlers for atom-bearing tug-text-editor selections.
 *
 * ## Wire format
 *
 * This module owns the *browser-mode* clipboard path (a normal Safari /
 * Chrome tab during development). Inside Tug.app (WKWebView) copy and
 * paste of atom selections go through the native NSPasteboard bridge
 * instead (see `tug-native-clipboard.ts` and `tug-text-editor.tsx`),
 * because WebKit's pasteboard normalization swallows custom MIME types
 * and sanitizes HTML — both of which silently drop atom data. The
 * native bridge writes/reads a Tug-private pasteboard type
 * (`dev.tug.prompt-atoms`) carrying the same sidecar this module emits,
 * so the wire schema below is shared across both paths.
 *
 * In browser mode, two payloads land on the system clipboard for every
 * copy / cut:
 *
 * 1. `text/plain`: human-readable text where each U+FFFC has been
 *    substituted with the atom's label. External apps that paste
 *    plain text see meaningful characters, not tofu glyphs.
 * 2. `application/x-tug-atoms`: the raw JSON sidecar
 *    (`{version, text, atoms}`). Within one browser, the synchronous
 *    `copy`/`paste` event preserves this custom type in-process, so the
 *    paste handler reads it straight back — no HTML envelope needed.
 *
 * ## Self-contained sidecar (atoms carry their bytes)
 *
 * The sidecar is fully self-contained so a selection round-trips across
 * cards / windows / sessions, not just within the card that still holds
 * the bytes. Each atom entry carries its `segment` (including the
 * optional `id`) and, for image atoms whose bytes live in the per-card
 * `AtomBytesStore`, the `bytes` themselves. On paste the handler
 * rehydrates those bytes into the destination card's store keyed by the
 * atom id, so the chip reconstitutes fully — image preview, submit-time
 * wire payload, and all.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] DOM clipboard manipulation, no React state, [L07]
 *        event handlers receive the live `view` from CM6's dispatch,
 *        [L11] clipboard operations are responder actions on the
 *        component-owned document, [L19] file structure, [L22]
 *        direct DOM event handling without React round-trip.
