/**
 * tug-text-editor/atom-integrity.ts — position-sensitive atom rules.
 *
 * A command atom is a command only while it leads the document: claude
 * expands `/name` into a user invocation only when the message text
 * begins with it (see `lib/command-atom.ts`). A command chip that an
 * edit pushes off position 0 — the user typed or pasted text in front
 * of it — would otherwise ride along as a U+FFFC placeholder that
 * never expands, never errors, and silently ships as a broken message.
 *
 * The rule enforced here: any doc change that leaves a command atom at
 * a position other than 0 *demotes* it in the same transaction — the
 * U+FFFC is replaced with the command's literal `/name` text, and the
 * replace-decoration collapses out of the field via its auto-mapping.
 * The demotion rides the user's own edit as one atomic transaction, so
 * undo restores both the edit and the chip together
 * (`atomInvertedEffects` records the collapsed atom for the undo).
 *
 * Implemented as an `EditorState.transactionFilter` — the only hook
 * that may append *changes* (not just effects) to an in-flight
 * transaction. Undo/redo transactions are exempt: history must restore
 * recorded states verbatim, and every demotion it can replay was
 * already recorded as part of the edit that caused it.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] atom state lives in the CM6 field, [L11] the demotion is
 *        a document edit dispatched through the transaction stream,
 *        [L19] file structure, [L22] no React round-trip.

 *
 * Atoms *added by this transaction's own effects* are invisible here
 * (the filter sees only the start-state set) — deliberately: accepting
 * a completion is never demoted by its own insertion, and a state
 * restore that replays atoms via effects is left untouched until the
 * next real edit.
