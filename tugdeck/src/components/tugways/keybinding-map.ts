/**
 * keybinding-map.ts — the shape a scoped keybinding takes.
 *
 * This file used to hold the app's global chord map. It does not any more:
 * the shipped chords are default `bindings` on their command's registry
 * entry, and stage 1 resolves the global layer through `keymap-registry.ts`.
 * A chord and a menu item are two doors on one row, which they cannot be
 * while a second table also claims to say what a chord means.
 *
 * What remains is the *shape*, because scoped bindings still use it.
 * `useKeybindings` registrants declare chords that are live only inside a
 * responder or a focus mode, and some of them name verbs that are
 * deliberately outside the command table — the PDF card's scroll keys, the
 * gallery's demo chord. Those dispatch an action directly, so they carry an
 * action rather than a command id.
 *
 * The match rule lives in `chord-format.ts` with the rest of the chord
 * alphabet, so the scoped layer and the global layer agree on what "this
 * chord" means by construction rather than by inspection.
