/**
 * TugPaneBanner — Card-scoped modal banner for card-level error / attention states.
 *
 * Combines TugBanner's visual language (strip at top + detail panel) with
 * TugSheet's scoping mechanics (portal into the card, `inert` on .tug-pane-body,
 * positioned below the title bar). Unlike TugBanner, TugPaneBanner does not
 * block the app — only the card it's mounted in. Other cards on the deck remain
 * fully interactive.
 *
 * Two variants:
 * - "error": strip (label + message) + centered detail panel (children) with
 *   pinned footer. The card body gets a dim backdrop so the detail panel reads
 *   as a modal overlay. `role="alert"` / `aria-live="assertive"`.
 * - "status": strip only, no detail panel, no backdrop. `role="status"` /
 *   `aria-live="polite"`.
 *
 * Both variants slide the strip down from the title-bar edge on enter and
 * reverse on exit; the error variant additionally fades the detail panel.
 * `inert` is applied to `.tug-pane-body` while the banner is mounted and
 * released only after the exit animation's `.finished` so interaction
 * returns in sync with the visuals.
 *
 * Lifecycle is self-managed (consumer drives `visible`). Animation uses
 * TugAnimator per L13; CSS keyframes are the wrong regime here because the
 * library doesn't own mount/unmount (L14).
 *
 * The banner itself is not a responder. Footer buttons are controls owned by
 * the consumer — dismiss is the consumer's responsibility per L11 (no
 * onDismiss callback prop). Pass a <TugPushButton> or equivalent in `footer`
 * whose onClick routes through the chain or updates local state.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM,
 *       [L11] controls emit actions; responders handle them,
 *       [L13] TugAnimator for self-managed programmatic motion,
 *       [L14] no CSS keyframes for self-managed lifecycle,
 *       [L16] pairings declared,
 *       [L19] component authoring guide,
 *       [L20] token sovereignty (composes consumer-supplied footer controls)
