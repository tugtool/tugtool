/**
 * SessionMasthead — the three lines a Session card wears in pane chrome.
 *
 *   [dot] <name> : <callsign>     ← identity, and whether it is working
 *   <description>                 ← the agent's synopsis, or a stand-in
 *   <activity>               ~~~  ← the voice, with its activity sparkline
 *
 * Three levels of the same session, widening as they go down: what it IS, what
 * it is FOR, and what it is doing this second.
 *
 * **The three lines are `SessionIdentityRow`'s, not this component's.** The
 * masthead, the Lens rows, and the new-session picker rows show the same thing,
 * so they wear one authoring of it — not only of the shape but of what goes in
 * it: the identity, the description ladder, the activity ladder, the phase dot,
 * and the tape are all that component's, and this one asks for them at the
 * masthead's settings (the dense dot, sub-lines flush with the title, the tape
 * on, the beat paced and set through the markdown pipeline) ([D132]).
 *
 * What stays local is what is genuinely the masthead's: the two popovers, the
 * telemetry widget, the copy gestures, and the chrome geometry — the row is
 * mounted with its list-row padding zeroed and each of its three lines told
 * what to stop short of, because the pane's control cluster occupies only the
 * FIRST of the tier's three bands.
 *
 * The pane owns the chrome SLOT and its geometry; this component owns what is
 * inside it and every store behind those lines. That split is what keeps
 * session-domain machinery — the PULSE feed, the activity series, the
 * `pulse/enabled` default, the telemetry the popover reports — out of pane
 * code while chrome stays the pane's ([L09]). The precedent is the Session
 * card mounting `TugPaneBanner`: pane-class furniture, session-class content
 * inside it.
 *
 * The pane's whole controls cluster renders over this tier — the slot-stack
 * badge, the `…` section menu, the width control, and the close X — and the
 * summary widget below stands on that same row rather than replacing any of
 * them. The width control was suppressed here for a while on the argument that
 * the title row was already identity plus a widget; the Session card is the
 * pane whose width is retuned most often, so that left the control missing from
 * the one surface that most wanted it.
 *
 * Keyed by `sessionId`, which is all the pane knows and all it should: the
 * chrome names a session and this component resolves what to say about it.
 * Identity comes through `useSessionIdentity`, so a rename or a callsign
 * reroll repaints the masthead with no reload and no pane involvement.
 *
 * The masthead never reflows. Every line truncates rather than wrapping, the
 * description line holds its place when empty, and the slot's height is a
 * fixed token — a chrome tier that changed height with its content would move
 * the card beneath it on every pulse.
 *
 * The trailing widget opens the telemetry popover: branch, state, turns,
 * stamps, and the citation with a copy affordance. A popover is where the copy
 * lives rather than a hover surface, because a hover-dismissed panel puts its
 * own button out of the pointer's reach — and rather than a `TugPlacard`,
 * which renders in place and needs its caller to own the vertical axis inside
 * a positioned ancestor, a contract a clipping 72px chrome tier cannot honour.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] every store enters through `useSyncExternalStore`;
 *       [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM, never React state;
 *       [L09] chrome is the pane's — the pane mounts this into a slot it owns;
 *       [L19] `.tsx`/`.css` pair with `data-slot`;
 *       [L20] `TugPulse` is composed through its published knobs only.

        placeholder rather than a permanent label — so the affordance moves to
        the reading itself: click what you are reading to see more of it.

        dismissOnChainActivity=false: a row's right-click → Copy dispatches the
        `copy` action through the responder chain, which would otherwise read as
        foreign chain activity and close this popover mid-copy. The copy
        originates from WITHIN the popover, so it must not dismiss it; Escape,
        click-outside, and a second click on the line still close it.

        A POPOVER, not a placard. `TugPlacard` renders in place and asks its
        caller to own the vertical axis inside a positioned ancestor — a
        contract a 72px chrome tier with `overflow: hidden` cannot honour, so
        the panel opened clipped by the bar it was mounted in and painted over
        the lines beside it. The popover portals to the deck's canvas overlay
        and positions itself against this button, which is what every other
        chrome affordance in the masthead already does.
