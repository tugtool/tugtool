/**
 * `TugHistoryList` — a read-only list of commits with inline detail ([P10]).
 * One compact mono `TugListRow` per commit — the same row density as
 * {@link TugChangesList}'s file rows: the shared {@link CommitIdentityLine}
 * (`<sha> : <subject>`) leads; a reader-chosen metadata cell, a Copy control,
 * and a fold cue sit on the trailing edge, over a detail body that expands and
 * collapses in place.
 *
 * Type, leading, and layout come from the `.tugx-commit` scale
 * (`commit-presentation.css`), the same scale the `/commit` durable receipt
 * wears — one commit reads identically in the shade and in the transcript.
 *
 * The trailing metadata is a choice, not a default: `metaFields` says which of
 * author / date / time each row carries, so a reader who wants the committer
 * and one who wants the clock both get the list they asked for.
 *
 * Expanding reveals the full commit message, the commit's changed files as a
 * {@link CommitChangesList} (its own single-shot `GIT_COMMIT_FILES` request,
 * hunks lazy per row), and the committer's full identity + complete date,
 * right-aligned at the bottom. Copy writes the whole record — the complete
 * 40-char hash, attribution, and message — whatever the fold state.
 *
 * Presentation carries no lifecycle dot — a landed commit has no lifecycle.
 * Per-commit collapse is UNCONTROLLED (local `useState`, like a receipt row);
 * the detail body mounts on expand and unmounts on collapse ([L26]), so each
 * expanded row's commit-files store lives exactly as long as its body.
 *
 * ## Filtering
 *
 * The host trims the list ({@link commitFilterFields} says what a commit is
 * matched on) and passes the query down as `filterQuery` so each row can show
 * WHY it survived: the matched spans of the sha, the subject, and the join
 * badge wear the shared filter mark, and a row kept by a term that only
 * appears in its file
 * roster names the paths that matched — otherwise a commit whose subject says
 * nothing about the query reads as a mismatch the filter failed to remove.
 *
 * `filterScope` aims that match at some of the commit's surfaces rather than
 * all of them ({@link CommitFilterScope}), and the marks obey it: a mark is a
 * claim that this text is why the row is here, so text the filter was told not
 * to read is left unmarked even when the query happens to appear in it.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the commit-files store enters React through
 * `useSyncExternalStore`; [L06] tones and hover affordances paint via CSS,
 * never React state; [L26] the detail body collapses by unmount.
