/**
 * TugSlot — one numbered position in a layout, drawn as a small card.
 *
 * A slot stands for a place a card can be put, so it is shaped like the thing
 * it places: a little taller than it is wide, with nearly-squared corners and
 * its number centered. It is never ghosted — a slot with no card in it is still
 * a card-shaped rectangle, because an invisible slot stops evoking a pane.
 *
 * Three resting looks, on the `state` axis:
 *
 *  - `"rest"` — the position is empty. A quiet tinted card.
 *  - `"outlined"` — a card is here, but it is not the one on top.
 *  - `"filled"` — a card is here and it is the one on top.
 *
 * Hover, pressed, and disabled are the interaction layer over whichever
 * resting look is in force. They come from `TugButton`'s emphasis × role
 * tokens, so a slot's states move with the theme exactly as every other
 * control does ([L20] — this file adds no color of its own, only shape and
 * numerals).
 *
 * A slot is interactive only when it is given something to do. Pass `onSelect`
 * and it renders as a focus-refusing `TugButton`; omit it and the slot renders
 * as an inert `<span>` — the exemplar form, for showing an arrangement rather
 * than operating one.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS and DOM attributes, never React state;
 *       [L11] the interactive form is a control that emits through its
 *       `onSelect`; [L15] token-driven states; [L16] pairings declared;
 *       [L19] component authoring guide; [L20] token sovereignty — the
 *       composed `TugButton` keeps its own tokens.
 * Decisions: [D02] emphasis × role system; [D121] layout imposition.
