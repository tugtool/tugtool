/**
 * TugSparkline — a stock-ticker activity graph.
 *
 * Two rules, like ticker tape:
 *  1. Values are NEVER revised. A point, once shown, is permanent; the pen
 *     holds the newest value flat to the right edge (the geometry's held
 *     tail), so the line is always full edge to edge without ever stopping
 *     short — a quiet stretch is the held value, not a gap.
 *  2. New samples write at the right edge and scroll left at a constant rate.
 *
 * THE DATA EVENT IS THE ONLY CLOCK. The tape never polls: the caller's
 * `subscribeActivity` channel fires synchronously when data records, and
 * every point the tape appends is downstream of one of those events. The
 * only timers are finishers for work an event started, and each terminates
 * by construction: a settle burst that keeps sampling at {@link SAMPLE_MS}
 * until the plotted value stops moving (a rate's rolling window draining to
 * baseline after the last datum — it empties in ~1s; a held gauge settles
 * on the first tick), and one flat-off timeout that retires the scroll once
 * the last change has scrolled fully off screen. An idle tape holds zero
 * timers and zero animations because nothing is running, not because
 * something detected quiet.
 *
 * The scroll is a single continuous WAAPI `translateX` composited on the
 * GPU (Smoothie Charts' time→x mapping, adapted off its rAF loop — see
 * THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md, MIT). There is no per-frame redraw loop: between
 * appends the compositor does the motion. The animation is created ONCE per
 * mount and never recreated; each epoch the scroll time-rebases by writing
 * `startTime`, so coordinates stay bounded without any teardown.
 *
 * ONE CLOCK. The tape's own axis and the scroll's position are the same
 * function of `performance.now()`. The animation's origin is written from the
 * very clock reading the tape starts with, which is what makes the time→x map
 * in `lib/sparkline-geometry.ts` and the transform agree exactly rather than by
 * accident — a pending start time, resolved at some later rendering update,
 * used to leave a per-instance horizontal offset for a whole epoch. Wall clock
 * survives at exactly one named seam inside `SparklineTape`, because the
 * activity meters bin on absolute wall-clock indices and that is what decays a
 * stalled stream to baseline.
 *
 * THE SCROLL NEVER MOVES AHEAD OF ITS PIXELS. An origin change is painted
 * first and applied only when the surface acknowledges those pixels exist —
 * one path, no fast path, with a watchdog so a lost acknowledgement cannot
 * freeze (or, on a wake, permanently pause) the tape. Moving the transform in
 * the same tick as a repaint that travels through a worker is what used to
 * show a blank or truncated tape: the viewport landed on cleared canvas for as
 * long as the round-trip took. The full protocol is Spec S01, in
 * `lib/sparkline-tape.ts`.
 *
 * WHERE THE POLICY IS. Everything above is a statement about *when* — when to
 * append, when to stop, when the epoch rebases, when the tape may go inert.
 * None of it needs the DOM, and all of it is in `lib/sparkline-tape.ts`, which
 * this component drives through a {@link SparklineSurface}. What is left here
 * is the surface itself: claiming the canvas, the WAAPI scroll, the visibility
 * gate, resolving colours from computed style, and the worker wiring.
 *
 * TWO DORMANCIES, NOT ONE (Spec S02). *Flat dormancy* is the no-event state:
 * once every recognized change has scrolled off, a scrolling line that isn't
 * changing is pixel-identical to a static one, so the scroll stops and the tape
 * is inert until the next event. Change is judged in PLOT PIXELS
 * ({@link DEADBAND_PX} against the value at the last recognized change), so a
 * gauge holding a steady level — or jittering beneath what the plot can draw —
 * is as dormant as a zero rate; the reference only advances on recognized
 * change, so slow drift accumulates and eventually trips it rather than
 * ratcheting under the threshold forever.
 *
 * *Hidden pause* is different in kind: the element is off screen, so the
 * picture is ARBITRARY rather than flat, and the tape is stopped WITHOUT being
 * disturbed — no origin move, no repaint, no rebuild. Collapsing the two is
 * what made the Lens judder, because its rows cross the intersection boundary
 * constantly and each crossing rebased a picture that could not survive being
 * translated. The gate accordingly observes the nearest scroll container with a
 * generous margin and waits out a flap before believing it.
 *
 * Neither dormancy delays real activity: the wake rebuilds the tape from the
 * caller's own binned history in the tick the event fires, and re-registers
 * through the same acknowledged path. (Rule 1's "values are never revised"
 * applies to the on-screen tape; a dormant rebuild reconstructs state nobody
 * was shown.)
 *
 * REGISTRATION IS VERIFIED, NOT ASSUMED. On each live tick — and only while the
 * document is visible, because a stalled timeline would otherwise turn the cure
 * into a 4 Hz rebase storm — the scroll's actual position is compared against
 * the clock's. A sub-pixel divergence is ignored, a tiny one is corrected in
 * place, and anything the eye could catch goes back through the acknowledged
 * path.
 *
 * The sampled value is a rolling ~1s output rate, so it rises smoothly with
 * activity and falls to zero (baseline) when output stops.
 *
 * WHERE THE PIXELS ARE MADE. The tape is a `<canvas>` whose context is
 * transferred to a shared render worker, so the four-times-a-second geometry
 * write happens off the main thread and commits to the compositor without
 * waking the page. The geometry itself lives in `lib/sparkline-geometry.ts` and
 * is shared with the on-main fallback, so there is only ever one staircase
 * implementation. Control may be transferred once per element, so the canvas
 * is keyed on its geometry AND the live device pixel ratio: a resolution change
 * arrives as a new element, and the claim that follows repaints immediately so
 * no idle tape is left blank by it.
 *
 * Laws: [L13] motion is a WAAPI transform, never an rAF/timer-driven frame
 *       loop (the timer samples data, it does not animate); [L06] appearance
 *       is painted and DOM-attributed — the one piece of React state here is
 *       the device pixel ratio, which is STRUCTURE ([L24]: it decides which
 *       canvas element exists, not how anything looks); [L03] setup in
 *       `useLayoutEffect`; [L19] `.tsx`/`.css` pair; [L21] adapted algorithm
 *       noticed; [L26] a spent canvas is replaced by `key`, never
 *       re-transferred; [L27] the worker entry, the observer, the theme
 *       subscription, the visibility listener, and the animation are all
 *       released in the effects' cleanups.
 *
 * Decoupled from any data source: the caller passes `getSeries` (oldest→newest
 * bins), the bin width, and `subscribeActivity` — the data-event clock every
 * read is downstream of.

 *                 scale. The original behavior.
 *  - `gamma(g)` — power curve `x^g`. `g < 1` is STEEP through the low/mid band
 *                 (great differentiation there) and concave into the top, which
 *                 rounds off just below full scale. Reaches 1 at `x = 1`, so
 *                 pick `fullScale` above real bursts for headroom. Smaller `g`
 *                 = steeper low end. This is the current feel.
 *  - `log(knee)`— logarithmic: equal height per DOUBLING of rate. Spends its
 *                 steepness on the very-low end and flattens the mid band, so
 *                 large `knee` reads FLAT for ordinary activity — usually the
 *                 wrong trade here. Kept for comparison.
 *  - `soft(k)`  — saturating soft-knee `1 − e^(−k·x)`. NEVER clips (asymptotes
 *                 to 1); slope `k` at the origin sets low/mid steepness. Here
 *                 `fullScale` is a characteristic scale, not a ceiling. Use
 *                 when even extreme spikes must stay on-screen without a flat
 *                 top — at the cost of bursts differentiating less up high.
