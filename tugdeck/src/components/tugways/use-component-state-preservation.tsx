/**
 * useComponentStatePreservation — opt-in Component State Preservation
 * Protocol ([D13], [A9]) hook for stateful `tugways` components.
 *
 * After Phase E.8 the API has two halves, each with a single job:
 *
 *   - `useComponentStatePreservation({ componentStatePreservationKey,
 *     captureState })` — registers the component for **capture**. Per
 *     [A9a] the closure is stored in a ref synced on every render (so
 *     the framework always reads the latest render's closure, never a
 *     stale mount-time capture). The hook registers with the nearest
 *     `ComponentStatePreservationRegistry` inside a `useLayoutEffect`
 *     per [L03]: registration is in place before any event-driven
 *     consumer could call capture.
 *
 *   - `useSavedComponentState<T>(componentStatePreservationKey)` — reads
 *     the **saved** value for that key from the per-card `CardStateBag`
 *     synchronously in render. Consumed inside a `useState` initializer
 *     so the component mounts in its saved state on the very first
 *     paint. There is no post-mount "apply saved value" path: every
 *     consumer reads its saved value at render time, full stop.
 *
 *   - `useSavedRegionScroll(scrollKey)` — companion to the above for
 *     scroll positions saved on the [A9] region-scroll axis. Body kinds
 *     whose imperative renderer accepts an `initialScrollTop` (the
 *     TerminalBlock virtualized scrollport, the FileBlock CM6 mount)
 *     read this and write the saved scroll into the scroller at
 *     creation. The scroller's first observable `scrollTop` is the
 *     saved value — no jump from 0.
 *
 * Three context layers collaborate to deliver per-card saved state to
 * the right hook call:
 *
 *   - `CardComponentStatePreservationContext` carries the per-card
 *     registry reference, the accumulated scope prefix, the current
 *     scope depth (`treePath`), the saved-state accessors, and the
 *     subscribe channel that drives `useSyncExternalStore`. `CardHost`
 *     provides the root value; rendering a participating component
 *     outside any provider is supported (gallery demos, standalone
 *     tests) — `register`-side calls no-op with a single dev-warn, and
 *     the saved-state accessors return `undefined`.
 *
 *   - `<ComponentStatePreservationScope prefix>` is a context provider
 *     that prepends `prefix + "/"` to every nested
 *     `componentStatePreservationKey`, letting composite components
 *     embed other opt-in components without knowing their inner keys.
 *     Scopes nest additively; scope depth is carried in the context's
 *     `treePath` so the registry's parent-first iteration sees
 *     ancestors before descendants (per [D13] Q3 resolution).
 *
 *   - `useSyncExternalStore` is how saved-state reads enter React per
 *     [L02]. The accessor hooks subscribe to the deck manager's notify
 *     channel; future bag mutations that go through `notify()` will
 *     refresh the read. Today the typical consumption pattern (read
 *     inside a `useState` initializer) only consults the value once, so
 *     reactivity is mostly a free correctness property — but it stays
 *     correct if a future consumer reads outside an initializer.
 *
 * Opt-in: components that do not pass a
 * `componentStatePreservationKey` (or that are used outside a card)
 * carry no state preservation. Uniqueness of scoped keys at card scope
 * is enforced by the registry in dev (dev-only throw on duplicate).
 * Capture is synchronous and must not return a Promise; the framework
 * reads `captureRef.current()` during save and expects a serializable
 * value.

 *     throw, so we carry a nullable value instead of an undefined context.
 *   - `prefix` is the accumulated `<ComponentStatePreservationScope>`

 *   - `treePath` records the scope depth as a sequence of sentinel
 *     indices — one segment per enclosing
