/**
 * `useSessionCitationPortals` — a confirmed session run in prose becomes the
 * live citation chip.
 *
 * The annotator is a DOM pass: it can mark a run as a session, and it cannot
 * mount a React component into it. `TugSessionCitation` is a React component
 * with its own subscription, its own hover, its own gesture and its own
 * resolution states, and "exactly as the transcript does it" means that
 * component and not a drawing of it. Portals bridge the two, which is the
 * technique `tug-atom-markdown-body` already uses for atom chips.
 *
 * **Driven by the pass, not beside it.** Collection runs from
 * `TugMarkdownBlock`'s `onAnnotated` callback rather than from a second
 * `VerdictBatcher` subscription. A second subscription would appear to work —
 * child effects subscribe before parent effects, so the block's own re-mark
 * happens to run first — but that is an accident of tree shape. One refactor
 * moving this hook up a level would start collecting spans before the pass
 * that creates them.
 *
 * **The host list is a function of the live DOM, never an accumulation.**
 * `dropStaleWraps` may unwrap a session mark whose target stopped resolving,
 * which detaches a node React is portaling into; every pass therefore rebuilds
 * the list from what is in the container now, and an element that has left is
 * gone from it.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L03] the walk runs in the block's layout effect, before paint.
 *  - [L06] nothing here is appearance state — the hosts are IDENTITY (which
 *    element, which session), and how the chip looks is the chip's business.
 *  - [L27] `onAnnotated` is a registration and hands back its release.
