/**
 * `TugAtomRef` — the read-only atom skin.
 *
 * An **atom** is the rendering of a value somebody *placed*: an `@`-mention,
 * a tool call's `file_path` field, an entry in a Gazette post's `refs` array,
 * the sha in a commit receipt's header. An atom has exactly two skins and
 * never a third. The **editable skin** is the boxed chip (`TugAtomChip`), and
 * the box means one thing: *this object can be selected, deleted, or dragged
 * where it sits*. This is the other one — glyph + label, transparent, no
 * border — for every placed value in read-only ink. See
 * `tuglaws/entity-presentation.md`.
 *
 * The counterpart is a **mention**: characters somebody *wrote* in a
 * sentence, which render as those characters plus a resting underline once a
 * resolver confirms them (`styles/tug-annotation.css`). Placed-ness is
 * structural — recorded in the data before anything renders — so which form
 * applies is never a judgment call.
 *
 * **The label is a name, not the value.** A file atom shows its basename; a
 * commit atom shows `Commit 227a8eb9`. An atom stands with no sentence
 * around it, so the word a sentence would have supplied belongs in the
 * label — eight bare hex characters name nothing a reader can act on, and a
 * small glyph does not rescue them. A mention needs no such word, because
 * its sentence already said it.
 *
 * **Two stamping modes, because two hosts already own the contract.** In
 * `annotate` mode (the default for a file) the skin stamps the annotator's
 * file-path annotation on itself and the transcript's delegated layer
 * supplies the gesture — the same click and the same context menu a path
 * written in prose gets, so there is one interaction path for every file
 * reference rather than a parallel implementation. In presentational mode
 * it stamps nothing, for hosts that already carry the full contract: the
 * Gazette's `annotationProps` wrapper span, which also owns the pending and
 * unresolvable tooltip states, and `CommitShaText`, which owns every pointer
 * gesture on a sha. A commit skin never stamps its own — a commit
 * annotation needs the repo root and the commit's touched paths, which only
 * the host's resolver has, so `annotate` is offered on the file arm alone
 * rather than as a prop that would be silently ignored.
 *
 * **The hover follows the stamping.** A self-stamping file skin owns its
 * hover too, and it is the house {@link fileTip} in a {@link TugTooltip} —
 * not the `title` attribute this used to hand the OS. A path is an entity,
 * and an entity gets one answer wherever it is pointed at
 * (`entity-tips.tsx`); an OS-drawn box in the system font is not that
 * answer, and it cannot be themed, delayed, or dismissed with the chain.
 * In presentational mode the skin mounts nothing, because the host that
 * owns the contract owns the hover with it — the Gazette has a pending and
 * an unresolvable state to say, and a tip here would shadow them.
 *
 * Born confirmed. A placed value arrived in a field: the tool this header
 * describes just read or wrote this file, which is stronger evidence than
 * any probe. The skin carries no existence check and never waits on one.
 *
 * The link affordance rides the annotation contract rather than a modifier
 * class — an annotated skin, or a skin inside an annotated wrapper, is
 * clickable, and an unresolvable ref carries no annotation and invites
 * nothing. That is what keeps a dead Gazette ref honest with no prop
 * threading (see `tug-atom-ref.css`).
 *
 * Focus discipline (`data-tug-focus="refuse"`, `data-no-activate`) rides the
 * annotation, so clicking a ref never steals first-responder status from
 * wherever the user is typing.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] appearance is pure CSS + inherited tokens; no React state.
 *  - [L11] the ref is a control — it declares itself a reference; the deck
 *    level owns the state acting on it mutates.
 *  - [L19] file pair (`.tsx` + `.css`), exported props, `data-slot`.
