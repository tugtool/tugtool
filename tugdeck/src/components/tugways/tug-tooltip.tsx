/**
 * TugTooltip — Hover/focus tooltip wrapping @radix-ui/react-tooltip.
 *
 * Provides TugTooltipProvider (shared delay config) and TugTooltip (inline
 * API: child element becomes the trigger, content + optional shortcut badge
 * rendered inside the tooltip bubble). Supports truncation-aware mode where
 * the tooltip is suppressed when the trigger content is not actually clipped —
 * measured at the open transition, so hover and focus opens are gated alike.
 *
 * ## Keyboard model — passive, never a focus stop
 *
 * Per the keyboard model ([P01]/[P03]), the tooltip is purely passive: it
 * **never takes the key view** and is **not a Tab stop**. The bubble is Radix
 * tooltip content — non-interactive, no `tabIndex`, no `useFocusable`
 * registration — so the engine never routes keystrokes to it and the ring never
 * moves onto it. It opens on the *trigger's* focus (Radix's focus/hover open
 * path); the trigger is the real focusable and keeps the key view and the ring
 * the whole time the tooltip is showing. There is nothing to trap, descend
 * into, or restore — the surface is display-only.
 *
 * ## Chain-reactive dismissal via observeDispatch
 *
 * While the tooltip is open, TugTooltip subscribes to
 * `manager.observeDispatch`. Any action flowing through the responder
 * chain — a keyboard shortcut, a button click elsewhere, a programmatic
 * dispatch — dismisses the tooltip. Rationale: a click that triggers
 * unrelated app activity is a strong signal the user is no longer
 * interested in the hovered content, and matches the macOS convention
 * of hover-surfaced affordances evaporating on any deliberate action.
 *
 * Tooltips never self-dispatch (they are display-only), so no blinkRef
 * guard is needed. When rendered outside a ResponderChainProvider
 * (standalone previews, unit tests that don't mount a provider),
 * `useResponderChain()` returns null and the subscription is silently
 * skipped — Radix's own hover/focus dismissal keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * ## Input gestures and open menus
 *
 * Two more gates sit beside that one. A click, right-click, or scroll ends a
 * hover wherever it lands, heard at the document in the capture phase
 * (`lib/tooltip-dismiss`) — the chain never sees a right-click that only
 * raises a menu. And no bubble opens at all while a menu is on screen
 * (`lib/open-menu-registry`): a menu and a tooltip float over the same region
 * describing the same target, and the one the user did not ask for gives way.
 *
 * To gate the subscription and close the tooltip from JS, TugTooltip
 * now always tracks a local mirror of Radix's open state via
 * `onOpenChange`. In pure uncontrolled mode this is a no-op relative
 * to prior behavior — Radix still calls `onOpenChange(true/false)`
 * during hover/focus, we update the mirror, and Radix sees the mirror
 * flow back through the `open` prop. Truncation suppression and
 * controlled-mode forwarding behave exactly as before.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM — truncation measured off the live
 *       element at the open edge, not state,
 *       [L11] controls emit actions; responders handle actions,
 *       [L13] motion compliance — animation durations scale via --tug-timing,
 *       [L14] Radix Presence owns DOM lifecycle — use CSS keyframes,
 *       [L16] pairings declared, [L19] component authoring guide
