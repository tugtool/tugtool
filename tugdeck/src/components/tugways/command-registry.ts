/**
 * command-registry.ts — the canonical table of user-invocable commands.
 *
 * One entry per command the user can invoke: its wire name, its display
 * title, how it dispatches, which native menu item it drives, and which
 * chords are bound to it by default. Every emitter — the Swift menu's
 * control frames, the key pipeline, buttons, the slash bridges — resolves
 * through this table and calls `dispatchCommand` ([P01], Spec S01).
 *
 * The table is pure data. It imports the action vocabulary and the content
 * width presets — both leaves that import nothing of Tug's — so the
 * dispatcher, the keymap registry, the menu-state mirror, and the Settings
 * panes can all read it without an import cycle.
 *
 * ## What is NOT in here
 *
 * - **tugcast data frames** (`spawn_session_ok`, `session_updated`, and
 *   the ~20 siblings). They are protocol, not commands: no title, no
 *   validity, no chord. They keep the raw `registerAction` handler path
 *   ([P03]).
 * - **Form-control currency** (`set-value`, `toggle`, `select-value`,
 *   `set-color`, `activate-color-well`, `set-property`). These travel
 *   between a control and its responder; they are not user intents.
 * - **Substrate text-editing bindings** (⌃U / ⌃W / ⌥F / ⌥B, the CM6
 *   keymaps). Movement and deletion only ever target the focused text
 *   input, so they stay substrate-local.
