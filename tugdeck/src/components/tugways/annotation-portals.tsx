 * live citation chip, a commit and a path run want the app's own hover.
 * They are portal hosts discovered by the same walk, so they are collected
 * together: a surface hands `onAnnotated` to its markdown block once, and
 * renders `portals` once, rather than knowing how many kinds currently earn
 * a component.
