/**
 * TugPulse — the PULSE's two-level reading: a HEADLINE (the session's
 * standing goal) over an ACTIVITY (the operation running now).
 *
 * The component owns the typography and the geometry — face, size, weight,
 * tracking, the one shared baseline, the stacked leading — and nothing
 * else. Mount sites supply content: the legend node, the two strings, and a
 * trailing accessory (the activity sparkline). They contribute no type
 * rules of their own, so the Z2 strip and the Lens row cannot drift apart,
 * and a change made once in `tug-pulse.css` lands on both.
 *
 * Two layouts, one contract:
 *  - `inline` — the Z2 strip: legend, headline, `›`, activity, accessory,
 *    on one fixed-height bar. The headline is pinned; the activity is the
 *    run that ellipsizes.
 *  - `stacked` — the session row: the activity on its own line with the
 *    accessory past it, and a headline line above it only when the caller
 *    supplies one. The session surfaces supply none.
 *
 * Presets ({@link TugPulsePreset}) are complete typographic proposals for
 * the pair, differing only in the knobs `tug-pulse.css` declares. Adopting
 * one everywhere is a one-word change to {@link TUG_PULSE_DEFAULT_PRESET}.
 *
 * Two of the component's rules are the PULSE's own, and both are exceptions
 * to a general one:
 *  - the legend is aligned by VISUAL CENTER, not by baseline — an all-caps
 *    label beside a much larger mixed-case headline reads low on the shared
 *    baseline (see the `cap-center` rules in the CSS);
 *  - the activity truncates in the MIDDLE, not at the end — a command
 *    identifies itself at the head and names what it acts on at the tail,
 *    and an end ellipsis throws the second away (see
 *    {@link useMiddleTruncation}).
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance is CSS and data attributes, never React state;
 *       [L16] every color rule declares its rendering surface;
 *       [L19] `.tsx`/`.css` pair, `data-slot="tug-pulse"`;
 *       [L20] the legend and the accessory are the caller's own components,
 *       and keep their own tokens.
