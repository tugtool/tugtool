/**
 * The Edit-menu enablement guard.
 *
 * Cut / Copy / Paste / Delete / Select All are `routing: "native"`. The
 * chord pipeline passes them through untouched
 * (`responder-chain-provider`: natively-routed commands `return` before the
 * chain), and AppKit performs them as the `NSText` selectors against the
 * document selection (`AppDelegate.performCopy` → `NSApp.sendAction`). They
 * never enter the responder chain.
 *
 * What the chain still decides is whether the menu item is ENABLED:
 * `computeEditCapabilities` asks `chain.validateAction(COPY)`, which walks
 * from the first responder to the first node holding a handler for it
 * (`findValidationResponder`) and answers that node's `validateAction` —
 * defaulting to **true** when it declares none.
 *
 * Those two facts compose into a trap. A responder that registers one of
 * these verbs gains nothing (its handler cannot be reached by the chord or
 * the menu item) and costs something: it terminates the validation walk, so
 * the menu reports the verb as available and, if it declares no
 * `validateAction`, reports it as available unconditionally. The Edit menu
 * then offers Copy over a session chip, a terminal block, or an image
 * preview — none of which the native selector can serve — and standing
 * aside would have let the walk reach the text surface behind it, which
 * validates against a real selection.
 *
 * So: **only a surface whose content can BE the document selection may
 * register a natively-routed verb.** Everything else uses a context-menu
 * verb of its own (`COPY_COPYABLE`, `COPY_SESSION_ATOM`,
 * `COPY_ANNOTATION_VALUE`, … — the `ACTIONS_OUTSIDE_THE_TABLE` group),
 * which is menu-only by construction and never touches the Edit menu.
 *
 * The allowlist is the whole test. The natively-routed set is read from the
 * registry rather than restated here, so routing a new verb natively puts
 * it under this guard automatically.
