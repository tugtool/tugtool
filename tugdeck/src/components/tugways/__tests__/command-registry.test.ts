/**
 * The command table's own invariants.
 *
 * The table is hand-maintained and joined to the native menu by item
 * identifier, so the things that can silently rot are structural: two
 * entries claiming one id, two entries claiming one menu item, an entry
 * with no way to invoke it at all. `lintCommandTable` answers all of them
 * at once; this suite is what makes it a gate rather than a courtesy.
