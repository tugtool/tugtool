/**
 * The text-editing context menu's shortcut hints must name the chords that
 * actually fire the commands.
 *
 * Two of them didn't. Copy as Plain Text advertised ⇧⌘C — which is Session ▸
 * Show Changes, a different command entirely — and Paste as Plain Text
 * advertised ⇧⌘V. The real chords carry Option, as both the Swift Edit menu's
 * modifier masks and the keybinding map have always said.
 *
 * The hints are no longer authored: each row reads the command's live
 * binding, so the two cannot be two spellings of one fact any more. The
 * expectation table below stays because deriving the *wrong* binding is
 * still possible — it pins which chords those seven commands hold — and the
 * derivation test beside it pins that the menu is reading them rather than
 * carrying a copy.
