/**
 * `tuglaws/menus.md`'s generated sections must match the registry.
 *
 * The doc used to hand-maintain a catalog of control frames and a table of
 * chords, and both drifted — twelve separate ways, by the audit's count.
 * A doc table and a code table are two spellings of one fact, and only one of
 * them is executed, so the other is free to be wrong for as long as nobody
 * reads it carefully.
 *
 * This test removes that freedom: it regenerates the two derived regions and
 * diffs them against what is checked in. Prose outside the markers is
 * untouched — the doc's argument is written by hand, only its tables are
 * derived.
 *
 * Run with `TUG_WRITE_MENUS_DOC=1` to rewrite the regions in place instead of
 * failing, which is how a registry change is landed with its doc.
