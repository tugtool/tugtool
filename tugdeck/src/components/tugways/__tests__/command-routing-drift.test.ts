/**
 * The migration's drift guard.
 *
 * Converting the re-dispatch loops in `action-dispatch.ts` into table rows
 * is mechanical but voluminous, and a mis-transcribed `routing` turns a
 * working command into a silent no-op that no type checker catches. The
 * table below records, per command, the mechanism the pre-funnel call site
 * used — read off `action-dispatch.ts` before the loops were deleted — and
 * asserts the entry still routes that way.
 *
 * The second half is the coverage question from the other side: every wire
 * `AppDelegate.swift` can send has to land somewhere. The fixture is the
 * deduplicated `sendControl(` list from the Swift source; each wire is
 * declared a command, a bridge (a wire whose parameter selects a per-value
 * command), or a data frame, and the test holds the registry to it.
