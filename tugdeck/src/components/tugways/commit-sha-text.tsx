/**
 * `CommitShaText` — a placed commit, wearing the read-only atom skin.
 *
 * One atom shared by every surface that names a commit: the History shade's
 * rows and the `/commit` receipt's header. A sha in a receipt header or a
 * History row arrived in a *field* of a commit record — somebody placed it,
 * nobody wrote it in a sentence — so it is an atom, and it takes the same
 * read-only skin every other placed value takes ({@link TugAtomRef}). A sha
 * written in prose stays a mention and is the annotator's business, not this
 * component's. See `tuglaws/entity-presentation.md`.
 *
 * **The label carries the word.** `Commit 227a8eb9`, not `227a8eb9`: eight
 * bare hex characters name nothing a reader can act on, and a small glyph was
 * never going to rescue them. An atom stands with no sentence around it, so
 * the work a sentence would have done moves into the label. That is also the
 * spelling right-click → Copy has always written, so what the eye reads and
 * what the clipboard gets are now one string rather than two.
 *
 * This component survives the skin rather than being replaced by it, because
 * what it owns is not appearance: it owns every pointer gesture on the sha.
 * A commit atom is a copy target, not a link, and the gestures stop here so a
 * right-click in the History shade cannot fold the row out from under its own
 * menu. It therefore renders the skin **presentationally** — no annotation
 * dataset, no delegated click.
 *
 * The complete 40-char hash comes from the row's Copy button, which writes
 * the whole commit record.
