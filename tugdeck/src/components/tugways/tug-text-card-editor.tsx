/**
 * TugTextCardEditor — CodeMirror 6-backed read-write file editing surface.
 *
 * The third CM6 primitive, peer to `tug-text-editor` (the prompt
 * composer) and `tug-code-view` (the read-only viewer). Forked from
 * `TugCodeView`'s shell — same StrictMode-safe mount, Compartment
 * reconfiguration, host-owned Find UI — with the write side grafted
 * from `TugTextEditor`'s responder shape: full editing-action
 * registration, plain-text clipboard through the native bridge (no
 * atom sidecar — files are plain text), CM6 `history()` with the
 * shared undo-menu-state plugin, and a right-click context menu via
 * `useTextSurfaceContextMenu`.
 *
 * File drops ARE here, but only as file drops: bytes are copied into an
 * `assets/` folder beside the document and a standard markdown link is
 * inserted at the drop caret (`tug-text-card-editor/file-drop`). The
 * composer's caret affordance is reused; none of its atom or attachment
 * machinery is.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here (prompt-only concerns): atoms,
 * completion/typeahead, inline attachment payloads, submit/history
 * navigation, the custom caret/selection layers (native caret and
 * `::selection` work fine without atom widgets in the document).
 *
 * Document ownership: CM6 is the runtime store for the text — the
 * document never enters React state. The component binds to a
 * `TextCardStore` (the card's autosave engine) through the
 * `TextCardBridge` contract:
 *
 *   - mount seeds the document from `snapshot.seedContent`;
 *   - every user edit calls `store.noteEdit()` (arming the autosave
 *     debounce); the store reads the buffer back via `getText()` at
 *     flush time;
 *   - external-change reverts arrive via `replaceText()`, a single
 *     transaction annotated so the update listener does NOT re-arm
 *     autosave, preserving cursor/scroll as far as the new text allows;
 *   - `getPositions()`/`applyPositions()` carry cursor + scroll for
 *     the card bag (positions-only persistence).
 *
 * Full height: the host fills the card body and CM6's `.cm-scroller`
 * owns scrolling (unlike both siblings — the composer is auto-height,
 * the viewer content-sized). CM6's viewport virtualization handles
 * large documents from this configuration.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L02] document lives in CM6; React renders only from props.
 *  - [L03] mount, bridge attach, and responder registration in
 *    `useLayoutEffect`.
 *  - [L06] all appearance through CM6's DOM and the theme extension.
 *  - [L07] every handler reads `viewRef.current` / prop refs at
 *    dispatch time, never captured closures.
 *  - [L11] this component owns the caret, selection, undo stack, and
 *    disk binding — it registers as the responder for the actions
 *    that mutate them (cut/copy/paste/selectAll/undo/redo/save).
 *  - [L12] `data-tug-select="custom"` exempts the CM6 surface from
 *    SelectionGuard clipping (the editor owns selection autonomously).
 *  - [L19]/[L20] file pair, `data-slot`, `--tugx-textcard-*` slots.
 *  - [L21] CodeMirror 6 (MIT) — covered in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

  // above, so the engine resolves this editor's focus CONTRACT
  // (`view.focus()`) instead of walking the host for a tabbable child, and
  // `classifyRoute` reads that contract to route the keyboard `dom-granted`
  // when the stop takes a caret. The focusable element is the host wrapper, so
  // the ring paints on the editor's own box.
