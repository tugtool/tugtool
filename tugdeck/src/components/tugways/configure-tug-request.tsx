/**
 * ConfigureTugRequest — the gate in front of the on-demand setup wizard. Mounted
 * once as a deck-root sibling of ConfigureTug (under `TugAlertProvider`); renders
 * nothing. It watches the configure-tug-request nonce ({@link useConfigureTugRequest}) and
 * decides whether the wizard may open:
 *
 *   nothing running                 → open the wizard
 *   turns in flight → confirm       → interrupt every turn → open the wizard
 *                   → cancel        → nothing happens
 *
 * The wizard is app-modal and its steps re-run install / log-in / model
 * acquisition, so it must not come up over live work. That makes this the same
 * shape as {@link TugLogout} — an app-level orchestrator that stops turns
 * before an app-level state change — and it shares TugLogout's interrupt loop
 * and the TugAlert singleton ([L02]/[L06]).
 *
