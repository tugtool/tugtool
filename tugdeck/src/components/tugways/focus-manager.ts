/**
 * FocusManager -- tugways focus engine, per-card (the key-window model).
 *
 * Focus state is owned **per card**, not pooled deck-global. Each card is a
 * self-contained focus universe: its own focus-mode stack (cycle / card-modal
 * trap / descend), its own key view (the element keystrokes land on), its own
 * key-within, its own default-ring stack, and its own app-authored focusable
 * registry. That universe lives in a {@link FocusContext}.
 *
 * `FocusManager` is the deck **coordinator** (the AppKit *app object* to the
 * context's *key window*): it owns only deck-global settings (ring modality,
 * keyboard-access mode), the responder-chain attachment, the subscriber set +
 * version, and the **key-card** pointer plus the `cardId → FocusContext` map. Its
 * public API delegates every walk / seed / projection / engine call to the **key
 * card's** context (the active context). Switching the key card is an O(1) context
 * swap; an inactive card's context is untouched, so a mid-flow cycle, a pending
 * card-modal dialog, or a descended scope is preserved **by construction** — no
 * tagging a shared stack, no suspend/restore reconciliation.
 *
 * Data-flow direction (the inversion that keeps key-card single-sourced): the key
 * card is **activation-driven**, not focus-derived. The activation-focus channel
 * (`applyBagFocus` in `focus-transfer.ts`) calls {@link FocusManager.setKeyCard}
 * (or {@link FocusManager.adoptKeyCard}); that sets `keyCardId`, projects THAT
 * context's marks, and only then does the responder chain's `getKeyCard()` DOM
 * fallback find the just-projected key view. Projection is downstream of the key
 * card, never an independent source — so the two can never diverge.
 *
 * Default context ([L26] + the no-card invariant): when no key card is set (a
 * `new FocusManager()` in the pure-logic tests, the gallery, a standalone
 * preview), the coordinator services a single **default context**. Registering
 * with no `cardId` routes there and the walk/seed/projection all operate on it,
 * so the per-card refactor is purely additive — the focus-walk suite passes
 * unchanged against the default context, and every hook stays a clean no-op with
 * no manager.
 *
 * Co-locates `FocusManagerContext` so the provider and `useFocusable` can import
 * it without a circular dependency -- the same pattern `responder-chain.ts` uses
 * for `ResponderChainContext`.
 *
 * State-zone classification ([L24]): the per-card key-view id, focusable records,
 * and mode stack are all **structure** zone (registry + `useLayoutEffect` at the
 * hook). The `data-key-view` attribute is the **appearance** projection of the
 * key view, written directly to the DOM ([L06]) -- never React state.

   *
   * The CONTENT half is the em-card engine-hook contract
   * ([lifecycle-delegates.md]): the card registers an engine hook whose
   * `paintMirrorAsActive` focuses its text surface, and the framework's
   * single focus channel (`applyBagFocus`) invokes it — on the activation
   * route, and again via `CardHost`'s `subscribeEngineHooksChange` retry when
   * the editor binds late (create-before-mount, async file load). The

   * content settles the chain register itself through the established channel;

   * reclaim runs.

   * containment (`chain.nodeIsWithin`, the `parentId` walk), never DOM
   * containment, so a pane-modal sheet portaled outside the card's DOM
   * subtree but chain-parented into it counts as serving the card:
   *
   *  - FR already within the key card and NOT a chain ancestor of the
   *    ideal target (a finer promotion, a sibling editor the user clicked,
   *    a modal surface holding focus) → keep it.

   *    chrome click or a pre-mount `addCard` promotion left) → the coarse
   *    container is masking the card's content accelerators; promote.
   *  - FR outside the key card entirely (stranded on a previous card, on

   *    happen), and neither does a caller whose model of the active card is
   *    already stale.
   *  - **An empty register is free.** Nothing is being taken.
   *  - **The chrome allowlist** (`data-tug-chrome="non-focus-capturing"`) —
   *    the one genuinely un-modeled DOM input that survives, for chrome that
   *    briefly owns focus between interactions (drag handles, tab buttons).
