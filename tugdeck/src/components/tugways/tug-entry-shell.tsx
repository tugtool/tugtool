/**
 * TugEntryShell — the shared structural shell behind bottom-docked entry
 * surfaces: the prompt entry (`TugPromptEntry`) and the find bar
 * (`TugFindBar`).
 *
 * The shell owns the *layout positions* and their surface treatment; every
 * occupant stays host-owned:
 *
 *   - the panel root (entry surface + `:focus-within` tint),
 *   - an optional status row above the input area,
 *   - the input area wrapping the host's editor substrate (`children`),
 *   - an optional accessory row between the input area and the toolbar
 *     (the prompt entry's compose-phase attachment strip),
 *   - the toolbar: a leading-fixed slot, two equal flex spacers flanking a
 *     centred-floating slot ([D05] — the centre lands at the midpoint of the
 *     leading–trailing gap; with no leading occupant, of the full row), and
 *     a fixed-trailing slot. The toolbar is chrome: it carries
 *     `data-tug-focus="refuse"` so a click on a badge, a spacer, or an empty
 *     gap never steals first-responder from the editor.
 *
 * **Hosting rule — both classes on the same element.** Hosts pass their own
 * legacy class per zone (`className`, `inputAreaClassName`,
 * `toolbarClassName`); the shell's `.tug-entry-shell*` classes carry the
 * shared layout/appearance CSS while host-specific rules (and app-test
 * selectors) keep matching on the host classes, which live on the very same
 * elements. The shared CSS custom properties (`--tugx-entry-shell-surface`,
 * `--tugx-entry-shell-rest`, `--tugx-entry-shell-focus`) are
 * defined in `tug-entry-shell.css` and are host-referenceable the same way.
 *
 * The shell claims no focus and owns no responder. It does keep ONE derived
 * appearance bit: `data-entry-keyboard` on the root, set while the engine's
 * key view sits inside this shell's input area — "this shell's field holds the
 * keyboard". The stylesheet reads it to decide which of the deck's entry
 * shells lights its default button, since with a find bar open two are on
 * screen and only the one holding the keyboard may read as live.
 *
 * It is mirrored onto the root rather than read in place with
 * `:has(.tug-entry-shell-input-area [data-key-view])`, which is the selector
 * this obviously wants to be: **WebKit does not invalidate `:has()` when a
 * descendant's attribute changes.** The selector matches correctly under
 * `element.matches()` and the computed style still does not update — re-insert
 * the subtree and the correct style appears. So a `:has()` keyed on an engine
 * mark silently renders the state the DOM had when the subtree was last
 * built. Never key appearance on `:has()` over a projected engine attribute;
 * mirror the bit onto an ancestor, as here.
 *
 * The forwarded ref lands on the root `div` — the prompt entry composes its
 * `rootRef + responderRef` there (the substrate's `data-empty` bridge writes
 * through that root ref per [L22], and the responder-chain registration rides
 * the same element).
 *
 * Laws: [L19] component authoring, [L20] the shell styles only its own box —
 * occupants keep their own tokens, [L06] the derived bit is a DOM attribute
 * written from a mutation observer, never React state.
