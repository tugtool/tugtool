/**
 * TugSessionRow — one session, as a row.
 *
 * **One shape, three mounts.** The masthead, the Lens rows, and the
 * new-session picker rows all show the same thing, so the shape is authored
 * once, here, and each of them composes it. Nothing is hand-rolled at a mount
 * site: the component library is the consistency mechanism rather than a
 * convention three surfaces are asked to remember.
 *
 * Three levels, and the order is the reading:
 *
 *   [dot] <name> : <callsign>        ← what it IS, and whether it is working
 *   <description>                    ← what it is FOR
 *   <activity>                  ~~~  ← what it is doing, with its tape
 *
 * There used to be a fourth level between the title and the activity — a
 * standing goal — and a fifth metadata line under it. The description already
 * says what the session is for, so a standing goal beside it read as an echo;
 * and the metadata line's facts (turns, size, stamp) are the activity line's
 * rest form now (`sessionActivityRestLine`). Both are retired rather than
 * merely unused.
 *
 * There is no reorder handle among the furniture. A Lens row is carried by its
 * own surface (`block-reorder`), so every part of the row sits at the row's own
 * edge.
 *
 * The component is PRESENTATIONAL. Every part arrives as a node: the indicator
 * is the caller's phase dot, the slots are the caller's picker, the sparkline is
 * the caller's tape, and the three text levels are `React.ReactNode` so a mount
 * site can hand in filter-highlighted runs. So the Lens mounts it over live
 * stores and the gallery mounts it over fixtures, and the two cannot drift.
 *
 * ── The fit ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A {@link TugSessionRowFit} is a complete proposal for how the row packs, and
 * `inset` is the one that ships: the indicator rides the title line, so both
 * lines beneath it start at the row's own inset and gain the whole leading
 * column. Four other fits were auditioned in the gallery (`gutter`, `reveal`,
 * `wash`, `duplex`) and retired with the audition — the attribute stays because
 * it is what the packing rules select on, not because there is a choice to make.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance is CSS on data attributes, never React state;
 *       [L19] `.tsx`/`.css` pair, `data-slot="tug-session-row"`;
 *       [L20] token sovereignty — owns `--tugx-session-row-*` and composes
 *       `TugListRow` / `TugPulse` without reaching into their tokens or
 *       their internals.
