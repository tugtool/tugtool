/**
 * `FileBlock` — Layer-1 body kind for read-only file viewing.
 *
 * A thin chrome around `TugCodeView`. FileBlock owns the framed look
 * (header strip with path / language pill / line counts / `Search` and
 * `Collapse` icon buttons), the long-file collapse-by-default behavior,
 * the embedded-mode variant for `ReadToolBlock` composition, and
 * nothing else. The CM6 substrate that actually renders the file
 * lives in `TugCodeView`; the bespoke per-line renderer that this
 * file used to ship was retired because it reimplemented features
 * the project already owns through `tug-text-editor`'s CM6
 * integration — and reimplemented them badly (per-line scrollbars,
 * stale search overlay, parallel-engine drift).
 *
 * Composition:
 *  - Header (chrome strip) — `path basename` + optional language pill
 *    + "N lines" / "Showing N of M lines" counts + a trailing
 *    affordances area (fold cue + `Search` `<TugIconButton>`). Hidden
 *    when `embedded=true` because the host wrapper (e.g.
 *    `ToolWrapperChrome`) owns identity in those cases; the affordances
 *    portal into the host's actions slot instead so they survive into
 *    the embedded composition.
 *  - Fold cue — a chevron `<button>` rendered whenever the file is
 *    `overThreshold`, in both states. Icon + label swap by state
 *    (chevron-down + "N lines folded" vs chevron-up icon-only). This
 *    is the persistent toggle handle: embedded-mode hosts hide the
 *    header, so the cue must also portal into the host's actions slot
 *    or the user could expand but not collapse back.
 *  - Body — `<TugCodeView>` (expanded) or nothing (collapsed). CM6
 *    isn't mounted while collapsed so a huge file doesn't pay the
 *    mount cost until the user reveals it.
 *
 * Long-file collapse:
 *  - Lines above `collapseThreshold` (default 80, per audit §5.1) fold
 *    by default. The fold cue invites the user to reveal. The
 *    threshold is visual policy; the audit measured Read P50 at 50
 *    lines, so the 80-line threshold catches the upper ~40% — long
 *    enough to scan-or-skip, short enough not to fold the average
 *    file.
 *  - The fold cue (`BlockFoldCue`) releases the host scroller's
 *    follow-bottom lock via `useScroller().disengage` *before* the
 *    React state update. A host like `TugListView` publishes the
 *    `Scroller` façade and the call flips its `isFollowingBottom` to
 *    false, so the ResizeObserver flush triggered by the cell-height
 *    change finds `shouldAutoPin` false and does not call
 *    `pinToBottom`. Without this, expanding a file inside a
 *    `followBottom` list scrolls the cue off-screen — violating
 *    "interacting with a control does not move that control out of
 *    view."
 *
 * Embedded mode:
 *  - `embedded=true` drops the standalone frame (background, border,
 *    radius, outer margin) and the header strip. The host wrapper
 *    owns identity and affordances. CM6 still renders the body, so
 *    the embedded host gets line wrapping + selection for free.
 *
 * What this body kind does NOT do (and never will):
 *  - Render text with a bespoke DOM tree. CM6 is the canonical text
 *    engine for any file-based content (`tuglaws/component-authoring.md`
 *    §Text content); FileBlock composes the substrate, not bytes.
 *  - Implement its own find / Cmd-F bar. A card has at most one
 *    text-entry surface, and for a tide card that is the
 *    `tug-prompt-entry` — never a per-block find widget. The
 *    `TugCodeView` substrate still carries the dormant
 *    `@codemirror/search` plumbing for the future Find redesign,
 *    but FileBlock drives no find UI.
 *  - Implement click-line-to-copy. CM6's native selection + Cmd-C
 *    handles region copy more naturally and consistently across the
 *    rest of the codebase. (The bespoke per-line click gesture used
 *    to exist; it has been retired with the rest of the bespoke
 *    renderer.)
 *  - Implement syntax highlighting. The substrate is wired today
 *    with the prop, and a follow-up step bridges Shiki (or a
 *    Lezer-based grammar) into CM6 decorations without changing
 *    this file's API.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] all FileBlock-visible state (collapse) lives in React
 *    state because it controls *what* is rendered (one of two
 *    branches), not *how* a rendered element looks. The substrate's
 *    own appearance state lives in CM6 per its module docstring.
 *  - [L11] FileBlock owns no responder. The `TugCodeView` substrate
 *    registers its own selection-only responder (`copy` /
 *    `selectAll`); FileBlock just composes it.
 *  - [L19] file pair (`.tsx` + `.css`), exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot="file-body"` on the root, this docstring.
 *  - [L20] component-token sovereignty — owns the `--tugx-file-*`
 *    slot family; consumes `--tugx-block-*` directly for the shared
 *    block-surface scaffold. Position-coordination tokens
 *    (`--tugx-pin-stack-top`, `--tugx-toolblock-header-height`) are
 *    read but never overridden, per the L20 carve-out documented in
 *    `tuglaws/component-authoring.md`.
 *
 * Decisions:
 *  - [D05] two-layer split: body kind (this file) vs. tool wrapper
 *    (`read-tool-block.tsx`).
 *  - CM6 is the canonical engine for file-based text content
 *    (`tuglaws/component-authoring.md` §Text content).

  // in the card subtree on every capture moment ([A9] save).
  //
  // Mount-in-saved-state. Two write paths:
  //
  //  - **Line-relative restore (preferred).** When the saved bag
  //    carries `meta.line = { number, offsetPx }` (the writer
  //    effect below serializes this on every commit), the first
  //    mount of CM6's view computes
  //    `lineBlockAtPos(state.doc.line(number).from).top + offsetPx`
  //    and writes that as `scrollDOM.scrollTop`. Content-anchored,
  //    so a brief font-load reflow leaves the *same line* at the
  //    viewport top — sub-pixel font-metric drift is the worst
  //    case.
  //
  //  - **Pixel fallback.** When the bag has no `meta.line` (legacy
  //    sessions, or future tools whose scroll state is too granular
  //    for a line anchor), the raw saved `y` is written directly.
  //
  // The `initialFileScrollConsumedRef` one-shot keeps the write
  // tied to the FIRST mount per CM6 view instance. A later
  // collapse→expand cycle remounts the view; the new instance's
  // ref is fresh and the saved value applies again (correct: the
  // user wants to land back at the same place after expanding).
  // The element-identity-gated MutationObserver pass in
  // `card-host.tsx` covers any later scroller-rebuild path; the
  // saved value flows from `bag.regionScroll[key].y` either way.
