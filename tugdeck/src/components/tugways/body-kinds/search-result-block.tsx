/**
 * `SearchResultBlock` — Layer-1 body kind for grouped search results.
 *
 * A *list-shaped* body kind ([#bk-conformance] item 9): like
 * `PathListBlock` ([#step-15]) it is built on `TugListView` rather than
 * rendering rows by hand, so it inherits the data-source contract and
 * consistent cell wrappers. `GrepToolBlock` ([#step-16]) composes it
 * `embedded` for its content mode.
 *
 * Composition (mirrors `PathListBlock` / `JsonTreeBlock`):
 *  - Header (standalone only) — an optional identity `label`, the file
 *    + match counts, an optional "truncated at N files" indicator, and
 *    a trailing actions cluster (Copy). In `embedded` mode the header
 *    is suppressed and the cluster portals into the host
 *    `BlockChrome`'s actions slot.
 *  - Body — a `TugListView` in `inline` mode (every row rendered, no
 *    windowing). The block grows to its natural height and the *outer*
 *    transcript scrolls; it is not boxed into an inner scroller. Rows
 *    are of two kinds: a clickable file-header row and a match row.
 *
 * Grouping + collapse:
 *  - Results are grouped by file. Each file gets a collapsible header
 *    row (twist chevron + path + match count); clicking it folds the
 *    file's match rows away. Collapse is logical UI state — it changes
 *    *which* rows exist, not how a row looks ([L06]) — so it lives in
 *    React state and is persisted through the [A9] component-state
 *    axis.
 *
 * Match rendering:
 *  - Each match row shows the matched line (line number + text with
 *    the match span highlighted) and any surrounding context lines
 *    above / below it, rendered dimmer. The highlight is driven by
 *    explicit char `spans` carried on the match — no regex is executed
 *    at render time, so a complex or invalid pattern can never break
 *    the render.
 *  - A match carries a `preview` rather than a line: the windows of the
 *    line worth showing, each knowing the column it starts at. Stretches
 *    of line between them draw as elisions, which is what keeps a hit
 *    inside a minified bundle a row rather than a wall. Spans stay in
 *    whole-line coordinates throughout and are rebased per window at
 *    render time.
 *  - File paths use the shared `MiddleEllipsisPath` ([#bk-conformance]
 *    item 8) — the same CSS-driven middle-ellipsis the file tool
 *    wrappers use.
 *
 * What this body kind does NOT do:
 *  - Render a text-entry / find field. A card has at most one
 *    text-entry surface ([#bk-conformance] item 2); this block
 *    *displays* search results — the query comes from the `Grep` tool
 *    call, not an in-block input. SearchResultBlock renders zero
 *    `<input>` / `<textarea>` elements.
 *  - Own row interaction. Click-to-open is opt-in (`openable`) and
 *    defaulted off, so a `Grep` tool result stays display-only. When a
 *    consumer opts in — the refs block a `/search` run renders into —
 *    each match row stamps the annotator's `file-path` annotation and
 *    the transcript's delegated layer supplies the click and the
 *    context menu, exactly as `PathListBlock`'s rows do. No handler,
 *    and no responder, is added here ([L11]).
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] collapse state is logical state (which rows exist) → React
 *    state; row hover and the match highlight are pure CSS.
 *  - [L11] SearchResultBlock owns no responder. Copy is a
 *    `BlockCopyButton` (a self-contained control); the file-header
 *    toggle is a plain click on an inert row, no first-responder
 *    dependency.
 *  - [L19] file pair (`.tsx` + `.css`), exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot="search-result-body"` on the root, this docstring.
 *  - [L20] component-token sovereignty — owns `--tugx-search-*`;
 *    consumes `--tugx-block-*` for the shared block scaffold and
 *    cascade-tunes `--tugx-list-view-*` for its instance.
 *  - [L23] collapse state survives reload via
 *    `useComponentStatePreservation`.
 *
 * Decisions:
 *  - [D05] two-layer split: this body kind owns result rendering; the
 *    tool block (`GrepToolBlock`) owns chrome.
