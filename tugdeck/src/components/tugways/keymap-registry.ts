/**
 * keymap-registry.ts — funnel #2: the one place a chord becomes a command.
 *
 * The command registry says what a command's default bindings are; this
 * module answers the questions a keyboard raises about them. Two of those
 * questions are cheap and one is the reason the module exists:
 *
 * - `matchChord` — the global layer's O(1) lookup, what the key pipeline runs
 *   on every keydown.
 * - `menuChords` — which chord each menu item should carry, for the push.
 * - `resolveChord` — **who actually gets this chord**, as an ordered stack
 *   with a winner and a shadower per loser.
 *
 * ## Why shadowing is the point
 *
 * A chord in Tug can be claimed at four layers, and they are not peers. In
 * the shipped app AppKit resolves an `NSMenuItem` key equivalent *before the
 * web view sees a keydown at all*, so a menu-eligible chord preempts every
 * scoped binding regardless of focus ([P15]). Below that, the JS pipeline
 * resolves focus mode first, then the responder walk innermost-first, then
 * global ([P08]).
 *
 * The codebase already knows this and reasons about it by hand: `pdf-view.tsx`
 * declines ⌘1–⌘3 because the deck wants them, and declines the zoom chords
 * outright because "they belong to the host's View menu and never reach the
 * web view at all." That comment is a hand-maintained shadowing analysis.
 * `resolveChord` is what answers it instead.
 *
 * ## What this module cannot see, and takes as input
 *
 * Two of the four layers are runtime facts owned elsewhere: scoped bindings
 * live in the components that declare them (read through the responder
 * chain), and a menu item's live enablement lives in the menu-state mirror.
 * A registry that imported either would be a cycle, and one that cached
 * either would be stale. So they arrive through a {@link KeymapEnvironment}
 * the registry is handed — which is also what lets every resolution case be
 * unit-tested against a constructed multi-layer world.
