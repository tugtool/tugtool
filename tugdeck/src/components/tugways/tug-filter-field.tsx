/**
 * TugFilterField — the filter affordance for a long list.
 *
 * A small text field that trims the list beside it: every keystroke narrows,
 * the ✕ (or Escape) restores. It is a *trimming* control, not a search box —
 * it never jumps to a result, it only removes what the user is plainly not
 * looking for. Pair it with a list whose data source applies
 * `filterQueryMatch` to the query it reports.
 *
 * ## The delegate
 *
 * Behavior flows through a {@link TugFilterFieldDelegate}, the house delegate
 * shape (`tuglaws/lifecycle-delegates.md`): one object, optional methods are
 * no-ops, the field fires each moment unconditionally.
 * `filterFieldDidChangeQuery` is REQUIRED — a filter field with no change
 * consumer means nothing. Calls are synchronous; a keystroke filter has none
 * of the timing hazards the card-lifecycle drain queue exists to solve.
 *
 * Two sanctioned wirings, both in the tree today:
 *  - **React-state adapter** — the host holds the query in `useState` and its
 *    delegate's `filterFieldDidChangeQuery` calls the setter, which flows back
 *    into the list's data source as an input (the session picker, `/resume`).
 *  - **Module-store adapter** — the field and the list are siblings that
 *    cannot see each other, so the delegate writes a module store the list
 *    body reads through `useSyncExternalStore` (the Lens sections, via
 *    `lens-filter-store.ts`).
 *
 * ## Nothing to filter
 *
 * `disabled` is for a list that is EMPTY, not one that has been filtered empty
 * — see the prop. The distinction is the whole safety of the feature: the
 * filtered-to-zero state is the one where the field is the only way back, so it
 * must stay live there, while a list with no items at all has no query worth
 * offering. A disabled field goes gray, refuses the caret, and registers no
 * focus stop, so the Tab walk passes a dead control by.
 *
 * ## Value authority and resets
 *
 * The `<input>` is uncontrolled: the DOM owns the text, `defaultValue` seeds
 * it, and the ✕'s visibility is a `data-empty` attribute flipped in the input
 * handler — no React state, no re-render per keystroke ([L06]). Reset the
 * field from outside by remounting it with a React `key` (the picker keys its
 * field on the project path).
 *
 * ## Escape, and why it is not a `stopPropagation`
 *
 * Escape must clear a non-empty filter *without* dismissing the sheet or
 * section around it, and must fall through to that surface's own ladder when
 * the field is already empty. Two arbiters decide Escape before a React
 * handler ever runs, so the field declines/claims at both:
 *
 *  - In a **focus mode** (a sheet, a trapped surface) the engine's Escape
 *    ladder runs first. Its first rung is the key view's `captures`
 *    predicate — so the field declares, live, that it captures `Escape` while
 *    its query is non-empty. The ladder yields and the field's own keydown
 *    clears it.
 *  - In the **base focus mode** (the Lens) a bare Escape resolves through the
 *    static keybinding map to `CANCEL_DIALOG` and dispatches into the
 *    responder chain. The field registers a `CANCEL_DIALOG` handler that
 *    exists *only while the query is non-empty* (an accessor on the actions
 *    map, which the chain reads live per dispatch) — so an empty field is not
 *    a handler at all and the walk continues to the surface above.
 *
 * Both paths read the same DOM value, so there is one source of truth for
 * "is there a filter to clear".
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via DOM attributes + CSS, never React state;
 *       [L03] responder registration in a layout effect (via `useResponder`);
 *       [L11] the ✕ is a control that emits, the field handles;
 *       [L17]/[L20] one-hop component-tier aliases, composed children keep
 *       their own tokens; [L19] file pair + `data-slot`.
