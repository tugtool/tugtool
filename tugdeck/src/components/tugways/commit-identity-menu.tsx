/**
 * useCommitIdentityMenu — the right-click menu a commit row offers, for the
 * whole row.
 *
 * A History row shows a hash, a subject, a stamp, and — expanded — a message
 * and a file roster, and until this hook the only press that meant anything
 * was the one that landed on the eight characters of the sha, which opened a
 * single-item Copy of those same eight characters. Every other pixel of the
 * row fell through to the app's "No Actions" fallback: the subject, the stamp,
 * the whole background. The facts a reader actually wants out of a commit —
 * the FULL hash, the message, the paths it touched — were reachable from no
 * menu at all.
 *
 * So: ONE menu, claimed by the row, listing every act the row can offer.
 *
 *   Show Detail / Hide Detail   the row's own fold, named rather than remembered
 *   ─────
 *   Copy Commit Hash            the complete 40 characters, which nothing shows
 *   Copy Short Hash             the 8 the row shows, the form a sentence quotes
 *   Copy Subject                the subject line alone
 *   Copy Message                subject + body, the message as written
 *   Copy Commit Record          the whole record — the row's Copy button's text
 *   ─────
 *   Copy Changed Files          the paths, one per line
 *
 * **The fold item says which way it goes.** `Show Detail` on a collapsed row,
 * `Hide Detail` on an expanded one — the same act the row's click performs,
 * spelled so the menu never asks the reader to recall the row's state.
 *
 * Copy Changed Files is DISABLED rather than absent when the commit changed
 * none (a merge, an empty commit): a menu whose height changes commit to
 * commit is a menu whose items move under the pointer between one right-click
 * and the next.
 *
 * `TugEditorContextMenu` rather than the Radix-backed `TugContextMenu`, for the
 * reason {@link useSessionIdentityMenu} uses it: its items write to the
 * clipboard inside the mousedown, and it moves no focus — a History row is
 * chrome, and a copy from it must not take the key view away from the shade's
 * Done button.
 *
 * Laws: [L11] controls emit actions, responders handle them — every item is a
 *       typed action dispatched to this hook's own responder;
 *       [L06] no appearance passes through React state.
