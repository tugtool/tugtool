/**
 * `TugMarkdownBlock` — non-virtualizing markdown renderer.
 *
 * The natural-flow sibling primitive to `TugMarkdownView`. Both share
 * the WASM lex/parse + DOMPurify sanitize pipeline via
 * `parseMarkdownToSanitizedBlocks`; only their layout surfaces
 * differ:
 *
 *   - `TugMarkdownView` owns its own scroll container + windowing
 *     engine, suitable for whole-document logs (1 MB+ content,
 *     thousands of blocks).
 *   - `TugMarkdownBlock` renders every block in document flow with
 *     no scroll container, no spacers, no virtualization — the host
 *     (a list cell, a card body, etc.) owns scroll and layout. It is
 *     designed for per-cell or per-message markdown content where
 *     the content size is bounded.
 *
 * Two modes, mutually exclusive at mount:
 *
 *   1. **Static `initialText` mode** — `<TugMarkdownBlock initialText="..." />`.
 *      Parses + renders the supplied text in `useLayoutEffect` so
 *      the content is painted before the first browser frame.
 *      Subsequent `initialText` prop changes are ignored. Routes
 *      through `renderIncremental(el, text)` for code-path uniformity
 *      with streaming mode — against an empty container the reconciler
 *      appends every block fresh, so the output is identical to a
 *      one-shot bulk render. The returned `RenderState` is discarded
 *      since initial-text mode is mount-once and never re-renders.
 *
 *   2. **Streaming `streamingStore` mode** —
 *      `<TugMarkdownBlock streamingStore={store} streamingPath="text" />`.
 *      On mount, reads `store.get(streamingPath)` synchronously and
 *      renders that current value (the [#md-block-api] G1
 *      contract — `PropertyStore.observe` does NOT fire on subscribe,
 *      so a cell that mounts while the store already holds content
 *      would otherwise render empty until the next emission). Then
 *      subscribes via `store.observe(streamingPath, listener)` and
 *      reconciles on each emission via `renderIncremental` — the
 *      reconciler walks per-block content hashes against the
 *      previous render's hashes and mutates only what changed
 *      (in-place `innerHTML` rewrites preserve wrapper-element
 *      identity, which preserves the browser's scroll anchor).
 *      The previous render's hashes are recovered from the
 *      container's own children (`data-content-hash`), so the diff
 *      is stateless across calls: a Fast Refresh module reload or a
 *      strict-mode remount that would wipe a module-level cache
 *      cannot make the reconciler duplicate (or blank) blocks that
 *      are already on screen. Bursts are coalesced via
 *      `requestAnimationFrame`.
 *
 * Both modes write sanitized HTML directly to the DOM — there is no
 * React state for the rendered content per [L06]. The only React
 * state is the container element ref.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L03] `useLayoutEffect` for the mount-render and the streaming
 *    subscription so DOM is in place before paint.
 *  - [L06] appearance changes go through CSS / DOM, never React
 *    state.
 *  - [L19] component authoring guide — file pair (`.tsx` + `.css`),
 *    module docstring, exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot="tug-markdown-block"`.
 *  - [L20] component-token sovereignty — reuses `--tugx-md-*` tokens
 *    only; no new tokens introduced.
 *  - [L22] streaming-binding observes the `PropertyStore` directly
 *    and writes DOM imperatively, bypassing the React render cycle
 *    for per-delta updates.
 *  - [L23] streaming mode preserves user scroll position by routing
 *    every delta through the incremental reconciler ([#step-18-8]),
 *    which preserves the DOM element identity that browser scroll
 *    anchoring depends on.
 *
 * Decisions:
 *  - [D09] `TugMarkdownBlock` is a sibling primitive, not a flow
 *    mode on `TugMarkdownView`.
 *  - [D06] streaming cells observe the streaming source directly via
 *    this primitive's `streamingStore` mode.
