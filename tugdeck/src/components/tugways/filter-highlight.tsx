/**
 * filter-highlight — paint a list-filter query's matched spans inside a row.
 *
 * One renderer for every filtered list (the session picker, the `/resume`
 * overlay, the Lens sections, the gallery filter card), so a match looks the
 * same wherever it is found. The output is inline fragments — plain strings
 * and `<mark class="tug-filter-mark">` spans — which compose into a
 * `TugListRow`'s `title` / `subtitle` and therefore keep the row's typography,
 * truncation, and selected-state recolor. Nothing here reaches for the
 * `children` escape hatch.
 *
 * Two entry points, for the two shapes text arrives in:
 *  - {@link renderFilterHighlight} for a plain string.
 *  - {@link renderFilterHighlightSpans} for text already cut into styled runs
 *    (a syntax-highlighted commit message body), where the marks must nest
 *    INSIDE the existing tones instead of replacing them.
 *
 * **Pass the string you render.** Ranges come from the `text` argument
 * ({@link filterHighlightRanges}), so a caller that truncates or collapses
 * whitespace for display must pass that *display* string — ranges taken from
 * the raw source field would paint at the wrong offsets.
 *
 * An unfiltered row costs nothing: an empty query (or a string no term
 * matches) returns the bare string, so the row's DOM is byte-identical to its
 * unfiltered self.
 *
 * The paint is `--tugx-find-match-bg` — the one find-paint token family
 * ([L17]), shared with transcript find and the Text card's code view, so a
 * theme tunes "a match" in one place.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS; [L17] one-hop component-tier alias;
 *       [L20] token sovereignty — the mark paints its own background only.

 * The plain {@link renderFilterHighlight} cannot serve text that already
 * carries styling — a syntax-highlighted commit message body, say — because it
 * takes one string and owns the whole output. This takes the runs instead and
 * subdivides them: a match that straddles two runs is marked in both halves,
 * each keeping its own tone. `.tug-filter-mark` sets `color: inherit`, so a
 * marked run reads as its own tone under the highlight rather than losing it.
 *
 * `spans` MUST cover `text` exactly, in order — the ranges are offsets into
 * `text` and are walked against the runs' cumulative lengths. An empty query
 * (or a line no term matches) renders the runs untouched, so unfiltered text is
 * byte-identical to its unstyled-by-this-function self.
