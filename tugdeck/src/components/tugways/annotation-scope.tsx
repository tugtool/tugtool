/**
 * The annotation scope — how a block deep in the transcript gets the
 * annotator without being handed it.
 *
 * The annotator needs live inputs (the command catalog, the path
 * resolvers) that only the transcript host can assemble. Passing those
 * down as props works for the handful of components the host renders
 * directly, and fails for everything below them: a Bash tool block is many
 * levels down, renders its command line itself, and would have needed
 * every ancestor to agree to forward a prop it does not otherwise care
 * about. That is why tool headers went unannotated — not a decision, a
 * consequence of the plumbing.
 *
 * So the inputs travel as React context and a block opts in with one hook:
 *
 * ```tsx
 * const ref = useAnnotatedElement<HTMLElement>([command]);
 * return <code ref={ref}>{command}</code>;
 * ```
 *
 * Outside a provider the hook is inert, so a component that also renders
 * in a gallery or a non-transcript surface needs no conditional.
 *
 * **Laws:** [L03] — marking runs in `useLayoutEffect`, because the
 * transcript's delegated click and context-menu listeners resolve a
 * gesture by reading these marks; a mark applied in a passive effect could
 * miss a gesture in the frame it was painted. [L06] — the hook writes DOM
 * attributes and classes only; whether something looks clickable is CSS
 * reading those attributes, never React state.
 *
