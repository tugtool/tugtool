/**
 * TugListView — windowed list primitive modeled on UIKit's `UITableView`.
 *
 * A framework-level primitive for any surface in tugdeck that renders a
 * list of items: the Tide multi-turn transcript (the first consumer), the
 * session picker (deferred migration), an eventual history panel, a
 * permission/audit log, and so on. The shape borrows directly from
 * UIKit's table-view decomposition — a *data source* enumerates items
 * and their kinds; a *delegate* opinionates on heights, lifecycle, and
 * selection; an imperative handle exposes scroll-into-view; cell
 * renderers are registered per kind so the same data source can mix
 * heterogeneous row shapes through one call site.
 *
 * **Step 2 boundary — types only.** This commit ships the public API
 * surface as TypeScript types plus a no-op stub component. The full
 * implementation (windowing, height index, cell reuse, lifecycle,
 * SmartScroll integration) lands in subsequent steps. Consumers can
 * write data sources and cell renderers against the contract today.
 *
 * Laws:
 * - [L02] external state enters React via `useSyncExternalStore` — the
 *   list view subscribes to the data source through that contract.
 * - [L03] registrations events depend on (SmartScroll, ResizeObserver,
 *   lifecycle delegate) land in `useLayoutEffect` so they're in place
 *   before paint.
 * - [L06] appearance changes via CSS / DOM — spacer heights and scroll
 *   position writes go directly to the DOM, not through React state.
 * - [L11] the list view holds no chain handlers in v1; no scroll-action
 *   vocabulary exists yet for it to register against. Cell renderers
 *   may be controls or responders depending on their content.
 *   `delegate.onSelect` is a control-style action emitted on cell click;
 *   selection state lives with the consumer ([Q06] / [D03]) — except
 *   in opt-in `selectionRequired` mode, where the list view owns a
 *   never-null selected index (local-data zone [L24]; React state is
 *   sanctioned for "selected item in a list") and mirrors it to the
 *   consumer through the `onSelectionChange` state-mirror callback.
 * - [L19] component authoring guide — file pair, module docstring,
 *   exported props interface, `data-slot="tug-list-view"`.
 * - [L20] component-token sovereignty — `--tugx-list-view-*` only;
 *   consumers customize via cascade-scoped overrides.
 * - [L22] store observers may write DOM directly. Streaming-bound cells
 *   observe their stream sources from inside their renderers; the
 *   list view does not push deltas through its own subscribe path.
 * - [L23] scroll position survives DOM-down transitions via the
 *   consumer-supplied `scrollKey` written to `data-tug-scroll-key`.
 * Decisions:
 * - [D01] UITableView lineage; [D02] single-section flat list in v1;
 *   [D03] imperative handle with `scrollToIndex` + `getElementForIndex`;
 *   [D04] cell reuse is a conceptual API — v1 implementation is React
 *   item-keyed mount/unmount; [D07] SmartScroll owns scroll-position
 *   writes; [D08] no chain-driven scroll commands in v1.
 *
 * Row roles:
 * - The data source may classify each item as a `"cell"` (the
 *   default), a `"header"`, or a `"footer"` via the optional
 *   `TugListViewDataSource.roleForIndex` method. Cells with a non-
 *   default role render with `data-list-cell-role` set on the wrapper,
 *   are NOT focusable (`tabIndex={-1}`), and do NOT fire
 *   `delegate.onSelect` on click or Space/Enter — they are inert
 *   section dividers. Visibility lifecycle (`willDisplay` /
 *   `didEndDisplaying`) and ResizeObserver measurement still apply,
 *   so headers and footers participate in windowing math identically
 *   to ordinary cells. Cell renderers may attach their own click
 *   handlers if a header/footer needs an action; the primitive's
 *   gating is purely about wrapper-level selection dispatch. See
 *   `tugplan-tide-picker-redesign.md` [D02] for the rationale and the
 *   relationship to a future `numberOfSections` migration.
 *
 * Filtering:
 * - `TugListView` itself does NOT host a search field or own a
 *   filter predicate. UIKit's `UITableView` doesn't either —
 *   `UISearchController` projects a filtered data source the table
 *   consumes. The same split applies here: a host component owns the
 *   search input (a `TugInput` or any other text surface) and
 *   composes a `FilteredTugListViewDataSource` via
 *   `useFilteredDataSource` (in `./use-filtered-data-source.ts`). The
 *   wrapper's filtered enumeration is fed to `<TugListView
 *   dataSource={...} />` in place of the base — the primitive doesn't
 *   know it's filtered, and the consumer doesn't have to teach it.
 *   See `gallery-list-view-filter` for the canonical pattern (host-
 *   owned `TugInput` + `useFilteredDataSource` + `baseIndexFor`-aware
 *   cell renderer) and `tugplan-tide-picker-redesign.md` [D01] /
 *   [Spec S06] for the rationale.

 * `delegate.estimatedHeightForKind`. Cell-lifecycle delegate
 * dispatch (`willDisplay` / `didEndDisplaying` / `onSelect`) sits on
 * top: a per-commit layout effect diffs the rendered index set
 * against the previous commit and notifies the delegate of
 * transitions; the cell wrapper's `onClick` handler fires
 * `onSelect`. Auto-follow-bottom is handled by a post-commit pin
 * effect plus the per-cell / container `ResizeObserver` callbacks,
 * all of which route through `SmartScroll.maybePinToBottom` — the
 * single owner of the `isFollowingBottom && !isUserScrolling` gate.
 *
 * What's stable today:
 * - DOM shape per the plan's [#dom-shape]: scroll container,
 *   top spacer, window div with one wrapper per rendered cell, bottom
 *   spacer.
 * - Cell wrapper carries `data-tug-list-cell-index` and
 *   `data-tug-list-cell-kind` for test addressability, observer
 *   index lookup, and (later) reuse-pool routing. Wrappers for cells
 *   whose `roleForIndex` is `"header"` or `"footer"` additionally
 *   carry `data-list-cell-role` set to that value, render with
 *   `tabIndex={-1}`, and short-circuit the wrapper-level `onSelect`
 *   dispatch on click and Space/Enter keydown — see the top-of-file
 *   "Row roles" docstring for the full contract.
 * - Spacer heights write directly to the DOM via `style.height`
 *   ([L06], mirroring `TugMarkdownView`).
 * - Imperative handle: `scrollToIndex` routes through SmartScroll
 *   ([D07]). Rendered target → `scrollToElement`. Unrendered
 *   target → two-pass precision protocol per [D03]: pass 1 is an
 *   estimated `scrollTo` jump; pass 2 (post-commit correction
 *   effect, threshold 4px) reconciles after the target row mounts
 *   and is measured. Out-of-range indices clamp to first/last; NaN
 *   and empty data sources are no-ops. `getElementForIndex` reads
 *   from a ref map populated by cell wrapper refs.
 * - `ResizeObserver` callbacks coalesce via `requestAnimationFrame`
 *   ([R01] mitigation): rapid sequential resize events from the
 *   browser fold into one rerender per paint frame. [L05] forbids
 *   RAF for state-commit-dependent ops; this RAF is callback-
 *   coalescing, not commit-waiting.
 * - Delegate lifecycle: `willDisplay` fires before
 *   `didEndDisplaying` for transitions in the same commit; both
 *   fire in numeric-ascending order; `onSelect` fires on cell click.
 *   Lifecycle dispatch is purely about visibility transitions inside
 *   a live list view — list-view unmount does not synthesise
 *   `didEndDisplaying`.
 * - Auto-follow-bottom: pinning is gated by
 *   `smartScroll.isFollowingBottom` and `!smartScroll.isUserScrolling`,
 *   read from the live instance per [L07]. User scroll-up disengages
 *   via SmartScroll's own scroll-event handling; idle-at-bottom
 *   re-engagement is also SmartScroll's job.
