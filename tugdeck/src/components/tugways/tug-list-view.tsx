/**
 * TugListView — windowed list primitive modeled on UIKit's `UITableView`.
 *
 * A framework-level primitive for any surface in tugdeck that renders a
 * list of items: the Dev multi-turn transcript (the first consumer), the
 * session picker (deferred migration), an eventual history panel, a
 * permission/audit log, and so on. The shape borrows directly from
 * UIKit's table-view decomposition — a *data source* enumerates items
 * and their kinds; a *delegate* opinionates on heights, lifecycle, and
 * selection; an imperative handle exposes scroll-into-view; cell
 * renderers are registered per kind so the same data source can mix
 * heterogeneous row shapes through one call site.
 *
 * **Step 2 boundary — types only.** This commit ships the public API
 * surface as TypeScript types plus a no-op stub component. The full
 * implementation (windowing, height index, cell reuse, lifecycle,
 * SmartScroll integration) lands in subsequent steps. Consumers can
 * write data sources and cell renderers against the contract today.
 *
 * Laws:
 * - [L02] external state enters React via `useSyncExternalStore` — the
 *   list view subscribes to the data source through that contract.
 * - [L03] registrations events depend on (SmartScroll, ResizeObserver,
 *   lifecycle delegate) land in `useLayoutEffect` so they're in place
 *   before paint.
 * - [L06] appearance changes via CSS / DOM — spacer heights and scroll
 *   position writes go directly to the DOM, not through React state.
 * - [L11] the list view holds no chain handlers in v1; no scroll-action
 *   vocabulary exists yet for it to register against. Cell renderers
 *   may be controls or responders depending on their content.
 *   `delegate.onSelect` is a control-style action emitted on cell click;
 *   selection state lives with the consumer ([Q06] / [D03]) — except
 *   in opt-in `selectionRequired` mode, where the list view owns a
 *   never-null selected index (local-data zone [L24]; React state is
 *   sanctioned for "selected item in a list") and mirrors it to the
 *   consumer through the `onSelectionChange` state-mirror callback.
 * - [L19] component authoring guide — file pair, module docstring,
 *   exported props interface, `data-slot="tug-list-view"`.
 * - [L20] component-token sovereignty — `--tugx-list-view-*` only;
 *   consumers customize via cascade-scoped overrides.
 * - [L22] store observers may write DOM directly. Streaming-bound cells
 *   observe their stream sources from inside their renderers; the
 *   list view does not push deltas through its own subscribe path.
 * - [L23] scroll position survives DOM-down transitions via the
 *   consumer-supplied `scrollKey` written to `data-tug-scroll-key`.
 * Decisions:
 * - [D01] UITableView lineage; [D02] single-section flat list in v1;
 *   [D03] imperative handle with `scrollToIndex` + `getElementForIndex`;
 *   [D04] cell reuse is a conceptual API — v1 implementation is React
 *   item-keyed mount/unmount; [D07] SmartScroll owns scroll-position
 *   writes; [D08] no chain-driven scroll commands in v1.
 *
 * Row roles:
 * - The data source may classify each item as a `"cell"` (the
 *   default), a `"header"`, or a `"footer"` via the optional
 *   `TugListViewDataSource.roleForIndex` method. Cells with a non-
 *   default role render with `data-list-cell-role` set on the wrapper,
 *   are NOT focusable (`tabIndex={-1}`), and do NOT fire
 *   `delegate.onSelect` on click or Space/Enter — they are inert
 *   section dividers. Visibility lifecycle (`willDisplay` /
 *   `didEndDisplaying`) and ResizeObserver measurement still apply,
 *   so headers and footers participate in windowing math identically
 *   to ordinary cells. Cell renderers may attach their own click
 *   handlers if a header/footer needs an action; the primitive's
 *   gating is purely about wrapper-level selection dispatch. See
 *   `tugplan-session-picker-redesign.md` [D02] for the rationale and the
 *   relationship to a future `numberOfSections` migration.
 *
 * Filtering:
 * - `TugListView` itself does NOT host a search field or own a
 *   filter predicate. UIKit's `UITableView` doesn't either —
 *   `UISearchController` projects a filtered data source the table
 *   consumes. The same split applies here: a host component owns the
 *   search input (a `TugInput` or any other text surface) and
 *   composes a `FilteredTugListViewDataSource` via
 *   `useFilteredDataSource` (in `./use-filtered-data-source.ts`). The
 *   wrapper's filtered enumeration is fed to `<TugListView
 *   dataSource={...} />` in place of the base — the primitive doesn't
 *   know it's filtered, and the consumer doesn't have to teach it.
 *   See `gallery-list-view-filter` for the canonical pattern (host-
 *   owned `TugInput` + `useFilteredDataSource` + `baseIndexFor`-aware
 *   cell renderer) and `tugplan-session-picker-redesign.md` [D01] /
 *   [Spec S06] for the rationale.

/**
 * `TugListView` implementation — windowing + cell reuse + delegate
 * lifecycle + SmartScroll-driven scroll-position writes, layered on
 * a sparse height index.
 *
 * The list view subscribes to the data source via
 * `useSyncExternalStore` ([L02]). A `SmartScroll` instance bound to
 * the scroll container owns every programmatic scroll-position
 * write per [D07]; its `onScroll` callback drives the re-window
 * tick. Cell heights flow through a `HeightIndex`: a single
 * `ResizeObserver` instance observes every rendered cell wrapper;
 * observer callbacks update the index, queue a single rAF flush,
 * and force a re-window on flush. Unmeasured indices fall back to
 * `delegate.estimatedHeightForKind`. Cell-lifecycle delegate
 * dispatch (`willDisplay` / `didEndDisplaying` / `onSelect`) sits on
 * top: a per-commit layout effect diffs the rendered index set
 * against the previous commit and notifies the delegate of
 * transitions; the cell wrapper's `onClick` handler fires
 * `onSelect`. Auto-follow-bottom is handled by a post-commit pin
 * effect plus the per-cell / container `ResizeObserver` callbacks,
 * all of which route through `SmartScroll.maybePinToBottom` — the
 * single owner of the `isFollowingBottom && !isUserScrolling` gate.
 *
 * What's stable today:
 * - DOM shape per the plan's [#dom-shape]: scroll container,
 *   top spacer, window div with one wrapper per rendered cell, bottom
 *   spacer.
 * - Cell wrapper carries `data-tug-list-cell-index` and
 *   `data-tug-list-cell-kind` for test addressability, observer
 *   index lookup, and (later) reuse-pool routing, plus
 *   `data-row-parity` — the row's index parity, which alternating row
 *   tint reads instead of `:nth-child` (windowing slides the rendered
 *   range, so child order is not row order). Wrappers for cells
 *   whose `roleForIndex` is `"header"` or `"footer"` additionally
 *   carry `data-list-cell-role` set to that value, render with
 *   `tabIndex={-1}`, and short-circuit the wrapper-level `onSelect`
 *   dispatch on click and Space/Enter keydown — see the top-of-file
 *   "Row roles" docstring for the full contract.
 * - Spacer heights write directly to the DOM via `style.height`
 *   ([L06], mirroring `TugMarkdownView`).
 * - Imperative handle: `scrollToIndex` routes through SmartScroll
 *   ([D07]). Rendered target → `scrollToElement`. Unrendered
 *   target → two-pass precision protocol per [D03]: pass 1 is an
 *   estimated `scrollTo` jump; pass 2 (post-commit correction
 *   effect, threshold 4px) reconciles after the target row mounts
 *   and is measured. Out-of-range indices clamp to first/last; NaN
 *   and empty data sources are no-ops. `getElementForIndex` reads
 *   from a ref map populated by cell wrapper refs.
 * - `ResizeObserver` callbacks coalesce via `requestAnimationFrame`
 *   ([R01] mitigation): rapid sequential resize events from the
 *   browser fold into one rerender per paint frame. [L05] forbids
 *   RAF for state-commit-dependent ops; this RAF is callback-
 *   coalescing, not commit-waiting.
 * - Delegate lifecycle: `willDisplay` fires before
 *   `didEndDisplaying` for transitions in the same commit; both
 *   fire in numeric-ascending order; `onSelect` fires on cell click.
 *   Lifecycle dispatch is purely about visibility transitions inside
 *   a live list view — list-view unmount does not synthesise
 *   `didEndDisplaying`.
 * - Auto-follow-bottom: pinning is gated by
 *   `smartScroll.isFollowingBottom` and `!smartScroll.isUserScrolling`,
 *   read from the live instance per [L07]. User scroll-up disengages
 *   via SmartScroll's own scroll-event handling; idle-at-bottom
 *   re-engagement is also SmartScroll's job.

      // and legitimate — so it is pinned with `noteExternalWrite` and
      // recorded as an `extent-rebase` trace event, never repaired.

    // iteration order is already ascending.

            set React is rendering right beside it — one piece of geometry,
            and it must land in ONE mutation batch.

            Writing it from a `useLayoutEffect` instead splits that geometry
            across React's commit boundary. The mutation phase removes the
            evicted rows and their combined extent — thousands of pixels on
            a transcript — leaves the document; the layout phase puts it
            back. In between, the document is short by exactly that amount,
            and layout is lazy, so this is harmless right up until something
            forces layout in that window. Then the browser clamps `scrollTop`
            to the short maximum and does NOT restore it when the spacer
            grows back microseconds later — the user's position is simply
            gone. Plenty of readers sit in that window: every child layout
            effect (children run before parents), the front-insert
            scroll-hold's `scrollHeight` read, the ring-height effect's
            `clientHeight` read.

            Rendering the height closes the window by construction rather
            than by hunting readers, so a sixth reader added later cannot
            reopen it. `windowResult` is already computed in the render body
            and already decides which rows are rendered, so nothing new is
            calculated and no new render is scheduled.

            Do not re-add a DOM-side writer alongside this one: React skips
            re-applying a `style` value it believes unchanged, so the two
            would go stale against each other. `TugMarkdownView` reaches the
            same atomicity imperatively — `applySpacers` runs in the same
            synchronous task as its block add/remove loops. */}

            //    un-authored, non-subordinate list. A `focusGroup` listbox

            //    of the native Tab order (`tabIndex={-1}`) and carries
