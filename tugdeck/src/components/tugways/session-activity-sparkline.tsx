/**
 * SessionActivitySparkline — one session's activity tape, wherever it is drawn.
 *
 * The tape is a fixed reading of a fixed series: the session's composite of
 * RATE work — characters, tokens, tool calls, subagents — over the window the
 * instrument shows, at the size and curve `tug-session-row` declares. Nothing
 * about it varies by surface, which is why it is one component rather than a
 * shape each mount assembles from the same six constants.
 *
 * It was two. The masthead's `MastheadSparkline` and the Lens row's
 * `RowSparkline` were the same component under two names — same store, same
 * series, same rate-channel filter, same bin, same full scale, same curve, same
 * box, same title — and the only thing that told them apart was which file they
 * were written in. Two copies of one instrument is the state where a fix to the
 * channel filter lands on one surface and not the other, and the reader is left
 * comparing two graphs of the same work that do not agree.
 *
 * **Filtered to rate channels.** A gauge level moves whether or not the session
 * is working — a context-window fill is a level, not a rate — so a gauge write
 * must not wake this tape. The filter is `isRateChannel`, applied in the
 * subscription rather than in the series, because the wake is what costs.
 *
 * The instrument itself samples imperatively off React's render path and
 * scrolls under WAAPI; this component's whole job is to hand it the two
 * callbacks and the session's numbers ([L06]/[L13]).
 *
 * Laws: [L06] the tape is canvas and CSS, never React state; [L13] motion is
 *       the instrument's; [L20] `TugSparkline` is composed through its
 *       published props only.
