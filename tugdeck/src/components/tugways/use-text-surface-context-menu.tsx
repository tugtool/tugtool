/**
 * useTextSurfaceContextMenu — single source of truth for right-click
 * context menus on text-bearing surfaces.
 *
 * Consolidates the menu-state, the secondary-click guard, the contextmenu
 * pipeline, and the `TugEditorContextMenu` render across four surfaces: the
 * editor host (`tug-text-editor`), the markdown view (`tug-markdown-view`), the
 * native-input responder (`use-text-input-responder`), and the transcript cells
 * (`dev-card-transcript`). The consumer's `TextSelectionAdapter` is query-only
 * (`hasRangedSelection` / `getSelectedText` / `selectAll`); this hook owns the
 * React-side wiring that's identical across them.
 *
 * Each consumer:
 *   - Constructs an adapter for its surface and passes it by ref.
 *   - Calls `useTextSurfaceContextMenu({ adapterRef, capabilities, ... })`.
 *   - Attaches the returned `onMouseDown` / `onContextMenu` to its surface
 *     element (React event props or a native listener).
 *   - Renders the returned `menu` somewhere in its tree (it portals).
 *   - Registers its own COPY/CUT/PASTE/SELECT_ALL handlers on the responder
 *     chain (surface-specific: CodeMirror's clipboardExt, native execCommand,
 *     virtualized select-all CSS visual, etc.).
 *
 * Right-click pipeline:
 *
 *   1. `onMouseDown(event)` — **stop the secondary-click selection clobber at
 *      the source.** For a secondary-click (right-click or macOS Control-click =
 *      button 0 + ctrlKey) over a *ranged* selection it calls `preventDefault`,
 *      so the surface never moves the caret to the click point on mousedown
 *      (which would collapse the selection). No snapshot, no restore — the
 *      selection simply isn't disturbed. (The CM6 editor stops its own pointer
 *      selection with an equivalent guard in its `domEventHandlers.mousedown`.)
 *
 *   2. `onContextMenu(event)` — `preventDefault` (suppress the system menu),
 *      sample `hasSelection` from the live selection
 *      (`adapterRef.current.hasRangedSelection()`), open the menu at the click
 *      point. The selection is already intact from step 1.
 *
 *   3. `hasSelection` drives `buildTextEditingMenuItems({ hasSelection, canEdit
 *      })` so Cut / Copy / Paste / Select All enablement is consistent across
 *      every surface.
 *
 * Optional `hasSelectionOverride`: a consumer can provide a function
 * that the hook calls *instead of* sampling from the adapter. The
 * markdown view uses this to fold its "logical select-all" CSS-visual
 * flag into Copy enablement — its virtualized select-all paints a CSS
 * class instead of holding a DOM Selection, so the menu's Cut / Copy
 * gates need to reflect the flag, not just the DOM range.
 *
 * Tuglaws cross-check:
 *   - [L02] no external store enters via this hook; menu open/close
 *     is `useState` (data the menu owns).
 *   - [L06] menu visibility (open / closed) is React state because the
 *     menu's lifecycle is structural — the portal mounts and
 *     unmounts based on it. Selection mutations stay in the DOM
 *     via the adapter; we never mirror selection into React state.
 *   - [L07] handlers register via the consumer's `useResponder` and
 *     are reached via the menu's `useControlDispatch` (targeted to
 *     `parentId`) inside `TugEditorContextMenu`; this hook never
 *     closes over stale handler closures — it doesn't own handlers.
 *   - [L11] the menu items dispatch typed `TugAction`s to the parent
 *     responder via `useControlDispatch` (`sendToTarget(parentId)`),
 *     the canonical "control dispatches to its parent responder"
 *     shape used by every other tugway control. The consumer must
 *     render the returned `menu` inside its own `<ResponderScope>`
 *     so `parentId` resolves to the consumer's responder; the
 *     editor, the markdown view, and the transcript cells already
 *     do this, and `useTextInputResponder` wraps the menu inside
 *     the input's scope before returning it.
 *   - [L12] selection mutations route through the adapter, which
 *     respects whatever boundary discipline `SelectionGuard` enforces
 *     for the surface's card.
 *   - [L19] component-authoring conventions: file pair (.tsx + this
 *     module docstring), exported props interface, no `data-slot`
 *     since the hook renders no DOM of its own (the menu's slot is
 *     `tug-editor-context-menu`).
 *   - [L23] adapters JS-commit selection so user-visible state
 *     survives the `preventDefault` that suppresses the system menu.
 *   - [L24] zone discipline: menuState (data) → React state, menu
 *     visibility (structure) → React render, menu hover paint
 *     (appearance) → CSS in tug-menu.css.
