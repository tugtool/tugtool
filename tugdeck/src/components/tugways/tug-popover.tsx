/**
 * TugPopover — Anchored interactive popup wrapping @radix-ui/react-popover.
 *
 * Exposes a compound API: TugPopover (root), TugPopoverTrigger (trigger),
 * TugPopoverContent (styled chrome with portal, arrow, animation), and
 * TugPopoverClose (re-export of Radix Close). Focus is trapped inside the
 * popover; Escape closes it and returns focus to the trigger.
 *
 * ## Chain-native open state
 *
 * TugPopover owns its open state internally and exposes an imperative
 * handle (`TugPopoverHandle`) with `open()` / `close()` / `isOpen()` for
 * consumers (like `TugConfirmPopover`) that need to drive the popover
 * programmatically. There is no `open` / `onOpenChange` prop pair —
 * dismissal flows through the responder chain via `cancelDialog` /
 * `dismissPopover` rather than through a React callback. [L11]
 *
 * ## Responder registration lives on TugPopoverContent
 *
 * The chain responder is registered by `TugPopoverContentShell`, a
 * nested component rendered INSIDE `Popover.Content` and therefore
 * mounted only while Radix actually shows the popover. Two reasons:
 *
 * 1. `TugPopover` has no DOM node of its own — it's a state owner and
 *    Radix Root wrapper. The responder needs a DOM element to carry
 *    `data-responder-id`, and that element is the portaled content.
 * 2. The shell's lifecycle matches the popover's open lifecycle.
 *    Registering at mount and unregistering at unmount keeps the
 *    auto-first-responder promotion (see
 *    `ResponderChainManager.register`) from stealing focus from
 *    inner composites (e.g. `TugConfirmPopover`'s own inner
 *    responder) that mount in the same commit and expect to become
 *    first responder themselves. If the responder hook ran at
 *    `TugPopoverContent`'s outer level it would register even when
 *    `open=false` — the component function still evaluates to
 *    produce JSX for Radix's Presence wrapper — and the effect
 *    would auto-promote at initial mount, blocking the inner
 *    composite's walk forever.
 *
 * **This is a structural contract, not a code invariant.** The fix
 * relies on `Popover.Content` returning null when not open, so its
 * children (including our shell) are not in the React tree during
 * the closed state. If a future change makes `TugPopoverContent`
 * eagerly render its children (e.g. wrapping everything in
 * `<Popover.Content forceMount>` for custom exit animations), the
 * shell will start mounting at initial render, its responder will
 * auto-promote, and inner composites will break. The first
 * regression is visible in `tug-confirm-popover.test.tsx`'s
 * `dispatching confirmDialog resolves the promise with true` case —
 * the walk fails to reach the inner confirm handler and the test
 * resolves with `false`. Keep that test passing, and this structural
 * contract stays intact.
 *
 * The `cancelDialog` and `dismissPopover` handlers both close the
 * popover via a `close` callback passed through the
 * `TugPopoverInternalContext` from the root.
 *
 * ## Radix-level dismissal → chain dispatch
 *
 * When Radix's own DismissableLayer closes the popover (Escape,
 * click-outside, explicit `TugPopoverClose` activation), the internal
 * `handleOpenChange` on the root runs and:
 *
 * 1. Flips internal state to false so React re-renders Radix as closed.
 * 2. Dispatches `dismissPopover` through the responder chain so any
 *    inner composite (e.g. `TugConfirmPopover`) whose responder is
 *    registered under the popover content can observe the dismissal
 *    via `observeDispatch` and resolve its pending promise. Without
 *    this re-emission, consumers would have no chain-native way to
 *    hear about Radix-initiated closes and their Promise adapters
 *    would hang.
 *
 * The action is `dismissPopover`, NOT `cancelDialog`, because
 * `cancelDialog` is also handled by `TugSheet`. A popover rendered
 * inside a sheet that auto-dismisses (click-outside, Escape) cannot
 * assume the popover's own responder is the first responder at the
 * moment the dismissal fires — the walk routinely starts at the
 * picker form / card and proceeds upward via parentId. With
 * `cancelDialog`, that walk passes the popover and lands on the
 * sheet's handler, closing the surrounding sheet. `dismissPopover`
 * is popover-private (only `TugPopoverContentShell` handles it), so
 * the walk either lands on the shell and stops or falls off the
 * chain harmlessly. Inner composites still observe the dispatch
 * unchanged because `observeDispatch` does not filter by action.
 *
 * The dispatch carries the popover's own `senderId`, so the
 * `observeDispatch` subscription in `TugPopoverContent` filters it
 * out and does not schedule a second close.
 *
 * **Undocumented Radix assumption.** This design relies on Radix
 * firing `onOpenChange` ONLY in response to user-initiated DOM
 * dismissal (Escape, click-outside, TugPopoverClose activation), not
 * in response to our own controlled prop flipping from `true` to
 * `false`. This has held across the Radix versions we've shipped
 * on, but it is not an invariant Radix documents explicitly. If a
 * future Radix release starts firing `onOpenChange` on every
 * controlled close, every programmatic `close()` will cascade
 * through `handleOpenChange` and emit an extra `dismissPopover` —
 * not wrong semantically (both the shell's responder handler and
 * any inner resolver are idempotent once `resolverRef` is nulled),
 * but noisy. If the gallery starts showing duplicate close
 * animations or tests start seeing double-resolve warnings, check
 * Radix's release notes first.
 *
 * ## External dismissal via observeDispatch
 *
 * While the popover is open (i.e. `TugPopoverContent` is mounted), the
 * content subscribes to `manager.observeDispatch`. Any chain action
 * whose sender is not this popover closes the popover via the
 * context `close` callback. This matches the `tug-popup-menu` /
 * `tug-editor-context-menu` precedents for chain-reactive dismissal.
 *
 * Rendered outside a `ResponderChainProvider`, `useOptionalResponder`
 * no-ops, the `observeDispatch` subscription is skipped, and the
 * popover still works as a plain Radix popover — but consumers that
 * rely on chain-dispatched dismissal (e.g. `TugConfirmPopover`
 * resolving its promise on Escape) will silently degrade. Standalone
 * previews and unit tests should mount inside a provider to exercise
 * the chain-native paths.
 *
 * ## Dismissal on a layout change
 *
 * A popover is anchored to its trigger by Radix's Popper. Radix
 * dismisses on a `pointerdown` outside the popover and repositions
 * when the trigger itself resizes or scrolls — but it does not catch
 * the trigger being *moved* by an ancestor resizing: a pane
 * drag-resize, a window resize. The trigger's own box is unchanged,
 * so none of Radix's observers fire, and the popover is left
 * anchored where it opened while the trigger slides away.
 *
 * `TugPopoverContentShell` closes the popover on those layout
 * changes. While open it watches the trigger's layout ancestors
 * (captured via `triggerElRef`) with a `ResizeObserver` — any
 * ancestor resizing means the trigger has shifted — plus a `window`
 * `resize` listener. RO callbacks run after layout and before
 * paint, so the popover is hidden synchronously and then closed
 * before a detached frame can render or its exit animation can play
 * stranded. Chasing the trigger with a per-frame reposition loop
 * would be the wrong tool ([L05] / [L13]).
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM, never React state,
 *       [L11] controls emit actions; responders handle actions,
 *       [L13] motion compliance — animation durations scale via --tug-timing,
 *       [L14] Radix Presence owns DOM lifecycle — use CSS keyframes,
 *       [L16] pairings declared,
 *       [L17] component aliases resolve to base tier in one hop,
 *       [L19] component authoring guide
 *
 * @see ./internal/floating-surface-notes.ts for the cross-surface
 *      invariants table (popover / confirm-popover / alert / sheet)
 *      and the chain-reactive vs. modal semantic models.
 *
 * ## Status-cell anchor pattern
 *
 * When the trigger is not an obvious-affordance element (a button), the
 * substrate contract requires the consumer to supply the hover hint —
 * `TugPopoverTrigger` itself adds no cursor or background change. The
 * canonical pattern for status-row cells (the Z2 layout's TIME / TOKENS
 * / CONTEXT cells and the `TugProgressIndicator`) is to wrap the cell in
 * `TugPopoverTrigger` and apply a `cursor: pointer` + subtle
 * hover-tinted background class so the click target is discoverable.

 *    imperative-control popovers — i.e., a popover whose visibility is
 *    driven by a parent's logic (matrix branches, async work, etc.)
 *    rather than a single click on a button.
 *  - **Virtual-anchored** (`virtualRef` prop): the anchor element is

 *    a child cell, etc.). Renders no DOM of its own. Lets one popover

 * choreography (X buttons with pointer-capture, controls that have

 * toggle and the imperative `open()` call. The toggle reads the
 * `open` prop from its closure at click time; if the popover state
 * has updated between event phases (e.g., between `pointerup` and
 * `click` when the parent's pointerup handler already opened the
 * popover imperatively), the toggle inverts and immediately closes
 * what just opened. Using Anchor + imperative open avoids this
 * because no `onClick` toggle is composed onto the host element.

  //    so we do not schedule a redundant close.
  //
  // 2. Dispatches originating from inside the popover (e.g. a
  //    TugSwitch toggle or TugInput commit dispatched from a form
  //    control nested within the popover content) should not dismiss
  //    their own container. We detect this by checking whether
  //    `document.activeElement` is inside our content element — if
  //    the user's focus is on a control inside the popover, the
  //    dispatch was their interaction with the popover, not a
  //    signal to close it. Without this filter, the Form Content
  //    gallery example (popover containing an input, a switch, and
  //    a save button) would self-dismiss on every field change.
  //
  // **The focus-inside filter is a heuristic.** It assumes that
  // `document.activeElement` accurately reflects "the user is
  // interacting with the popover", which is true for the cases we
  // care about (text input focused, Safari's click-without-focus
  // on buttons leaving focus on the last field) but can be fooled
  // by a programmatic dispatch that happens to run while focus is
  // inside the popover — e.g. a timer firing a shortcut action
  // while the user is typing. The filter will skip such a
  // dispatch and keep the popover open, even though the dispatch
  // may have represented a legitimate "close now" signal. This is
  // an acceptable trade-off for now: keeping form-content popovers
  // usable is more important than dismissing on weird background
  // traffic, and users can always press Escape or click outside.
  // Revisit if a concrete use case surfaces where this trade-off
  // goes the wrong way.

 * (no chain-native responder in scope), the function falls back to
 * calling the context `close` callback directly so the popover still

 *
 * The action is `dismissPopover`, not `cancelDialog`, for the same
 * reason `handleOpenChange` re-emits `dismissPopover` (see the file
 * docstring's "Radix-level dismissal → chain dispatch" section):
 * `cancelDialog` is also handled by `TugSheet`, so dismissing a

 * close the sheet too. `dismissPopover` is popover-private.
 *
 * When called outside a TugPopover context, the returned function is a
 * no-op.
 *
 * Distinct from the `focus-inside-popover` filter that protects
