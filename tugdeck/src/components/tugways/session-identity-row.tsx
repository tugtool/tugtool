/**
 * SessionIdentityRow — one session, resolved and rendered. The single component
 * every surface that shows a session mounts.
 *
 *   [dot] <name> : <callsign>        ← what it IS, and whether it is working
 *   <description>                    ← what it is FOR
 *   <activity>                  ~~~  ← what it is doing, with its tape
 *
 * {@link TugSessionRow} is the SHAPE — presentational, every part a node it is
 * handed. This is the shape with the stores behind it: the identity, the
 * description ladder, the activity ladder, the phase dot, and the tape, all
 * resolved once here rather than at each mount site.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point of the file. The shape was already shared
 * — the masthead, the picker, and the Lens all mounted `TugSessionRow` — and
 * the surfaces still drifted, because everything that DECIDES what goes into
 * the shape was written three times. Three description ladders (two of which
 * had three rungs and one two), three activity ladders (one with a compaction
 * pin, one without, one with a dwell queue), three spellings of the
 * `pulse/enabled` gate, and two copies of the sparkline. A shape can only make
 * three surfaces agree about how a row PACKS; it cannot make them agree about
 * what a row SAYS. This can.
 *
 * ── The three knobs ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The surfaces genuinely differ in three ways, and only three, so those are
 * declared props and everything else is one answer:
 *
 *  1. **{@link SessionIdentityRowProps.dotSize}** — the indicator's glyph box.
 *     The dense mounts (chrome, the picker's rows) take
 *     {@link TUG_SESSION_ROW_STACK_DOT_SIZE}; the Lens's monitor rail takes
 *     {@link TUG_SESSION_ROW_INDICATOR_SIZE}. ONE number, used for both the dot
 *     and the ink-slack correction the title is measured by — those were two
 *     props at every mount site, and two numbers that must agree is one number
 *     with a way to be wrong.
 *  2. **`subAlign`** — whether the two sub-lines hang off the title or off the
 *     row's own edge. `TugSessionRow`'s knob, forwarded; see
 *     {@link TugSessionRowSubAlign}.
 *  3. **{@link SessionIdentityRowProps.tape}** — whether the activity
 *     sparkline draws. The picker's rows are a list to pick FROM rather than a
 *     monitor, so they carry none, and a row reserving width for a graph it does
 *     not draw is width taken from the text for nothing.
 *
 * Everything past those three is either the same on every surface (both
 * ladders, the beat grammar, the `pulse/enabled` gate) or is a piece of the
 * mount's own furniture handed straight through (the Lens's slot picker, the
 * picker's badges and trash, the masthead's popovers and copy handles).
 *
 * ── The description ladder ([D132]) ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The agent's rolling synopsis, else the session's own first prompt, else the
 * date it was created. The lower two are facts STANDING IN for a line nobody
 * has written yet, so they are marked and painted a step quieter.
 *
 * All three rungs on every surface. The Lens carried only two, on the argument
 * that its rows are always bound live cards and so never reach the prompt rung
 * — which, if true, makes the rung free, and if false makes it the one
 * human-meaningful line the row could have shown.
 *
 * ── The activity ladder ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A caller's override, else the compaction pin, else the live beat, else the
 * rest sentence. The overrides exist for facts a row knows that the pulse feed
 * cannot report — a session held by a terminal, a row whose one fact is that it
 * failed to resume.
 *
 * The feed is read only when {@link SessionIdentityRowProps.beats} says this row
 * is live, and that gate is load-bearing rather than an optimization:
 * `latestLineForScope` answers with app-wide ambience for any scope, so a closed
 * session's row would otherwise narrate whatever the app happened to be saying.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] every store enters through `useSyncExternalStore` (inside the
 *       hooks); [L06] appearance is CSS on data attributes, never React state;
 *       [L20] `TugSessionRow` is composed through its published props only.
 * Decisions: [D123] one name, produced in one place; [D132] one row, three
 *       surfaces.
