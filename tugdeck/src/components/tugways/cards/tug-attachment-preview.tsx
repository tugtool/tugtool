/**
 * tug-attachment-preview.tsx — the general-purpose attachment-preview
 * facility, shared by the transcript (read-only) and the prompt-entry
 * editor (compose phase, deletable).
 *
 * It has two faces, both driven by the per-card {@link AtomBytesStore}:
 *
 *  - the **strip** ({@link TugAttachmentPreview}): a row of thumbnail
 *    tiles, one per image atom, mounted below a user-row body in the
 *    transcript (a fixed-width, wrapping grid) OR as the prompt-entry's Z4C
 *    zone while composing (a single-row, fixed-HEIGHT strip — see the CSS
 *    pair for the two layouts and why the compose one is height-driven).
 *    Each tile paints, in order: the baked `thumbnailDataUrl`; else the
 *    full-resolution bytes the moment they land (the replay window, before
 *    the bake); else a transparent reserved slot — never a dark box.
 *  - the **sheet** ({@link AttachmentPreviewSheet}, internal): the
 *    full-resolution image, opened in a pane-sheet when a tile is
 *    clicked, with ←/→ paging across the message's image set and a Copy
 *    action. The strip owns the sheet via {@link useTugSheet}, so a
 *    consumer drops in `<TugAttachmentPreview …/>` and gets click-to-zoom
 *    for free.
 *
 * Delete: when `deletable` is set (the compose phase — you can't delete an
 * attachment already committed to the transcript), each tile grows a ✕
 * affordance and the sheet a Delete action. Both are [L11] controls: they
 * dispatch `REMOVE_ATTACHMENT` (the atom id on `value`) through the chain
 * to the parent responder, which owns the substrate (editor doc + bytes
 * store) and performs the removal. The strip holds no delete state; it
 * re-renders from the shrunken atom array the responder produces.
 *
 * Density: `compact` steps both faces down for a surface a few hundred pixels
 * wide (the Gazette rail) — smaller tiles, a sheet that opens at the narrow
 * width tier short of the host card's edges, and that sheet's chrome (Copy,
 * Delete, Done) at the smaller button scale, since three card-scale buttons
 * are most of what a rail-width footer holds. It is a size, never a different
 * design: same tiles, same captions, same sheet, same gestures. The default is
 * the card's.
 *
 * The bytes-store IS external state: its contents grow on the live path
 * (drop / paste / synthesize) and on the replay path (synthesizer mints
 * entries from JSONL content blocks; thumbnail bake fires fire-and-forget
 * and updates the entry when complete). Both faces subscribe via
 * `useSyncExternalStore` so a late-arriving thumbnail lands as a
 * re-render rather than leaving a tile stuck on its placeholder.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L02] external state (the bytes store) enters React via
 *    `useSyncExternalStore`; the strip snapshot is the per-atom
 *    thumbnail-data-URL projection, stable across quiescent rebuilds.
 *  - [L06] appearance via CSS — tile dimensions, gap, caption
 *    typography, placeholder, hover wash, and the sheet's aspect-lock
 *    all flow from this component's slot family + CSS.
 *  - [L11] the ✕ / Delete are controls — they dispatch `REMOVE_ATTACHMENT`
 *    through the chain; the parent responder owns the delete state.
 *  - [L19] file pair, module docstring, exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot="tug-attachment-preview"` on the strip root.
 *  - [L20] one component-token slot family (`--tugx-attachment-*`).
