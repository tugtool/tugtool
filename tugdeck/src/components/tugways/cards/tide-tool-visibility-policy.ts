/**
 * tide-tool-visibility-policy.ts — the single editable source of truth
 * for how Claude Code tool names render (or do not render) in the
 * Tide transcript.
 *
 * # The three buckets
 *
 * Every Claude Code tool name falls into exactly one of three
 * classifications. Two are *explicit* in this file; one is *implicit*
 * in `tide-assistant-renderer-dispatch.ts`:
 *
 *  1. **bespoke** — *implicit*. A tool has a bespoke wrapper iff it is
 *     registered in `TOOL_BLOCK_REGISTRY` via `registerToolBlock`
 *     (e.g. `BashToolBlock`, `ReadToolBlock`, `EditToolBlock`). These
 *     names MUST NOT appear in `TOOL_VISIBILITY_POLICY` — that would
 *     be a double-classification. The governance test pins this.
 *
 *  2. **hidden** — *explicit* (this file). The tool's per-call events
 *     paint zero ink in the transcript. The dispatch derives a
 *     `HIDDEN_TOOL_NAMES` set from `hiddenToolNames()` and intercepts
 *     these names in `resolveToolBlock` *before* the registry lookup,
 *     returning the shared `NullToolBlock` factory. `detectToolCallDrift`
 *     also short-circuits these names so a hidden tool never raises
 *     an `unknown_tool` caution. Use this bucket for control-channel
 *     machinery the user doesn't need to see (`ToolSearch`,
 *     `ScheduleWakeup`, `EnterPlanMode` / `ExitPlanMode`,
 *     `PushNotification`). `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` were
 *     historically hidden here under the original [D100] decision,
 *     but [#step-24-3-5] introduced the `TaskInlineToolBlock`
 *     second-surface marker — both names are now bespoke (registered
 *     via the dispatch's `BESPOKE_REGISTRATIONS`), and the policy
 *     no longer claims them.
 *
 *  3. **default-intent** — *explicit* (this file). The tool currently
 *     renders through `DefaultToolBlock` (the JsonTree fallback) and
 *     does not raise an `unknown_tool` caution, but a bespoke wrapper
 *     is planned and named. The dispatch derives
 *     `AUDIT_CONFIRMED_DEFAULT_TOOLS` from `defaultIntentToolNames()`
 *     so the drift detector treats these names as "known, JSON-tree
 *     is fine for now." Every entry's `rationale` MUST cite the
 *     follow-on step (`#step-...`) — the governance test enforces
 *     that, so a default-intent entry is always an *explicit TODO*,
 *     never a forever-bucket.
 *
 * # Why this file exists
 *
 * Before this file, the dispatch carried a flat `AUDIT_CONFIRMED_DEFAULT_TOOLS`
 * set that overloaded two policies onto one container: low-volume tools
 * whose JSON-tree default rendering is genuinely fine, AND control
 * tools that should ideally be silenced. Mixing the two made the
 * intent of any given entry unreadable — and made adding a new "hide
 * this" tool require touching the dispatch internals. This file
 * separates the two and gives each entry an audit trail (rationale +
 * `reviewedAt`) so the bucket choice can be defended on review.
 *
 * # Editing this file
 *
 * Moving a tool between buckets is a one-line change:
 *  - Add or move an entry in `TOOL_VISIBILITY_POLICY`.
 *  - Update its `rationale` to reflect the new bucket.
 *  - Bump `reviewedAt` to commit day.
 *  - Run `bun test tide-tool-visibility-policy.test.ts` — the governance
 *    test enforces the invariants below.
 *
 * Promoting a tool to bespoke means:
 *  - Add a `registerToolBlock("<name>", MyToolBlock)` call in the
 *    dispatch.
 *  - REMOVE the tool's entry from `TOOL_VISIBILITY_POLICY` (it would
 *    fail the no-double-classification test otherwise).
 *
 * # Invariants (enforced by `tide-tool-visibility-policy.test.ts`)
 *
 *  - (a) Every entry's `name` is lowercase; `visibility` is in the
 *    enum; `rationale` is non-empty; `reviewedAt` is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
 *  - (b) No entry's `name` is also in `TOOL_BLOCK_REGISTRY` after
 *    module load (bespoke and policy-classified are mutually
 *    exclusive).
 *  - (c) Every `default-intent` entry's `rationale` contains
 *    `"Awaiting"` and `"#step-"` (explicit ownership of the planned
 *    bespoke wrapper).
 *  - (d) Every name in `V2_1_148_CANONICAL_TOOL_NAMES` (hardcoded in
 *    the test) is covered by either `TOOL_BLOCK_REGISTRY` or this
 *    policy — so a new tool added to a future Claude Code release
 *    fails CI until it is explicitly classified.
 *
 * # Scope — MCP is intentionally excluded
 *
 * The `mcp__*` namespace is a variable, user-installed surface. Per the
 * project policy in `roadmap/tide-assistant-rendering.md` (the MCP
 * non-goal in Open Questions, the deferred-stub Step 24.3.5), MCP
 * tools are **not** classified here. `mcp__*` names continue to route
 * through `DefaultToolBlock` and produce `unknown_tool` cautions; the
 * caution count is the deferral's signal. Do not add an `mcp__*`
 * pattern entry to this file without first reopening the MCP decision.
