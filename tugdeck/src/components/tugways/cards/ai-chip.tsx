/**
 * `AiChip` — the Z4B composite AI settings chip.
 *
 * One chip where three stood: `MODE`, `AI MODEL`, and `EFFORT` were three
 * faces of one question — how the AI runs — and three chips plus three pickers
 * is chrome, not information. This is a two-line `TugPushButton` carrying an
 * `AI Model Settings` caption over `Fable 5 · High · Auto` (model · effort ·
 * mode), and pressing it opens the one mixer sheet ([ai-config-sheet.tsx]).
 * The Claude Code version chip stands beside it, unmerged
 * ([session-route-indicator-badge.tsx]) — it reports the runtime, not a
 * setting, so it keeps its own face, changelog click, and drift report.
 *
 * **Nothing is lost in the merge.** Each value resolves through the same single
 * helper its old chip used — `resolveModelLabel`, `resolveEffortDisplay`,
 * `resolvePermissionMode` — so the composite reads byte-identically to the
 * faces it replaces, with the effort token OMITTED (not dashed) when the model
 * supports none. Right-click keeps the value chips' copy affordance
 * (`useCopyableButton`), now covering the whole composition in one string.
 *
 * **It sizes to what it says.** The chip is deliberately NOT width-stabilized:
 * stabilization exists to stop a row of chips from shuffling sideways when one
 * of them changes, and the collapse left Z4B with two. With nothing downstream
 * to push around, a fixed width bought only a permanent margin of empty chip,
 * so the face is a plain span and the button is as wide as the settings it is
 * reporting.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] every value enters through `useSyncExternalStore` on the
 *       metadata store; [L06] no React state for appearance — the copy menu's
 *       disclosure belongs to `useCopyableButton`'s popover; [L19]/[L20]
 *       composes `TugPushButton` and `TugActionTooltip`, each keeping its own
 *       tokens.
