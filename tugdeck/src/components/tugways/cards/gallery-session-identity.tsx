/**
 * gallery-session-identity.tsx — the session-reference design surface.
 *
 * **SHIPPED.** The brief was `roadmap/session-reference-brief.md`: one identity
 * model, one resolver, one component family. Earlier rounds settled the two
 * registers (presence vs citation), the session atom's shape, the flat-text
 * citation, and the fork-lineage grammar. The seventh round settled the
 * CONTENT — what the surfaces actually say, and in what order — and
 * `roadmap/session-identity.md` carried all of it into the app. Every decision
 * below is now the shipped behavior, and `[D132]` is where it is durable; this
 * card is the bench the identity app-tests drive and the place the vocabulary is
 * discussed.
 *
 * Two questions from that round were deferred rather than answered, and they are
 * the surviving open items: whether the atom's sidecar segment should carry the
 * short id, and whether the Changes card's server-side `session_row_title` should
 * adopt the new grammar.
 *
 * What the seventh round decided, all of it shipped:
 *
 * - **The dot is the mark.** The chatbox icon retires from every surface that
 *   names a session; the pulsing phase dot replaces it — in the masthead, the
 *   rows, and the atom itself. One mark, everywhere, and the mark is ALIVE:
 *   it says what the session is doing, not just what kind of thing it is.
 * - **Red means errors.** The dot's idle form is the quiet white/inherit
 *   rung, and it is also the DOUBT form: a session whose live data is
 *   unreachable — closed, external, unbound — wears the idle dot, never a
 *   red one. Red is reserved for genuine failure: an errored turn, a dead
 *   wire under a live card.
 * - **The user's name leads.** A custom name is the user explicitly telling
 *   us what the session is called, and it cannot ride below a callsign we
 *   minted ourselves. The title grammar is `<custom-name> : <callsign>` when
 *   a name exists, bare `<callsign>` when not — in the masthead, the rows,
 *   the picker, and the atom, all four. This obliges the resolver to stop
 *   conflating: `SessionIdentity.title` (the `name ?? synopsis` merge)
 *   retires in favor of `customName` and `description` as separate fields.
 * - **Two levels under the title, not three.** The stack is title /
 *   description / activity. The standing-intent line (the old headline
 *   level) is cut as chrome ink — the description already says what the
 *   session is for, and two goal-shaped lines read as an echo. The intent
 *   survives in the history popover, where it heads its run of beats.
 * - **The word PULSE never prints.** It is the feature's internal name —
 *   stores, files, tests — and no longer a label, a legend, or a stand-in
 *   anywhere a user reads. The activity line always has something true to
 *   say instead (see the grammar below), so nothing needs a placeholder.
 * - **The activity line has a grammar.** At rest:
 *   `<turns> turns, <size>. Last updated: <last-updated>. Ready.` — with the
 *   stamp omitted at zero turns. During a turn it carries the live beat, and
 *   the sparkline beside it animates. A fresh or resumed session with no
 *   description yet shows its creation stamp on the description line, so the
 *   line is never blank and never a placeholder word.
 * - **The masthead slims its controls.** The width-control icon leaves the
 *   title row; the wave (telemetry) widget and close remain. Right-clicking
 *   the title copies the session ATOM — all flavors — and the telemetry
 *   popover displays the atom itself alongside the flat citation.
 * - **The atom is live.** It renders `[dot] <callsign>` or
 *   `[dot] <custom-name> : <callsign>`, and both the dot and the name track
 *   the running app — a rename mid-conversation repaints every mounted atom.
 *   So the atom is a COMPONENT with subscriptions, never a static string or
 *   a baked image. The liveness plumbing is designed in the atom section's
 *   prose: identity through `useSessionIdentity`, phase through a new
 *   session-keyed `useSessionPhase` that resolves card-bound sessions to
 *   their card's `codeSessionStore` and everything else to the idle dot.
 * - **The atom's ink is text color.** The theme's session color leaves the
 *   atom face: the run and the border paint from the ordinary text ink, and
 *   the DOT is the pill's only color channel — a colored pill around a
 *   colored dot was two tints saying one thing. Right-click on any atom
 *   offers Copy, exactly as the shipped chip already does.
 * - **The missing atom loses its slash.** With the icon gone, the
 *   unresolvable citation states its failure by shape alone: dashed border,
 *   muted ink, the still idle dot, inert. Same tooltip sentence as before.
 *
 * Retired by this round, recorded so they are not re-proposed: the chatbox
 * session icon (`MessageSquareText`) as the session mark; the three-level
 * description + intent + activity stack; the `PULSE` legend/stand-in as
 * user-facing ink; the four-line row (its metadata line folds into the
 * activity grammar); the masthead width control; red for anything but
 * errors; the session-colored pill paint (the dot is the atom's only color
 * now); the tape on picker rows (the picker reads at rest — the masthead
 * and the Lens keep theirs). Still standing from earlier rounds: no
 * per-session hashed tint; no monospace in session chrome; the citation
 * `<tag> (<shortid>)` as the only flat-text form; the fork-lineage grammar;
 * the three clipboard flavors (`text/html` stays struck).
 *
 * **What is real here and what is a drawing.** The shipped-component frame mounts
 * the real `TugSessionIdentity` at every state it renders — the line tier, both
 * chip sizes, a named chip, a narrow named chip, and the missing chip — and it is
 * load-bearing beyond illustration: `at0374` and `at0376` drive exactly those
 * mounts, so a claim proved there is a claim about what ships. The dot and the
 * tape are the real `TugProgressIndicator` and `TugSparkline` throughout. The
 * masthead mock and the `.gsi-*` title/atom prototypes remain as DRAWINGS of the
 * settled decisions, kept because a design surface that showed only the shipped
 * component could no longer show why it looks the way it does — but they are
 * drawings, and where one disagrees with the component the component is right.
 * Nothing in `gallery-session-identity.css` is a rule the app inherits.
 *
 * The masthead mock's title row draws dot + title + wave + close. That frame is
 * INCOMPLETE about the pane, and it taught the rollout plan the wrong control
 * inventory: the pane's own controls cluster sits beside the masthead and holds,
 * in order, the slot-stack badge, the `…` section menu, and the close X. Only the
 * width control left. See the caption on that section.

            The chatbox icon retires. Every surface that names a session
            leads with the pulsing phase dot — a mark that says what the
            session is <em>doing</em>, not just what kind of thing it is.
            Two rules govern it. <strong>White means idle, and idle is the
            default:</strong> a quiet session, a closed one, an external
            one, any session whose live data cannot be reached — all wear
            the still idle dot. <strong>Red means errors:</strong> an
            errored turn, a dead wire under a live card. Red never says
            &quot;idle&quot;, and doubt never says red.

          it updates when the agent rewrites it, on its own clock — and the

          <strong>How the liveness works.</strong> Identity is already live:
          the atom subscribes through <code>useSessionIdentity</code>, so a
          rename or a callsign reroll repaints it with no new machinery.
          Phase needs one new door: <code>useSessionPhase(sessionId)</code>,
          a session-keyed hook that resolves the dot&apos;s reading in
          precedence order — a card bound to the session answers from that
          card&apos;s <code>codeSessionStore</code> (via{" "}

          which the doubt rule makes correct rather than approximate. The
          hook&apos;s snapshot is the flattened phase <em>key</em>, so the
          per-card store&apos;s transcript-event churn wakes the
          subscription but re-renders the atom only when the key actually
          changes — the same discipline that keeps [P15]&apos;s identity
          path quiet. All of it enters React through{" "}
          <code>useSyncExternalStore</code> ([L02]), and the identity record
          itself still carries no phase field — liveness and identity remain
          two subscriptions with two keys that meet in the component.

            Unchanged in grammar: <code>{"<tag> (<short-id>)"}</code> is the
            only flat-text form, mono belongs to it alone, and the commit
            carries the human trailer plus the machine{" "}
            <code>Tug-Session-Id</code>. What changes is the chip the
            History card resolves it into — the dot-led atom, live like

            Copying an atom still writes the flavors Tug already speaks —
            the private sidecar, the plain-text citation, and the wire
            marker at submit; <code>text/html</code> stays struck. The
            change is on the paste side: what re-materializes in a Tug
            surface is the live dot-led component, so a pasted atom&apos;s
            dot starts reporting the session&apos;s phase the moment it
            lands.
