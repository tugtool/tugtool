/**
 * `ShellExchangeBlock` — the body of a `shell`-origin transcript turn ([P06]).
 *
 * Renders one `$`-route command/output exchange with the SAME chrome as every
 * other tool block ([D05]/[D111]): a `BlockChrome` header carrying the command
 * (the `$` prompt sigil + the command text, in the header — not a bespoke line
 * above the block, exactly as `BashToolBlock` puts its command in the header),
 * a right-aligned Add-to-context + Copy affordance cluster, and an embedded
 * `TerminalBlock` body for the combined output. The exchange's exit status and
 * duration are NOT drawn inside the block — they ride the Z1B end-state row
 * below it (`SessionZ1B participant="shell"`), the same place a Claude turn shows
 * its OK/Error badge + timing.
 *
 * The block carries no tool NAME in its header: the containing
 * `participant="shell"` transcript row already names it "Shell", so a repeated
 * name would be redundant (unlike a `Bash` block, which sits under the shared
 * "Code" assistant identity). The empty name collapses out of the header flow.
 *
 * While the exchange is in flight the header's lifecycle dot pulses (the
 * standard streaming signal) and there is no body; once it settles the body
 * mounts with the final output. Add-to-context ([P08]) is the only path into
 * Claude's context and appears once settled.
