/**
 * registerSessionCard — registers the "dev" card type with the card registry.
 *
 * Split out of `session-card.tsx` so that file stays a component-only React Fast
 * Refresh boundary: a `.tsx` exporting a registration function alongside its
 * components is "mixed" and non-accepting. This shim is `.tsx` because the
 * content factory JSX-renders `<SessionCardContent>`; it exports no component, so
 * it is transparent and does not itself need to be a boundary. `main.tsx`
 * imports `registerSessionCard` from here.

      // offers would have a floor no gesture can reach, and one that could not
      // reach slim would make the preset a lie on the card the diet was for.
      // `getStackSizePolicy` lifts the hosting pane's resize floor to this value
      // (or higher, if a wider card shares the pane), so the instrument readout
      // never clips. The height floor must fit the prompt entry (the fixed 200px
      // text area + its toolbar/indicator rows) AND leave the transcript its
      // minimum (`--session-transcript-min`), so the entry never crowds the
      // transcript out even at the smallest card size.

      // The height intentionally exceeds many laptop canvases; `addCard` clamps
      // height to 90% of the live canvas at creation, so on a smaller screen the
      // card opens at canvas * 0.9 instead of pushing past the viewport.
