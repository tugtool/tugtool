/**
 * `SessionHistoryView` — the History view-route's transcript-slot view
 * ([P01]/[P10]). On the `↺` route this replaces the transcript with the
 * card's own project git log rendered as a {@link TugHistoryList} — one
 * compact commit row per commit; submitting a question on this route sends
 * an on-record `/tugplug:history` turn (wired in the prompt entry).
 *
 * Data rides the shared `gitLogStore()` (`GIT_LOG` feed) — the card knows
 * its own `projectDir` from the binding, so the Lens-follow indirection is
 * gone. The store is an app-level singleton keyed by one requested root, so
 * `requestLog` fires only while THIS card's History view is the active slot
 * (`active`), and the render gates on `requestedRoot === projectDir` — two
 * cards viewing history of different projects at once is a known
 * single-store limitation, not a correctness hazard (each re-requests when
 * it regains focus). `GIT_HEAD` auto-refreshes the store after a commit.
 *
 * ## Paging
 *
 * History is read a page at a time and grows downward, the way a feed does.
 * Two things ask for the next page, both through the store's idempotent
 * `loadMore`:
 *
 *  - An `IntersectionObserver` watching a sentinel at the foot of the list,
 *    rooted on the scroller with a margin so the page is already in flight by
 *    the time the reader arrives at the bottom.
 *  - A top-up pass after every payload change, for the two cases an
 *    intersection cannot report: a page that did not fill the shade (so the
 *    sentinel never left the viewport and never re-fires), and a live filter
 *    whose matches are thin — there, the walk keeps going until the filter has
 *    enough rows to show or history runs out, so a match forty commits back is
 *    found rather than hidden behind a scroll the reader has no reason to make.
 *
 * Pages APPEND, so the scroller's content only ever grows at the bottom: every
 * row already on screen keeps its offset and the reader's place does not move.
 * That is also why the store holds the current payload through a refresh — the
 * one thing that would jump the list is having it emptied and rebuilt.
 *
 * ## Filtering
 *
 * The `TugFilterField` in the header strip trims the list to the commits whose
 * hash, message, details, or changed paths match ({@link commitFilterFields});
 * diffs are deliberately not searched. The query is this view's own React
 * state — the field and the list are in one component, so the module-store
 * adapter the Lens sections need does not apply here.
 *
 * Beside it, a `TugOptionGroup` AIMS the filter: Hash / Message / Detail /
 * Files, all on by default, each independently switchable
 * ({@link useCommitFilterScope} holds the reader's standing choice deck-wide).
 * A word common in file paths otherwise swamps the one commit whose subject
 * says it — narrowing is how a filter stays a way of finding one commit rather
 * than a way of listing many.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the log store enters React through `useSyncExternalStore`;
 * [L06] no appearance state in React; [L28] the store is the source of both
 * the log and its retry policy — this view subscribes and asks once per root,
 * and never re-derives "request again" from a phase the store publishes.
