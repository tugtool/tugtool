/**
 * file-view-card.tsx — the read-only viewer card body.
 *
 * One card renders every viewable file kind; the body branches on
 * `classifyFileKind` of its bound path. A future kind is a branch here, not a
 * new card: one registry entry, one seed shape (`{ path }`), one open-registry
 * story, one Lens filter.
 *
 * The card is strictly read-only. It keeps no dirty state, registers no save
 * plumbing, and publishes no `menuState.file` block — which is why the native
 * File menu's Save / Save As… / Revert to Saved validate disabled while a
 * viewer is frontmost, with no Swift-side change.
 *
 * The bytes come from tugcast's `/api/fs/blob`, which streams them, so the
 * card points an `<img>` at a URL rather than holding content in memory.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L02] the bound path is card state (the persisted bag), and the open
 *    registry is an external module store read through its own subscribe.
 *  - [L03] the open-registry registration lives in `useLayoutEffect` — an
 *    `open-file` for the same path can arrive before a passive effect commits.
 *  - [L06] load / error appearance rides `ImageBlock`'s
 *    `data-tugx-image-status` attribute, never React state for visuals.
 *  - [L20] the card styles its own frame only; `--tugx-image-*` belongs to
 *    `ImageBlock` and is never overridden here.
