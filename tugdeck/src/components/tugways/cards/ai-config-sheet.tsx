/**
 * ai-config-sheet.tsx — the one sheet that configures how the AI runs.
 *
 * Model, reasoning effort, and permission mode used to be three chips opening
 * three confirm-style pickers. They are one thought — "how should Claude run
 * for this session?" — and this sheet is that thought's single surface.
 *
 * **What is in it is not its own.** The body is {@link AiConfigEditor} — the
 * readout, the scope line, and the three channels — the same component the
 * Settings card's AI Model box shows. This module is the sheet *around* it: the
 * title, the doors, and the transaction.
 *
 * **It is a transaction.** Nothing reaches the wire until OK. That matters
 * here specifically because an effort change costs a claude respawn: browsing
 * options must never bounce the process, and holding the change until OK is
 * what lets a model + effort pick collapse into ONE respawn carrying both
 * flags ({@link computeAiConfigCommit}). Cancel and Escape send nothing at all.
 * The Settings panel drives the same channels with no transaction at all — it
 * writes deck defaults live, which cost nothing to change — so the transaction
 * is this sheet's disposition, not the controls'.
 *
 * **The executor is injected.** `onCommit` receives the ordered action array
 * and answers whether it applied — so the session card can re-check the
 * turn-idle guard and refuse (leaving the sheet open with its pending values
 * rather than closing on a commit that did nothing).
 *
 * **⌃⌘I is a toggle.** The chord that opens the sheet closes it again while it
 * is up, dismissing rather than committing — the same two-halved arrangement
 * the usage panel carries for ⌃⌘U: the opener answers the press when it
 * reaches the card, the mounted body answers it off the chain when it does
 * not. Re-presenting instead would swap the sheet for a fresh instance and
 * replay its entrance, which reads as a judder rather than as a command.
 *
 * **Choosing is free; committing is not.** Every control selects *live* into
 * the sheet's pending state — arrows audition a value and the readout and the
 * channel's own description follow at once — because inside a transaction a
 * selection has no side effect to defer ([P24]'s deferred form is for controls
 * whose selection acts). Only OK sends anything.
 *
 * Compositional component — composes `TugSheet`, `AiConfigEditor`, and
 * `TugPushButton`; its own CSS is the doors' column. Composed children keep
 * their own tokens [L20].
 *
 * Laws: [L02] store state is read through the store API; [L06] no React state
 *       for appearance (the pending SELECTION is dialog-local data, not
 *       appearance, so it is ordinary `useState`); [L07] the open-time baseline
 *       is read fresh from the store, never from a render closure; [L11] every
 *       control emits through the responder chain and none has a change
 *       callback; [L19]/[L20] composed `Tug*` components.
 *
