/**
 * gallery-motion-bench.tsx — a pinned population of one glyph, for the profiler.
 *
 * This card is an instrument, not a showcase. Every other gallery is edited for
 * what it teaches, which means the number of moving things on it changes
 * whenever someone improves the prose — and a profile taken against a moving
 * population cannot be compared to the one before it. Consolidating the
 * TugProgressIndicator gallery took its pulsing-dot count from 40 to 15 in a
 * single commit, which silently invalidated every number measured against it.
 *
 * So the population here is a constant. {@link BENCH_COUNT} dots, all
 * `running`, all one size, no drift, and nothing else on the card that moves —
 * no captions that transition, no pickers, no separators carrying a shimmer.
 * A/B one thing in the glyph, re-profile, and the delta means what it says.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     just app-debug                      # or leave the debug instance running
 *     tugutil host tell show-card -p component=gallery-motion-bench …
 *     just perf-resize-profile idle 6
 *
 * Read `applyKeyframeEffects` and `Style::TreeResolver::resolve` from the
 * verdict. Those are the frames that scale with the count of animations
 * WebKit is blending on the main thread; if the glyph's motion were
 * compositor-resident they would not move when {@link BENCH_COUNT} does.
 * The window must be raised — an occluded window throttles to a flat 0%.
