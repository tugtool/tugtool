/**
 * Governance test for `tide-tool-visibility-policy.ts` — pins the two
 * invariants that catch *real* mistakes (the ones code review can
 * miss), and the canonical v2.1.148 tool-set coverage that protects
 * against drift from a future Claude Code release.
 *
 * Per [D101], `TOOL_VISIBILITY_POLICY` is the single editable source
 * of truth for the `hidden` and `default-intent` buckets; bespoke is
 * implicit (registry presence).
 *
 *  (c) Every `default-intent` entry's rationale contains both
 *      `"Awaiting"` and a `#step-` substring. This is the *only*
 *      mechanism preventing `default-intent` from becoming a
 *      forever-bucket — without it, a vague rationale lets a tool
 *      sit in the default bucket indefinitely with no planned
 *      bespoke wrapper. The test enforces the social contract.
 *  (d) Every name in `V2_1_148_CANONICAL_TOOL_NAMES` (hardcoded here)
 *      is covered by either the bespoke side (`BESPOKE_TOOL_NAMES`)
 *      or the policy. A new built-in tool added in a future Claude
 *      Code release fails CI until it is explicitly classified —
 *      this is the test most aligned with the plan's goal of "fails
 *      CI when an unclassified tool appears."
 *
 * # Cut on purpose
 *
 * Two checks the original spec called for were dropped because they
 * mostly verify "TypeScript compiled" rather than catching a real
 * failure mode that code review wouldn't:
 *
 *  - (a) "Every entry parses" — the entry shape is already enforced
 *    by the `ToolVisibilityEntry` interface; the lowercase / ISO-date
 *    string checks are weak and the duplicate-name guard is marginal
 *    for an array of ~20 entries.
 *  - (b) "No double-classification" — realistic in principle, but
 *    obvious in code review and very rare in practice. The
 *    `hidden` / `default-intent` split is mutually exclusive by the
 *    enum; a bespoke-and-policy overlap would be visible at glance.
 *
 * The two cuts are about test-suite signal-to-noise, not coverage
 * theatre. Adding (a) or (b) back when a concrete bug is missed by
 * review is fine — until then, the tests below are the ones that
 * pay for their maintenance cost.

/**
 * Hardcoded snapshot of the v2.1.148 built-in tool registry, extracted
 * from `capabilities/2.1.148/system-metadata.jsonl`. Names match the
 * `system_metadata.tools` array exactly — `Task` is the canonical
 * upstream name (the dispatch aliases it to `agent` internally).
 *
 * Coverage check (d) asserts every name here is either bespoke
 * (in `BESPOKE_TOOL_NAMES`) or policy-classified. A new tool added
 * in a future Claude Code release will fail this test until it is
 * explicitly classified — which is the point: forces the person
 * bumping the catalog to also decide the new tool's bucket.
 *
 * **Out of scope.** The `mcp__*` namespace is variable, user-installed,
 * and explicitly deferred per the project's MCP non-goal policy
 * (`roadmap/tide-assistant-rendering.md` §Open Questions). It is not
 * listed here.
