/**
 * use-landing-receipts — the commit landing as transcript ink ([P07]).
 *
 * One subscription over the app-level changeset verb store per Session card:
 * when a `changeset_commit` round-trip for this card's entry resolves, append
 * the server-formatted summary (S02) as a `/commit` row through the
 * shell-exchange ink mechanism ([D111] — the row records what the user did,
 * never what Claude knows; it is not session context). The server has already
 * persisted the same row to the shell ledger, so this live append is the
 * initiating client's copy; other decks pick it up on their next restore, and
 * the row survives reload + cold boot from the ledger.
 *
 * The summary string is the single source ([P07]): this hook ingests it
 * verbatim, and the receipt blocks parse the identical string live and on
 * restore, so the two rows are byte-identical.
 *
 * Join and release ride the same mechanism ([P06]). Each has one terminal edge
 * to hang a row off — join's `done`, release's `done` — and each appends only
 * when the server actually sent a summary, so a landing this card merely
 * watched leaves no ink here.
 *
 * Laws: [L22] store→store wiring observes the verb store's own subscription
 * directly (no useSyncExternalStore → useEffect round-trip).
