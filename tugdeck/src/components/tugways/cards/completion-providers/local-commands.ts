/**
 * local-commands.ts — slash-completion provider for the local-command
 * registry, plus a small provider-merge helper.
 *
 * The dev card's `/` completion comes from claude (skills, agents,
 * claude's own slash commands) via
 * `SessionMetadataStore.getCommandCompletionProvider()`. Locally-handled
 * commands ([D23], `lib/slash-commands.ts`) are *not* claude's, so they
 * are not in that set — the dev card merges them in at its composition
 * layer (where the `/` provider is already assembled and wrapped with
 * `wrapPositionZero`). Doing the merge here, not inside
 * `SessionMetadataStore`, keeps the store generic and keeps local
 * commands out of other hosts' popups (e.g. the gallery, which calls the
 * store provider directly).
 *
 * Pure: depends only on the shared text-engine types and the registry.

 *
 * - **Dedup precedence** decides which item *survives* when a name appears in
 *   more than one provider: first-wins, so listing the local provider first
 *   means a name claude also reports resolves to the local (graphical) entry.
 * - **Display order** is by match quality (descending {@link scoreMatch}
 *   score), with alphabetical as the tiebreak — so `/permi` ranks
 *   `permissions` (a prefix hit) above `fewer-permission-prompts` (a
 *   word-boundary hit) instead of letting the alphabet decide. The score is
 *   recomputed here from each surviving item's label against the live query;
 *   the providers don't thread a score through the `CompletionItem` shape, and
 *   re-scoring a ≤ 50-item list per keystroke is free. For an empty query
 *   `scoreMatch` returns no score, so every item ties and the ordering falls
 *   back to purely alphabetical — the previous behavior, preserved.
 *
 * Synchronous only — command providers don't carry the async `subscribe` hook
 * that file completion uses.
