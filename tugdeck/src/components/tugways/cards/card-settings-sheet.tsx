/**
 * card-settings-sheet.tsx — a card's own view settings, as a pane-modal
 * sheet.
 *
 * One sheet, three bodies, one per kind of document a card can be showing.
 * The gear in the pane's title bar is a single command ([L30] —
 * `SHOW_CARD_SETTINGS`), and the card that handles it is the only thing that
 * knows what kind it is, so the kind arrives here as an argument rather than
 * being sniffed.
 *
 * A sheet rather than a popover because the trigger is a title-bar button
 * whose command is dispatched through the chain: the press is a command, not
 * an anchor, and the card already presents its save, conflict, and revert
 * decisions as sheets — this joins that family.
 *
 * The controls components are the same ones the Settings card's deck-wide
 * defaults panels render, so a card's own settings and the defaults they came
 * from cannot look like two different instruments.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] every body holds a live subscription through its
 * `useCardSettings` hook, so a change repaints the open sheet;
 * [L19]/[use-tug-components] composes `TugSheet`'s presenter and the real
 * shared controls rather than restating either.
 *
