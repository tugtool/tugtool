/**
 * `AskUserQuestionToolBlock` — Layer-2 wrapper for Claude Code's
 * `AskUserQuestion` tool.
 *
 * The tool has two surfaces in the transcript, and this ONE block owns
 * both — IN PLACE, at the tool_use position. A single `BlockChrome`
 * stays mounted across the call's lifecycle ([L26]); only its body
 * morphs, so the option/button chrome simply disappears on answer with
 * no width, treatment, or position shift ([D13]):
 *
 *   1. **Asking state (live question).** When a `control_request_forward`
 *      for this call's `tool_use_id` is the session's `pendingQuestion`
 *      (and `status === "streaming"`), the block fills its chrome body
 *      with the live `QuestionWizard` (`dev-question-dialog.tsx`) — the
 *      radio / check prompt that submits the user's choices back to
 *      Claude. The chrome is `forceExpanded` so a blocking question can't
 *      be folded away ([P07]). Before the forward arrives (and the user
 *      hasn't answered), the block renders `null`.
 *
 *   2. **Answered / ready state.** The user answers, `pendingQuestion`
 *      clears, and the SAME chrome swaps its body to the durable
 *      artifact: a clean, numbered Q&A list. The just-submitted answers
 *      are captured locally (`onResolve` → `submitted`) so the summary
 *      paints immediately, covering the window between `pendingQuestion`
 *      clearing and the tool_result landing — no empty-answer flash, no
 *      remount.
 *
 * Composition (Spec S03, [#bk-conformance]):
 *  - `BlockChrome` owns the frame: the tool name + a short args
 *    summary (the question count).
 *  - **Body — ready state:** a numbered list of `Q → A` pairs. The
 *    question text reads as the prompt, the chosen label (or
 *    comma-separated labels for multi-select) reads as the response.
 *    No `JsonTreeBlock`, no raw schema. When no answer is recorded
 *    yet, the row reads "(no answer)" in muted prose — the same
 *    fallback the spoken summary uses.
 *  - **Body — error state:** the chrome's error band carries the
 *    failure text; the body drops.
 *
 * Wire shape:
 *  - `input.questions[]` — same `ParsedQuestion`-ish shape the
 *    `QuestionDialog` parses. Reused via {@link parseQuestions} so
 *    drift surfaces in both surfaces consistently.
 *  - The chosen answers arrive on the *completed* `tool_use_structured`
 *    (or merged back into `input.answers` per tugcode's
 *    `formatQuestionAnswer`) as `{ answers: Record<string, string> }`,
 *    keyed by question text, value is the chosen label(s). Defensive
 *    narrowing here means we read either surface (`structuredResult` or
 *    `input.answers`) so the wrapper renders correctly across the
 *    catalog's variations.
 *
 * Registration: `dev-assistant-renderer-dispatch.ts` imports this
 * module and calls `registerToolBlock("askuserquestion", …)`
 * alongside the other wrappers. The registry's lowercased keys
 * absorb wire-shape casing variants (`AskUserQuestion` /
 * `askuserquestion`) automatically.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L06] no React state for appearance; chrome owns DOM
 *    attributes; the body composition is pure props derived via
 *    `useMemo`.
 *  - [L19] file pair (`.tsx` + `.css`), exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot="ask-user-question-tool-block"` (delegated via the
 *    chrome's `rootSlot`).
 *  - [L20] reuses the chrome's `--tugx-block-*`; the small Q&A
 *    list owns `--tugx-askquestion-*` (declared in the sibling
 *    `.css`). No cross-component token poaching.
 *
 * Decisions:
 *  - [D05] two-layer hybrid — chrome owns frame, body owns the
 *    rendering. The body here is component-local because the Q&A
 *    summary surface is wrapper-specific (not a reusable body kind
 *    like `JsonTreeBlock`).
 *  - [D11] `AskUserQuestion` is promoted out of the `DefaultToolBlock`
 *    fallback now that the wrapper is bespoke; the unknown-tool
 *    caution disappears automatically.
