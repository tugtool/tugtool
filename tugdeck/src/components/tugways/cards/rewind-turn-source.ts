 * that opened with a real user submission AND carries the `promptUuid` anchor
 * ([#step-7-1]). Wake turns (no user message) and pre-anchor turns (older
 * sessions) are skipped — they cannot be `session_rewind` targets.
 *
 * This is NOT a `SessionPickerSheet` data source ([D05]): that lists *distinct
 * sessions* for `/resume`; this lists *turns within the current session*. The
 * projection is pure (no diff-stat) — the per-row diff-stat is fetched lazily
 * by the cell from the store snapshot's `rewindPreviews`, keyed by
 * `promptUuid` (the N+1-avoiding lazy/cached discipline lives in the sheet).
