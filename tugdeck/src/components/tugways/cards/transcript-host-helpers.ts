/**
 * Transcript-host helpers — value exports split out of
 * `session-card-transcript.tsx` so that file stays a component-only React Fast
 * Refresh boundary. A `.tsx` exporting hooks/functions alongside its
 * `SessionTranscriptHost` component is "mixed" and non-accepting, so editing it
 * (or anything it transitively imports) full-reloads. This module owns the
 * model-name hook, the timestamp formatter, and the per-cell context-menu
 * wiring; `session-card-transcript.tsx` and the copy-wiring gallery import them.
 *
 * **Laws:** [L02] — `useSessionModelName` reads the model through
 * `useSyncExternalStore` over `SessionMetadataStore` only. [L07] — the
 * cell-menu copy/select-all handlers sample the body element live from a ref
 * and close over the captured value, so a re-render during the menu blink
 * can't race the deferred operation. [L11] — the menu dispatches COPY /
 * SELECT_ALL via `useResponder` + targeted control dispatch, the canonical
 * tugway control shape.
