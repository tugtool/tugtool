/**
 * Transient-notice projection — the pure half of the Session card's
 * non-blocking interruption surface.
 *
 * Self-healing model interruptions (API retries, transport blips, replay
 * dwell, unknown events, and — once the bridge forwards them — model-refusal
 * fallback and output truncation) are *notifications*, not breakage. They must
 * never lock the card the way the `error` banner does. This module turns a
 * `CodeSessionSnapshot` into the set of bulletins that should be showing
 * ({@link projectNotices}), and diffs two such sets into the imperative
 * post/dismiss actions a controller applies to the pane bulletin API
 * ({@link reconcileNotices}).
 *
 * Both functions are pure and DOM-free so the transition logic is unit-tested
 * without a store or a mounted toaster. The controller that observes the store
 * and applies the actions lives in `transient-notice-controller.tsx`; it never
 * routes this state through React render ([L22]).
