/**
 * gallery-cycle-demo.tsx — exercises the keyboard-focus-cycling mode primitive
 * (`useCycleMode`) on a minimal surface, decoupled from the dev card's stateful
 * picker/connected machinery.
 *
 * The card stands in for a text-first card: a **resting** focusable (the
 * "editor" stand-in, in the base mode) plus three **cycle stops** wrapped in the
 * hook's `CycleScope` (so they register into this card's cycle mode, not the
 * base mode). ⌥⇥ (the `CYCLE_FOCUS_MODE` action, routed to this card's
 * `card-content` responder) toggles cycling:
 *
 *   - ON  → the mode is pushed (trapped); the key view seeds on the commit-home
 *     (the lowest-`focusOrder` cycle stop) and Tab wraps within the stops;
 *   - OFF → the mode pops and the key view returns to the resting focusable.
 *
 * This is the permanent showcase + app-test surface for the mechanism
 * ([#step-cycle-mechanism]); the real consumer (the dev card, with per-state
 * default focus + roles) lands in [#step-cycle-devcard]. Escape / Return / Space
 * mode-key semantics land in [#step-cycle-keys].
 *
 * Laws: [L02] cycling is engine-derived (in the hook); [L06] appearance is the
 *       engine ring via CSS, no React state; [L19] gallery-card authoring.
