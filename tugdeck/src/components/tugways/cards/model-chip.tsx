/**
 * `ModelChip` — Z4B display-only model indicator.
 *
 * Shows the session's active model (`system_metadata.model`) as a two-line
 * `TugBadge` (`label-top` / `size="sm"` / `role="agent"`) carrying a `MODEL`
 * caption over the formatted label (`claude-opus-4-8[1m]` → `Opus 4.8 · 1M`).
 *
 * Display-only per [D13] — no click, no menu. The model is changed via the
 * `/model` slash command ([#step-2b]); the synthetic `model_change`
 * confirmation lands in the transcript per [D09], so this chip does no banner
 * work and owns no sheet. It is the model sibling of `DevSessionIdBadge` and
 * the project badge — the same plain `TugBadge` shape.
 *
 * **Never hides on missing data.** When the session has not reported a model
 * (`model === null`), the chip stays mounted and escalates to `caution` with a
 * `?` value and an alert icon — the same "surface the gap, don't swallow it"
 * treatment the Claude Code version chip uses for drift
 * ([dev-route-indicator-badge.tsx]). An absent model is information worth
 * seeing, not a reason to vanish.
 *
 * Data source ([L02] — external state enters React through
 * `useSyncExternalStore` only): the live `model` from
 * `SessionMetadataStore`, updated by each `system_metadata` event. The chip is
 * NOT width-stabilized — it reflows when the model changes, accepted per [R01].
 *
 * Compositional component — composes `TugBadge` and adds no styling, so it is
 * `.tsx`-only per the component-authoring "Compositional Component" rule; the
 * composed `TugBadge` keeps its own tokens [L20].
 *
 * Laws: [L02] store subscription, [L06] appearance via CSS/DOM, [L19] authoring
 * Decisions: [D01] Z4B chrome anchor, [D04] SessionMetadataStore hub,
 *            [D09] model-confirm in transcript, [D13] Z4B indicator-only
 *
