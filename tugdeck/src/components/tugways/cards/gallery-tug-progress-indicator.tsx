/**
 * gallery-tug-progress-indicator.tsx — TugProgressIndicator showcase.
 *
 * Replaces three earlier galleries (gallery-progress, gallery-tug-
 * state-indicator, gallery-tug-thinking-indicator) — the unified
 * indicator subsumes all three predecessors.
 *
 * Layout:
 *  - Variants  — six glyphs in a wrapping card grid
 *  - pulsing-dot — the whole bench for the breathing dot in one section: the
 *                size ladder under a live state picker, the Lens-row
 *                destination, and the two knobs still worth benching.
 *                The ladder and the picker are one grid because they were
 *                always one question — every size the app asks for, crossing
 *                to whatever state you name. A still frame cannot show a
 *                crossing, and a size ladder frozen in `running` cannot show
 *                the settled poses most of these sizes spend their life in.
 *  - Roles     — eight role tones in a wrapping card grid (ring variant)
 *  - States    — a 4 × 5 matrix (variant rows × state columns)
 *  - Determinate — a 3 × 5 matrix (variant rows × value columns)
 *  - Value readout — showValue percentage on bar / ring / pie + labeled bar
 *  - Phase     — phase picker + live indicator using phaseLabels/phaseVisual
 *  - Layout    — glyphPosition picker + labelAlign="center" demo with
 *                width-stabilize so phase changes don't shift layout

 * and sinks over the remaining 1400ms. The comparison that carries the
 * decision is against 0.5 — the symmetric breath this variant shipped with
 * first, the one that reads as a mechanism cycling rather than something
 * alive. Cuts between the two only interpolate between those two readings, and
 * a bench of them asks the eye to grade a continuum instead of judging a
 * choice. Everything else about the envelope follows from the turn: the ring's
 * ignition sits 3% of the cycle ahead of it, at whatever radius the dot's edge
 * measures there.
 *
 * **Stroke** is where the pulse's stroke arrives by the end of its travel;
 * every cell is born at the same 1px hairline. ×1 is a pulse that barely opens
 * at all, leaving as thin as the ring it settles into, and it is the reading
 * the shipped ×1.6 was chosen against. Expect a coarse difference rather than
 * a fine one — borders resolve to device pixels, so the knob is continuous and
 * the screen is not, which is also why the intermediate weights were never
 * distinguishable here.

            cycle, ~10.8° BTDC — flush with the dot's edge, so it is already
            moving when the dot turns over it. It then widens to the glyph box
            and fades across the exhale. Its stroke is born a 1px hairline and
            holds there through most of the travel before opening to the full
            pulse weight — sharp for long enough to be read as sharp, soft by

            full-box static ring, same hairline — picking up the new motion and
            nothing else, so a settled dot in a Z2 cell or a tool-call header
            paints the pixels it always painted. From 28px up it is the Lens
            figure, where the extra size buys a 0.6 dot ratio, a ring held
            inside the box, and the PRESENCE ladder: running owns the whole box,
            paused and aborted draw in to 0.7, stopped and completed recede to
            0.5. The box itself never changes, so nothing reflows — only the
            figure inside it does. Two numbers move on the way down: the ring's
            reach, let out past the box to 1.75× because 2.5px of radius reads
            as a twitch rather than a pulse, and the breath's depth, which
            narrows to a 0.7 trough because a 6px dot cannot spend half its
            diameter every cycle. The two middle rungs are here to show that the

            **Every state change is a transition, never a cut.** A real one
            lands on a frame nobody chose — a tool call finishes mid-breath,
            with a ring halfway through its travel — and the glyph has to arrive
            without tearing. A lit pulse always finishes: it was shed, it is
            travelling outward under its own momentum, and the work ending is no
            business of its, so the emitter is released on the pulse's clock
            rather than the state's. A ring that was never lit is simply never
            lit. The dot is caught where it stands — its live scale is pinned,
            the loop dropped against that pin so the removal changes nothing,
            and a transition carries it from there. Going back into running is
            the same idea inverted: the breath starts at the phase whose pose the
            dot already holds, and picks it up mid-stride.
