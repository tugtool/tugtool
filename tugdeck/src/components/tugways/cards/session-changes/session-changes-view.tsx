/**
 * `SessionChangesView` — the read-only changes glance ([P02]). Rides the
 * bottom-anchored passive TugSheet `shade` over the live transcript and shows
 * the card's changed files: the session's attributed files plus the project's
 * unattributed files, per-file inline diffs, and the non-repo git-init
 * affordance. It answers "what's changed?" — glanceable, dismiss-and-forget.
 *
 * The sheet is passive ([P17]): the composer below keeps focus (⌃⌘C is the
 * toggle; landing a commit lives in the composer's commit mode + Z5), so
 * the view carries no Done button, no header X, and seeds no key view. The
 * file rows are `TugChangesList` ([P01]); the header keeps only its fold-all
 * cue + whole-diff pop-out, and the git-init affordance sits in the body.
 *
 * The list IS this session's diff — every row expands into its own hunks — so
 * the view mounts no second whole-session document above it. The repo-wide
 * view is a different surface entirely: the Project Diff card (`/diff`).
 *
 * Below the file rows sits the `SessionChangesDashLane` — the project's dashes
 * in their own grammar, with their own fold. The header's fold-all cue and
 * combined pop-out keep acting on the head entries only; the lane owns its
 * own folding, because a dash is a different species from a claimed file.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the controller + git-init verb store enter React through
 * `useSyncExternalStore`; [L06] no appearance state in React (status tones and
 * hover affordances paint via CSS); [L26] per-file diff bodies collapse by
 * unmount inside `TugChangesList`'s rows.
