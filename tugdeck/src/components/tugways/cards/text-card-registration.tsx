/**
 * Text card registration — split from `text-card.tsx` so the card body
 * stays a component-only Fast-Refresh boundary (mirrors the
 * `dev-card.tsx` / `dev-card-registration.tsx` split).
 *
 * `engineKind: "em"` — the card content owns its own focus lifecycle:
 * activation routes to the body's `onCardActivated` (which lands focus
 * on the CM6 editing surface) instead of the generic default-focus
 * walk.
 *
 * No `confirmClose`: under live autosave there is nothing unsaved to
 * lose — closing a Text card is always safe.
