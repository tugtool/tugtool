/**
 * Pure derivation of the Dev card's `<TugPaneBanner>` spec from the
 * `CodeSessionSnapshot` plus a small UI-local context (the dismissed
 * error timestamp). The body renders **one** banner whose props
 * are computed by mapping the spec's discriminated kind to
 * `TugPaneBanner` props — the precedence chain in this helper is the
 * single source of truth for "which banner surface is showing".
 *
 * Precedence (highest first):
 *
 *   1. **error** — `lastError` is set, the cause is banner-routable
 *      (i.e. not `resume_failed`), and the error has not been
 *      user-dismissed by `at` timestamp.
 *   2. **transport** — `transportState !== "online"`. Covers
 *      idle-offline (and, defensively, restoring; the gate already
 *      routes restoring to a backdrop, so this branch is a no-op
 *      in production).
 *   3. **replay-timeout** — the most recent replay completed with a
 *      `replay_timeout` outcome and the dwell window (1.5s) is still
 *      active. Surfaces the failure copy briefly before dismissing.
 *   4. **none** — no banner.
 *
 * **Retired.** This helper once carried a
 * `replay-loading` kind — a "Loading session…" strip shown during the
 * cold-boot preflight beat and the `phase === "replaying"` window. It
 * is gone: the restore-reveal coordination of D.2.A routes the whole
 * cold-restore window to the centered `DevRestoring` placeholder and
 * holds `DevCardBody` unmounted until `replay_complete`, so a
 * replay-window banner had no surface to mount on and nothing left to
 * communicate. The placeholder, delay-gated, is the single loading
 * affordance. The `error` / `transport` / `replay-timeout` kinds stay
 * — those are genuine outcomes shown on the mounted body after the
 * restore resolves.
 *
 * Why a separate module: the helper is pure, takes a snapshot, and
 * returns a discriminated union. Testing it in isolation
 * (`dev-card-banner-spec.test.ts`) verifies the precedence chain
 * branch-by-branch without spinning up a real card render. The body
 * does the spec → `TugPaneBanner` props mapping inline since that's
 * a presentational concern best read alongside the JSX that consumes
 * it.
