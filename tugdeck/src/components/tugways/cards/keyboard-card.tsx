/**
 * keyboard-card.tsx — Keyboard Shortcuts card (app-level singleton).
 *
 * The keymap configurator: every command Tug can perform, what it is bound to,
 * and a way to change the ones that are the user's to change. The surface
 * itself is {@link SettingsKeymapBody}; this card is its host.
 *
 * It is a card rather than a section of Settings because of what it is made
 * of. The configurator is a `TugListView`, which unmounts rows outside its
 * scrollport and drives `SmartScroll` — it needs a container whose height is
 * definite, and it gets that only from a pane. The Settings card grows to its
 * content and lets the pane scroll it, which is the opposite shape. So the
 * card root fills the pane (`height: 100%; min-height: 0`) and
 * `.settings-keymap`'s existing chain resolves against it unchanged.
 *
 * Shown via the app menu's Keyboard Shortcuts… item, which routes through
 * `DeckManager.showSingletonCard("keyboard")` — at most one exists at a time.
 *
 * Laws: layout lives in keyboard-card.css [L06].
 *
 * @module components/tugways/cards/keyboard-card
