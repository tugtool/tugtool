/**
 * dash-picker-sheet.tsx — bare `/dash-bind`'s picker, when the project holds
 * more than one dash.
 *
 * Picking which dash to work on is a UI-concept act with no turn and no durable
 * consequence, exactly like the `bind_dash` it performs ([P01]) — so it is a
 * sheet on the card's existing host and never transcript ink. A disposable
 * choice does not belong permanently in the record.
 *
 * The list owns its cursor: `TugListView` in `singleSelect` mode with
 * `commitOnEnter="act"` gives arrow motion, Return, and click for free ([L19]),
 * and the card's own dash seeds the selection so Return with no arrow presses
 * is a no-op rebind rather than a surprise. Nothing here mirrors the selection
 * into React state.
 *
 * The sheet resolves with no value. The bind's outcome arrives through the
 * `bind_dash_ok` broadcast and the card-scoped bind-error store, both of which
 * outlive the sheet — which is why dismissing it mid-bind is harmless.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance is CSS on data attributes; [L19] composes
 * `TugListView` / `TugListRow` rather than hand-rolling list focus; [L20]
 * composed children keep their own tokens.
 *
