/**
 * The attached-filter binding — the pairing of a `TugFilterField` with the
 * `TugListView` it trims, authored once and read from both ends.
 *
 * ## Why a binding rather than two wires
 *
 * The attached-list contract ([P08], `tuglaws/focus-language.md`) is
 * bidirectional, and each direction needs the other participant:
 *
 *  - **field → list.** The caret is in the field; ↑/↓ drive the list's cursor
 *    and never leave the field. The field needs the list's handle.
 *  - **list → field.** The ring is on the list; a printable character is a
 *    request to filter, so it is SHADOWED into the field. The list needs to
 *    write the field's query.
 *
 * Authored as two independent props those halves can drift: a site that wires
 * one and forgets the other is a surface where the pair behaves like a compound
 * control going down and like two strangers going up, and nothing fails loudly.
 * So the relationship is ONE object, created by {@link useAttachedFilter} and
 * handed to both participants. Each end publishes itself into it on mount and
 * reads the other end at keystroke time — never at render time, because either
 * may mount after the other (a list behind a loading state, a collapsed Lens
 * section whose body is not in the tree yet).
 *
 * ## Type-select: the list keeps the keyboard
 *
 * The upward direction is **type-select**, the Finder gesture — typing at a
 * list narrows it *without the list giving up the keyboard*. The field shows
 * what was typed; it does not receive it. That distinction is the whole
 * feature: the reason to type is to find a row and act on it, so `Return` must
 * still reach the list's cursored row and ↑/↓ must still move it. A design that
 * granted the caret to the field instead — which this contract briefly did —
 * narrows correctly and then strands the user, because the row they were
 * hunting is now behind a Tab.
 *
 * So the field half is a set of MUTATORS, not a focus target. The list calls
 * {@link AttachedFilterField.appendChar} and the field writes its own input
 * value and fires its delegate's change notification — the same path a real
 * keystroke in the field takes, so there is still exactly one value authority
 * (the `<input>`'s DOM value) and one filtering path. The field is never
 * focused by a forward, and nothing is mirrored or duplicated: what it shows IS
 * the query.
