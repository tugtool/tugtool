/**
 * useKeyCardId / useIsKeyCard -- React hooks over the derived key-card
 * value on the responder chain manager.
 *
 * "Key card" is the nearest ancestor of `kind: "card"` reached by
 * walking up `parentId` from the current first responder. It is
 * derived, not stored — see `roadmap/key-card.md` Phase 1.
 *
 * Both hooks subscribe to the manager via `useSyncExternalStore` ([L02]).
 * `manager.subscribe` already fires on every chain change that could
 * affect the derived value (register, unregister, first-responder
 * change), so the snapshot stays correct without a separate observer
 * channel. The chain's `observeKeyResponder` API exists for non-React
 * consumers; React code should prefer these hooks.
 *
 * Both hooks are tolerant of being rendered outside a
 * `<ResponderChainProvider>` — they return null / false respectively,
 * matching the existing tolerant-hook convention (see
 * `useOptionalResponder`). This keeps card chrome render code uniform
 * across in-provider and standalone test mounts.
