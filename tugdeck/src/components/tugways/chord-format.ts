 * Tug identifies a chord by `KeyboardEvent.code` plus the exact state of the
 * four modifier flags ([P09]). AppKit identifies one by an `NSMenuItem`
 * key-equivalent *character* plus a modifier mask. They are different
 * alphabets — `"ArrowUp"` is `NSUpArrowFunctionKey`, `"Escape"` is `\u{1b}`,
 * and shifted punctuation is genuinely ambiguous — and every place that
 * spells one of them by hand is a place the two can drift apart.
 *
 * So all four jobs live here: the lookup identity a chord index is keyed by,
 * the match rule the key pipeline runs, the conversion the host consumes, and
 * the display string every surface renders. A chord that reads one way in the
 * menu bar, another in the keymap pane, and fires on a third is the failure
 * this module exists to make impossible.
