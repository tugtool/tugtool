/**
 * action-vocabulary.ts — the central registry of action names that
 * flow through the responder chain.
 *
 * Every action dispatched via `manager.sendToFirstResponder`, registered via
 * `useResponder`'s actions map, or bound in `keybinding-map.ts` must
 * reference a name from `TUG_ACTIONS` below. The `TugAction` union
 * is derived from `TUG_ACTIONS` via `as const`, so adding a new
 * action is one edit (the constants object) and the union, the
 * compile-time checks, and the call sites pick it up automatically.
 *
 * ## The constants idiom
 *
 * `TUG_ACTIONS` is the single source of truth. Each key is the
 * canonical `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constant name; each value is the
 * wire-format string dispatched on the chain. `TugAction` is
 * `typeof TUG_ACTIONS[keyof typeof TUG_ACTIONS] | Extra`, so the
 * union literally cannot drift from the constants. Call sites
 * always reference the constant, never a raw string literal:
 *
 * ```ts
 * controlDispatch.dispatch({ action: TUG_ACTIONS.CUT, phase: "discrete" });
 *
 * useResponder({
 *   id: cardId,
 *   actions: {
 *     [TUG_ACTIONS.CLOSE]: (_e: ActionEvent) => handleClose(),
 *   },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * See `tuglaws/action-naming.md` for the naming convention, the
 * three-way classification (chain action / control frame / both),
 * and the enforcement policy.
 *
 * ## Vocabulary granularity decision (middle ground)
 *
 * One action per semantic, rich payloads carried on
 * `ActionEvent.value`. E.g. a single `set-value` action covers
 * sliders, value-inputs, and numeric fields, with the payload's
 * type documented alongside the constant in this file. This keeps
 * the name-level type union tight without exploding it into
 * per-control variants.
 *
 * Payload conventions are documented per-action below. Handlers
 * should narrow `event.value` defensively — TypeScript cannot
 * express "this value is a number *only* when action is set-value"
 * without a discriminated union, which would force all callers to
 * construct richly-typed ActionEvent objects at every dispatch
 * site. The current tradeoff is: tight action *names*, loose
 * `value` shape, with conventions documented here and enforced by
 * handler authors.
 *
 * Laws: [L11] controls emit actions; responders handle actions.
 *
 * When adding a new action:
 *   1. Pick a name following the `<verb>-<object>[-<modifier>]`
 *      rule from `tuglaws/action-naming.md`.
 *   2. Classify it: chain action, control frame, or both.
 *   3. For chain-action / both categories: add one entry to
 *      `TUG_ACTIONS` (or `TUG_GALLERY_ACTIONS`) in the appropriate
 *      section below, with an adjacent payload comment.
 *   4. Document the expected payload shape on `ActionEvent.value`.
 *   5. Document `ActionEvent.sender` expectations if multiple
 *      controls of the same kind can emit this action.
 *   6. Compile — the derived `TugAction` union picks up the new
 *      member automatically, so every call site referencing
 *      `TUG_ACTIONS.<NEW>` type-checks without any other edit.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * TUG_ACTIONS — production action constants
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Values are kebab-case wire strings per `tuglaws/action-naming.md`.
 * Keys are the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE canonical constant names every

export const TUG_ACTIONS = {
  // ---- Clipboard ----
  //
  // NAMESPACE BOUNDARY: These kebab-case strings are chain-dispatch
  // names, NOT browser execCommand names. Handlers that call
  // document.execCommand must use the browser's own camelCase
  // vocabulary ("selectAll", "insertText", "delete", etc.).
  // See tuglaws/action-naming.md § "Action Names vs. Browser
  // Command Names" for the full rule.
  //
  // CUT:         payload — none. The first responder cuts its current
  //              selection. Handlers typically return a continuation for
  //              two-phase activation (copy to clipboard synchronously,
  //              delete the selection after the menu blink).
  // COPY:        payload — none. The first responder copies its current
  //              selection. No continuation expected.
  // COPY_AS_PLAIN_TEXT: payload — none. Like COPY, but the selection's
  //              Markdown source is stripped to plain text (headings,
  //              emphasis, code, links → their text content) before it
  //              lands on the clipboard. Plain-text only; no atom sidecar.
  //              Bound to ⌥⇧⌘C.
  // PASTE:       payload — none. The first responder pastes clipboard
  //              content. Handlers typically return a continuation so the
  //              paste happens after any menu activation animation.
  // PASTE_AS_QUOTE:      payload — none. Like PASTE, but the clipboard's
  //              plain text is rewritten as a Markdown blockquote (every
  //              line prefixed `> `) before insertion. Atom sidecars are
  //              ignored — the quote variant is plain-text only. Two-phase
  //              continuation like PASTE. Bound to ⌥⌘V.
  // PASTE_AS_PLAIN_TEXT: payload — none. Like PASTE, but Markdown
  //              formatting is stripped from the clipboard text (headings,
  //              emphasis, code, links → their text content) before
  //              insertion. Plain-text only; no atom sidecar. Bound to ⇧⌘V.
  // SELECT_ALL:  payload — none. The first responder selects all of its
  //              content. The handler calls document.execCommand("selectAll")
  //              — note the camelCase browser command name, not this
  //              kebab-case action name.
  // SELECT_NONE: payload — none. The first responder collapses its
  //              selection. NOTE: no responder currently registers a
  //              handler for this — dispatching is a silent no-op
  //              until a control wires it up.
  // COPY_COMMAND: payload — none. Copy the command span the right-click
  //              landed on (a command span in a transcript cell — see the
  //              annotator), preserving its code formatting:
  //              `text/plain` = the command in Markdown backticks,
  //              `text/html` = a `<code>` element. Menu-only (no keyboard
  //              binding); the handler reads the span text sampled at
  //              menu-open time, so it copies the WHOLE command regardless
  //              of any sub-word the browser smart-selected. Distinct from
  //              COPY, which copies the live selection.
  // COPY_COMMAND_AS_PLAIN_TEXT: payload — none. Like COPY_COMMAND but the
  //              bare command text only (`text/plain`, no backticks, no
  //              `text/html`) — the terminal-paste-friendly variant.
  // COPY_ANNOTATION_VALUE: payload — none. Copy the canonical value of the
  //              annotation the right-click landed on — the URL, the email
  //              address, the file path. Plain text only; the generalization
  //              of COPY_COMMAND_AS_PLAIN_TEXT to the kinds that have no
  //              code formatting to preserve. Menu-only; like the command
  //              copies, the handler reads the value sampled at menu-open
  //              time rather than the live selection, so it copies the
  //              WHOLE value regardless of any sub-word the browser
  //              smart-selected.
  // INSERT_INTO_COMPOSER: payload — none. Send the sampled annotation back
  //              into the conversation: activate the card, then insert it
  //              into the prompt composer at the caret. Menu-only. This is
  //              the "indirect action" every annotation kind offers — a
  //              URL, a path, or a command line becomes something to talk
  //              about rather than something to follow. A file arrives as
  //              the chip an `@` mention mints rather than as its path
  //              characters, so it reads as one object and travels as one;
  //              every other kind arrives as its text.
  // COPY_SESSION_ATOM: payload — none. Copy the session the right-click
  //              landed on as its atom: the citation as `text/plain` with the
  //              private atom sidecar beside it, so a paste back into any Tug
  //              editor returns the chip rather than the string. Also what a
  //              bare COPY over a session row means, so the ⌘C a reader
  //              reaches for first is the richest form.
  // COPY_SESSION_CITATION: payload — none. The same session as the flat
  //              sanctioned string — `<project>/<callsign> (<short id>)` —
  //              for anywhere outside Tug, where the sidecar means nothing.
  // COPY_SESSION_ID: payload — none. The session's full UUID, which is what
  //              every CLI verb and every JSONL path wants and what no
  //              rendered surface shows.
  // COPY_SESSION_DESCRIPTION: payload — none. The session's standing
  //              description IN FULL, past whatever the row had room for.
  // COPY_SESSION_ACTIVITY: payload — none. The newest live beat for that
  //              session. Only a beat copies: a rest sentence and a
  //              compaction pin are text the row composed rather than news
  //              the session sent, and the item is disabled when there is
  //              none.
  CUT:                 "cut",

  // ---- Editing ----
  //
  // UNDO:      payload — none. macOS semantics: the innermost editor
  //            responder handles it against its own history; if none is
  //            focused, the nearest ancestor that registered for undo
  //            handles it (tab reopen, layout restore, etc.).
  // REDO:      payload — none. Symmetric with undo.
  // DELETE:    payload — none. The first responder deletes its current
  //            selection (or the item at the focus point).
  // DUPLICATE: payload — none. The first responder duplicates its
  //            current selection.
  UNDO:      "undo",
  REDO:      "redo",
  DELETE:    "delete",
  DUPLICATE: "duplicate",

  // ---- Editing motion / deletion ----
  //
  // These four actions are dispatched by the substrate-local text-editing
  // keybinding registry in `text-editing-keybindings.ts`, NOT by the
  // global `keybinding-map.ts` capture-phase pipeline. Movement and
  // deletion only ever target the focused text input, so the chain
  // abstraction adds nothing — see [DM01] in
  // `tugplan-text-editing-keybindings.md` for the substrate-local
  // wiring rationale.
  //
  // Sender for all four: "the focused text-editing responder" (the
  // `useTextInputResponder`-backed input/textarea, or the
  // `tug-text-editor` editor responder). Handlers read selection
  // state from the focused element / view at dispatch time per [L07];
  // there is no payload on the ActionEvent.
  //
  // DELETE_TO_LINE_START:  payload — none. Erase backward from the caret
  //                        to the start of the current line. For
  //                        single-line `<input>` this means index 0;
  //                        for `<textarea>` and CM6, the index after
  //                        the last `\n` at-or-before the caret. Native
  //                        substrates route through
  //                        `document.execCommand("delete")` so the
  //                        WKWebView's NSUndoManager records the
  //                        operation per [L23] / [DM03]; CM6 uses
  //                        `deleteLineBoundaryBackward` which pushes
  //                        onto the editor's `history()` stack per
  //                        [DM04]. Bound to Ctrl-U.
  // DELETE_WORD_BACKWARD:  payload — none. Erase the word ending at (or
  //                        immediately preceding) the caret. Word
  //                        boundaries come from the substrate's own
  //                        definition (native: `findWordBoundaries`
  //                        from `text-selection-adapter.ts`; CM6:
  //                        `deleteGroupBackward`). Bound to Ctrl-W.
  // MOVE_WORD_FORWARD:     payload — none. Move the caret one word
  //                        forward. With Shift held, the substrate
  //                        handler extends the selection rather than
  //                        moving the caret per [DM05]. Native
  //                        substrates read `event.shiftKey` from the
  //                        keystroke; CM6 uses the keymap entry's
  //                        `shift:` slot to bind `selectGroupForward`.
  //                        Chain dispatch (no native event) defaults
  //                        to no shift — settings/menu dispatch never
  //                        extends selection. Bound to Alt-F (Option-F).
  // MOVE_WORD_BACKWARD:    payload — none. Symmetric with
  //                        MOVE_WORD_FORWARD. Bound to Alt-B (Option-B).
  DELETE_TO_LINE_START: "delete-to-line-start",
  DELETE_WORD_BACKWARD: "delete-word-backward",
  MOVE_WORD_FORWARD:    "move-word-forward",
  MOVE_WORD_BACKWARD:   "move-word-backward",

  // ---- Submission ----
  //
  // TUG_ACTIONS.SUBMIT:
  //     payload — none. Dispatched by a form or submission-shaped
  //     control to mean "commit the current draft intent." The
  //     responder handler reads the live state from the store or
  //     delegate at dispatch time (per [L07]) to decide what
  //     "commit" means — send, interrupt, save, etc. For
  //     TugPromptEntry, the single action covers both send and
  //     interrupt depending on `snap.canInterrupt` at dispatch
  //     time (see plan [D05] for the submit/interrupt unification
  //     rationale). Phase is always `discrete`.
  //     sender — typically the submit button's id; handlers
  //     generally do not narrow on sender because any submit
  //     dispatch routed to the handler means the same thing.
  SUBMIT: "submit",

  // REMOVE_ATTACHMENT: payload — `value: string` (the atom id of the
  //     attachment to drop). Dispatched by the compose-phase attachment
  //     preview's ✕ / Delete controls; the prompt-entry responder owns
  //     the editor document + bytes store, so it handles the action by
  //     removing the atom and freeing its bytes. Phase `discrete`.
  REMOVE_ATTACHMENT: "remove-attachment",

  // ---- Navigation ----
  //
  // PREVIOUS_TAB:   payload — none. Step to the previous card in the
  //                 deck's lateral ring: every tab of every visible pane
  //                 (front of each slot / rail, plus free panes; the
  //                 sidebars ride it, Lens included), one ring. Within a
  //                 pane it is a tab switch; at a pane's first tab it
  //                 crosses into the previous pane's last. Handled by the
  //                 deck canvas, which owns the geometry.
  // NEXT_TAB:       payload — none. The lateral ring's other direction.
  // FOCUS_NEXT:     payload — none. Move keyboard focus to the next
  //                 focusable responder. NOTE: no handler yet —
  //                 ⇥/⇧⇥ are deferred per the A3 / R4 retrospective.
  //                 Dispatching is a silent no-op until a chain-wide
  //                 focus-next implementation lands.
  // FOCUS_PREVIOUS: payload — none. Move keyboard focus to the previous
  //                 focusable responder. NOTE: no handler yet — see
  //                 FOCUS_NEXT.
  // FOCUS_PROMPT:   payload — none. Move keyboard focus into the key
  //                 card's prompt input. Used by ⌘K, scoped to
  //                 `scope: "key-card"`. Non-prompt cards (gallery,
  //                 git) don't register a handler; the dispatch is a
  //                 no-op and `preventDefaultOnMatch` suppresses the
  //                 native beep.
  // MOVE_TO_SLOT:   payload — `value: number` (1-based slot number).
  //                 Deck-level: put the selected card at slot N of the
  //                 active imposition. Used by ⌘1..9, handled by the deck
  //                 canvas, which owns the layout tree. The whole digit
  //                 row is bound so an out-of-range number is inert rather
  //                 than beeping: the handler no-ops when there is no
  //                 imposition, when nothing is selected, when the
  //                 selection is the Lens, or when N exceeds the
  //                 arrangement's slot count.
  // SET_PANE_WIDTH: payload — `value: string` (a `ContentWidth`: slim /
  //                 comfy / wide). Deck-level: put the SELECTED card's pane
  //                 at that named width. Used by ⌃⌘1..3 (Window ▸ Slim /
  //                 Comfy / Wide), handled by the deck canvas, which owns
  //                 the layout tree. The pane-addressed sibling
  //                 `SET_CARD_WIDTH` is the title bar's popup — the popup
  //                 names the pane it opened on, this one means "the pane
  //                 I am in". Both land on `setPaneWidth`, so the clamp and
  //                 the `widthPreset` stamp are the same on either door.
  // TOGGLE_BULLSEYE: payload — none. Deck-level: put the SELECTED card's
  //                 pane in bullseye — centered in the band at the comfy
  //                 width, with every other pane receded — or take it out
  //                 when it is already there. Used by ⌃⌘B (Window ▸
  //                 Bullseye), handled by the deck canvas, which owns the
  //                 layout tree and is the one responder that can name
  //                 which pane the selection is in. One action, not two:
  //                 unlike SET_PANE_WIDTH / SET_CARD_WIDTH, bullseye's two
  //                 doors (the chord and the menu item) share one idea of
  //                 "which pane" — the pane I am in. A rail is refused.
  // REVEAL_STACK:   payload — none. Open the focused pane's slot-stack
  //                 picker — the title-bar menu listing every pane sharing
  //                 its slot. Used by ⌘R (Window ▸ Reveal Stack), answered
  //                 by the pane, which delegates to its title bar's
  //                 `revealStack()` handle. The handle toggles: this very
  //                 dispatch reaches an open menu's `observeDispatch`
  //                 subscription, and the responder action runs before any
  //                 observer, so a toggle is the one form that is
  //                 single-valued in both directions. The host validates
  //                 the item disabled below depth 2, so an inert press
  //                 never reaches here.
  // NEXT_STACK_CARD: payload — none. Bring the pane that has been buried
  //                 longest in the focused pane's slot to the front — the
  //                 depth axis of card navigation, the no-look counterpart
  //                 to REVEAL_STACK. ⌥⌘] (Window ▸ Next Card in Stack);
  //                 answered by the pane, which raises the LAST entry of
  //                 the `slotStack` it already renders its badge from.
  //                 Raising the bottom-most is what makes repeated presses
  //                 a ring: each raise sends the outgoing pane to the
  //                 back, so a depth-N slot returns home after N presses.
  //                 It is also ⌘`'s convention for windows. The host
  //                 validates the item disabled below depth 2, so an inert
  //                 press never reaches here.
  // PREVIOUS_STACK_CARD: payload — none. The exact inverse: send the
  //                 focused pane to the back of its slot's stack, fronting
  //                 the pane beneath it. ⌥⌘[ (Window ▸ Previous Card in
  //                 Stack); answered by the pane, which demotes itself via
  //                 `sendPaneBehind` and activates the next entry — a true
  //                 rotation, so NEXT undoes PREVIOUS at every depth
  //                 (raising the second-from-top instead would ping-pong).
  //                 Same depth-2 gate as its pair.
  // SELECT_COMPOSER_ROUTE: payload — `value: "prompt" | "changes"`. Select
  //                 one of the composer's two routes directly (as opposed to
  //                 TOGGLE_CHANGES_VIEW, which flips between them). Bound to
  //                 ⌃⌘P for `"prompt"`, scoped `scope: "key-card"`, handled
  //                 by the session card's card-content responder, which
  //                 applies it through `CommitModeController` — the single
  //                 home of the route selection. Non-session cards register
  //                 no handler, so the dispatch is a silent no-op
  //                 (`preventDefaultOnMatch` suppresses the macOS beep).
  // CYCLE_PERMISSION_MODE: payload — none. Advance the session-card's
  //                 permission mode one step (default → acceptEdits →
  //                 plan → auto → default). Bound to ⌃⌥⌘P, scoped
  //                 `scope: "key-card"`, handled by the session card's
  //                 card-content responder. Non-dev cards register no
  //                 handler, so the dispatch is a silent no-op
  //                 (`preventDefaultOnMatch` suppresses the macOS beep).
  // INTERRUPT_SESSION: payload — none. Stop the in-flight turn:
  //                 Session ▸ Stop's control-frame round-trip (Both
  //                 category). The session card's card-content responder
  //                 calls `codeSessionStore.interrupt()`. Deliberately
  //                 NOT Escape's CANCEL_DIALOG walk — the menu item
  //                 always means interrupt; enablement (`canInterrupt`,
  //                 published via menuState) is the only gate.
  // CYCLE_FOCUS_MODE: payload — none. Toggle a text-first card's
  //                 keyboard-focus-cycling mode on/off — the mode in which
  //                 Tab circulates the card's chrome zones instead of feeding
  //                 the editor (the session card is the first consumer). Bound to
  //                 ⌥⇥, scoped `scope: "key-card"`; the trigger / Escape exit
  //                 back to the editor caret. The handler (a per-card cycle
  //                 focus-scope) lands with the cycle-mode mechanism; until then
  //                 the binding matches and suppresses the native default, but
  //                 the dispatch is a silent no-op. The focus-walk stage bails
  //                 on any modifier, so ⌥⇥ reaches this binding rather than
  //                 being consumed as a reverse-tab.
  // NEXT_KEYBOARD_FOCUS / PREVIOUS_KEYBOARD_FOCUS: payload — none. Advance the
  //                 keyboard focus ring one stop forward / back in the current
  //                 mode's authored order — what ⇥ and ⇧⇥ do once the focus
  //                 walk's precedence ladder has declined. `registry` routing
  //                 into `advanceKeyViewFocus`, because the ring is engine
  //                 state and no responder owns it. The View menu items carry
  //                 NO key equivalent: AppKit scans key equivalents before the
  //                 web view sees a keydown, so a literal ⇥ there would
  //                 confiscate Tab app-wide — above completion-accept, above
  //                 CM6's indentWithTab, above every native fallback.
  // RUN_SLASH_COMMAND: payload — `value: { name, args }` (a matched local
  //                 slash command + any trailing args). The prompt entry
  //                 dispatches it key-card-scoped when a typed `/command`
  //                 matches the local registry (`lib/slash-commands.ts`);
  //                 the session card's card-content responder handles it by
  //                 opening the command's graphical surface ([D23]).
  //                 Transport-independent — not gated on send-readiness.
  //                 A host with no handler leaves it unhandled, so the
  //                 prompt entry sends the text to claude instead.
  // INSERT_SLASH_COMMAND: payload — `value: { name }` (a command name). The
  //                 session card's card-content responder forwards it to the
  //                 prompt entry's `insertCommandChip`, seeding a leading
  //                 command chip ([P07]). Nothing dispatches it today: no
  //                 chord is assigned and no menu item names it, so the
  //                 handler is reachable only by an explicit dispatch.
  // OPEN_COMMAND_PICKER: payload — none. ⌘/ dispatches it key-card-scoped; the
  //                 session card's card-content responder forwards to the
  //                 prompt entry's `openCommandPicker` ([P06]).
  // INSERT_FILE:    payload — `value: { path }` (an absolute path). The host's
  //                 Session ▸ Insert File… item runs an NSOpenPanel and sends
  //                 the chosen path; ⌘I reaches the same item. Routed
  //                 first-responder and answered in two places: the prompt
  //                 entry itself, which inserts a `file` atom (basename
  //                 label, absolute value) at its caret — the shape an `@`
  //                 mention accepts — and the session card's card-content
  //                 responder, which forwards to its composer's delegate so
  //                 focus anywhere in the card still lands the file. A card
  //                 with no prompt entry answers neither, and that unhandled
  //                 walk is what dims the menu item.
  // SHOW_SLASH_COMMAND_NOTICE: payload — `value: { name, commandLine, reason }`
  //                 where `reason` is `"unknown"` (no such command — a typo) or
  //                 `"unsupported"` (a real Claude Code command with no meaning
  //                 over the bridge — the hidden set). The prompt entry
  //                 dispatches it key-card-scoped for a typed `/command` that
  //                 the session card will not run; the card-content responder
  //                 presents a `TugAlertSheet` with reason-appropriate text
  //                 instead of silently dropping it or burning a turn
  //                 ([#step-13a]). For `unknown`, a host with no handler leaves
  //                 it unhandled so the prompt entry falls through to claude;
  //                 a hidden command is never sent to claude regardless.
  // PREVIOUS_TURN / NEXT_TURN: payload — none. Step the session card's
  //                 transcript one turn (one entry) backward / forward,
  //                 pinning the target turn's top flush to the viewport
  //                 top. Bound to ⌥⌘↑ / ⌥⌘↓, `scope: "key-card"`, so the
  //                 chord walks from the first responder up to the
  //                 card-content responder regardless of where focus
  //                 sits in the card (transcript, prompt editor, status
  //                 bar) — unlike the list view's own scroll-container
  //                 PageUp/PageDown pager, which only fires when the
  //                 transcript holds focus. ⌥↑/⌥↓ are deliberately NOT
  //                 used (they are editor word-movement). The handler
  //                 drives `SessionTranscriptHandle.pageByEntry`.
  // FIRST_TURN / LAST_TURN: payload — none. Jump the session card's
  //                 transcript to the very top / very bottom (Home /
  //                 End). Bound to ⌥⇧⌘↑ / ⌥⇧⌘↓, `scope: "key-card"`,
  //                 same card-wide routing as PREVIOUS_TURN/NEXT_TURN.
  //                 FIRST_TURN drives `SessionTranscriptHandle.scrollToTop`
  //                 (disengages follow-bottom); LAST_TURN drives
  //                 `scrollToBottom` (re-engages follow-bottom at the
  //                 live edge).

  // ---- Control value ----
  //
  // SET_VALUE:       payload — shape depends on control:
  //                    - sliders, value-inputs: `value: number`
  //                    - inputs, textareas:     `value: string`

  //                  useId). Handlers disambiguate multi-control forms
  //                  by inspecting sender.
  //                  phase — sliders and scrubbable controls use
  //                  "begin" / "change" / "commit" for interactive
  //                  dragging. Discrete changes use "discrete".
  // TOGGLE:          payload — `value: boolean` (the new state). Used by
  //                  checkboxes, switches, and expand/collapse controls.
  //                  sender — stable sender id.
  // SELECT_VALUE:    payload — `value: string` (the selected item id).
  //                  Used by radio groups, choice groups, dropdowns,
  //                  tab bars.
  //                  sender — stable sender id identifying which control
  //                  or group dispatched the selection.
  // INCREMENT_VALUE: payload — optional `value: number` (step override).
  //                  Used by numeric scrubbers on arrow-up.
  // DECREMENT_VALUE: payload — optional `value: number` (step override).
  //                  Used by numeric scrubbers on arrow-down.
  // SET_COLOR:       payload — `value: TugColorSpec` ({ hue, adjacent?, i, t, a }).
  //                  Dispatched by the standalone TugColorPicker via
  //                  sendToTarget(targetId, …) to the host responder that owns
  //                  the active color well; sender — the well's stable sender id,
  //                  so a multi-well host routes the edit to the right color.
  // ACTIVATE_COLOR_WELL: payload — `value: TugColorSpec` (the well's current
  //                  color) plus optional `label: string`. Dispatched by a
  //                  TugColorWell to its parent responder on click; the host
  //                  records itself as the active color target (active-color-
  //                  target.ts) so the picker knows what to edit. sender — the

  //             Dispatched by card-level "new tab" controls (e.g. the
  //             tab bar's `+` popup-button menu). The responder that
  //             handles it (typically `TugPane`) uses its own cardId
  //             plus the componentId from the payload to call
  //             `store.addTab(cardId, componentId)`. Distinct from
  //             `add-card-to-active-pane`, which is the global
  //             menu/keystroke path that targets the focused pane with
  //             a hardcoded component type.
  // REOPEN_TAB: payload — none. Restore the most recently closed tab.
  //             NOTE: no handler yet — ⌘⇧T is deferred per the A3 / R4
  //             retrospective pending a closed-tab history in

  // ---- Document viewing ----
  //
  // A paged document surface — today the viewer card's PDF branch — owns
  // these while it is the first responder. They are deliberately generic:
  // a second paged viewer would register the same handlers rather than
  // grow a parallel vocabulary.
  //
  // SCROLL_DOCUMENT: payload — `value: { axis: "horizontal" | "vertical";
  //                  amount: "line" | "page" | "document"; direction: -1 | 1 }`.
  //                  One action behind every navigation key, because what a
  //                  key should do depends on the surface's current mode:
  //                  the same ↓ scrolls in a continuously-scrolled document
  //                  and turns the page in a paged one. The handler owns
  //                  that reading; the binding only says how far and which
  //                  way.
  // SET_PAGE_MODE:   payload — `value: "continuous" | "single" | "two"`.
  //                  How pages are grouped and laid out.
  // ZOOM_IN / ZOOM_OUT: payload — none. Step the surface's zoom ladder.
  // ZOOM_ACTUAL:     payload — none. Return to 1:1.
  // ZOOM_TO_FIT:     payload — `value: "width" | "page"`. Fit the current
  //                  page to the surface by width, or whole. A fit is stored
  //                  as the choice rather than the scale it measured, so it
  //                  re-fits when the surface resizes.

  TOGGLE_SECTION: "toggle-section",

  // ---- Pane / card ----
  //
  // CLOSE:                  payload — none. Close the first card responder.
  // CLOSE_ALL:              payload — none. Close every tab in the focused
  //                         multi-card pane (the pane goes away). The pane's
  //                         registered handler pops the "Close N Tabs?"
  //                         confirm when any hosted card opts into
  //                         `confirmClose`, closes immediately otherwise.
  //                         Dispatched by File ▸ Close All Card Tabs (⌥⌘W).
  // CLOSE_PANE:             payload — none. Close the whole pane addressed by
  //                         the dispatch's target — the pane's own X button,
  //                         aimed from somewhere else. The handler runs the
  //                         title bar's close flow entire: every hosted card's
  //                         save guard first, then the pane's confirm policy
  //                         ("Close N Tabs?" on a multi-tab pane). Distinct
  //                         from CLOSE_ALL, whose confirm is per-card because
  //                         its caller is a deliberate menu command; this one
  //                         answers a close box in a list, where a stray click
  //                         must never destroy a stack outright. Sent with
  //                         `sendToTarget(paneId, …)` — the pane registers it
  //                         under its own id.
  // MINIMIZE:               payload — none. Minimize the first card.
  // MAXIMIZE:               payload — none. Maximize the first card.
  // SHOW_COMPONENT_GALLERY: payload — none. Open or focus the gallery card.
  // SHOW_SETTINGS:          payload — none. Open the settings panel.
  // SHOW_KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS: payload — none. Open or focus the Keyboard
  //                         Shortcuts card.
  // SHOW_DEVTOOLS:          payload — none. Open or focus the DevTools card.
  // FOCUS_LENS:             payload — none. Move focus into the Lens (opening it
  //                         if hidden); a second dispatch focuses back out.
  // TOGGLE_LENS:            payload — none. Show/hide the Lens rail.
  // TOGGLE_JOTS:            payload — none. Show/hide the Jots rail. The
  //                         sibling of TOGGLE_LENS: ⌃⌘⟨letter⟩ is the
  //                         sidebar-toggle grammar, so the pair is
  //                         self-teaching.
  // TOGGLE_GAZETTE:         payload — none. Show/hide the Gazette rail. Third
  //                         in the ⌃⌘⟨letter⟩ sidebar-toggle grammar, beside
  //                         TOGGLE_LENS and TOGGLE_JOTS.
  // NEW_JOT:                payload — none. Capture a jot in one gesture:
  //                         reveal the Jots card if it is hidden, create an
  //                         empty jot, and land the caret in its editor.
  // RESET_LAYOUT:           payload — none. Reset card positions.
  // ADD_CARD_TO_ACTIVE_PANE: payload — none. Add a new card to the active pane
  //                         via the global menu / ⌘T (canvas targets the first responder).
  // FIND:                   payload — none. Open the find UI for the first
  //                         searchable responder.
  // FIND_NEXT:              payload — none. Advance to the next match against
  //                         the active find query. The first responder up the
  //                         chain that owns a find session handles it.
  //                         Empty / invalid query → no-op so the keystroke
  //                         doesn't accidentally seed a query from the
  //                         current selection. Dispatched by ⌘G.
  // FIND_PREVIOUS:          payload — none. Symmetric with FIND_NEXT.
  //                         Dispatched by ⇧⌘G.

// ---- Payload narrowing — how handlers read `event.value` safely ----
//
// `ActionEvent.value` is typed as `unknown` by design (see the file
// header for the "middle ground" rationale: one action per semantic,
// rich payloads documented per-action above rather than baked into
// the type system). Handlers that read `event.value` need a
// narrowing step before using it. Two patterns are in use across
// the codebase; each fits a different shape of handler.
//
// ### Pattern 1 — form-slot narrowing via `useResponderForm`
//
// This is the dominant pattern. Components built on top of
// `useResponderForm` (every A2.1–A2.7 control: checkbox, switch,
// radio, choice, tab bar, accordion, popup button, slider,
// value-input, text input, textarea) register their handlers
// through typed slots:
//
// ```ts
// useResponderForm({
//   toggle: { [senderId]: (v: boolean) => setChecked(v) },
//   setValueNumber: { [senderId]: (v: number, phase) => setValue(v) },
//   selectValue: { [selectGroupId]: (v: string) => setSelected(v) },
// });
// ```
//
// The hook narrows at the slot boundary (`typeof event.value !==
// "boolean"` / `"string"` / `"number"`, `Array.isArray` for
// string[] slots) and invokes the typed setter only on a match. The
// *setter's type signature is the enforcement mechanism*: consumers
// literally cannot write `(v: unknown) => …`, because the slot's
// declared type forces them to annotate the value parameter with
// the narrowed type. One narrowing point per slot, one typed
// contract at each call site. Consumers never touch `event.value`
// themselves.
//
// This is structurally safer than any ad-hoc narrowing utility and
// should be the default path for any form-style control.
//
// ### Pattern 2 — inline `typeof` gates for direct-dispatch responders
//
// A handful of non-form responders handle actions outside the
// `useResponderForm` abstraction: cards dispatching `setProperty` /
// `addTab`, the editor text-input suite dispatching clipboard
// actions, gallery demos dispatching their preview actions. These
// handlers read `event.value` directly and must guard it inline
// before use:
//
// ```ts
// [TUG_ACTIONS.ADD_TAB]: (event: ActionEvent) => {
//   if (typeof event.value !== "string") return;
//   store.addTab(cardId, event.value);
// },
//
// [TUG_ACTIONS.SET_PROPERTY]: (event: ActionEvent) => {
//   const payload = event.value as
//     | { path: string; value: unknown; source?: string }
//     | undefined;
//   if (!payload || typeof payload.path !== "string") return;
//   store.set(payload.path, payload.value, payload.source ?? "inspector");
// },
// ```
//
// Inline `typeof` for primitives; cast-plus-field-check for
// structured payloads whose shape can't be expressed in `typeof`.
// Both patterns early-return on mismatch so a wrong-shape dispatch
// is a silent no-op rather than a runtime crash.
//
// ### Why no `narrowValue` helper
//
// A Phase A1 proposal added a `narrowValue<T>(event, guard)`
// utility intended to standardize Pattern 2. It was never adopted:
// by the time A2.4 shipped, `useResponderForm` had absorbed
// narrowing into its slot contracts (Pattern 1), and the few
// remaining direct-dispatch handlers found inline `typeof` to be
// shorter than writing a type guard for `narrowValue` to consume.
// The utility was removed in A6 as dead code with zero call sites.
// If per-action payload discriminated unions ever become
// worthwhile, that's the successor — not a handler-level helper.
