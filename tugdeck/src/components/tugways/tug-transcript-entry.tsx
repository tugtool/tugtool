/**
 * TugTranscriptEntry — Slot-based transcript-row primitive.
 *
 * Renders one participant's contribution to a transcript: a left-aligned
 * icon column, then a body column with bold identifier + optional small
 * timestamp, the body slot, and an optional controls slot beneath. Slack-
 * style — no per-row container, no chat bubbles, no left-vs-right
 * alignment by speaker.
 *
 * Three participants are supported: `user`, `assistant`, `shell`.
 * Per-variant differences come exclusively from `[data-participant="..."]`
 * cascade onto `--tugx-transcript-*` tokens — adding a participant is a
 * token + a registry entry, never a primitive edit.
 *
 * `body` and `controls` are `React.ReactNode` slots; the primitive imposes
 * no opinion on text rendering. Consumers pass markdown views, atom-flavored
 * text, or structured renderers as the situation calls for.
 *
 * No production wiring lives in this primitive. Live transcript binding
 * (CodeSessionStore, streaming, atom rendering for user submissions) is
 * the consumer's concern.
 *
 * ## Pin-stack contract — `--tugx-pin-stack-top`
 *
 * The `__pin` wrapper — ONE sticky element per entry, carrying both the
 * gutter icon and the attribution header — is `position: sticky; top: 0;
 * z-index: 2` (see the .css pair) so the speaker icon + identifier +
 * timestamp remain visible while a long entry body scrolls past —
 * multi-hunk DiffBlocks, tall TerminalBlocks, deep FileBlocks. One
 * sticky per entry instead of the earlier two (icon and header pinned
 * independently) matters at transcript scale: every sticky element is a
 * compositing-overlap candidate WebKit re-tests each rendering update,
 * and a long session mounts thousands of entries. Block-level pinned
 * chrome inside the entry body (FileBlock / DiffBlock / TerminalBlock /
 * fenced-code headers + their actions rows; BlockChrome's header)
 * consumes the variable `--tugx-pin-stack-top` to telescope BELOW the
 * entry header rather than overlap it.
 *
 * To make that work, every mounted entry joins its scroller's shared
 * {@link PinStackController}, which measures ONE representative pin
 * (all pins under one scroller share the same one-line header
 * geometry) and writes the height to `--tugx-pin-stack-top` on the
 * scroll container via `style.setProperty`. The variable cascades to
 * every entry's descendants so any sticky header in the body can
 * stack underneath without each consumer needing to query the
 * entry's geometry. The same controller stamps `data-stuck` on
 * whichever pins are displaced by their sticky positioning, computed
 * on the scroll event rather than observed per entry — the controller
 * docstring carries the cost argument. Entries with no scroll
 * ancestor fall back to a local per-entry measurement onto the root.
 *
 * Laws:
 *  - [L03] registration runs in `useLayoutEffect` (before paint) so
 *    the first sticky pass in the children sees a correct offset
 *    rather than a one-frame-late value.
 *  - [L06] the variable and the stuck flag are written to DOM via
 *    `style.setProperty` / `dataset`, never to React state.
 *    Appearance flows through CSS, not renders.
 *  - [L19] file pair, module docstring, exported props interface,
 *    `data-slot="tug-transcript-entry"` on the root.
 *  - [L20] component-token sovereignty — only `--tugx-transcript-*`
 *    drives variant differences; `--tugx-pin-stack-top` is the
 *    contract this primitive WRITES (entry-header height), not a
 *    redefinition of any neighbor's slot.
 *  - [L27] joining the controller returns the release that leaves it.

 * bookkeeping on every rendering update, observed element by observed
 * element (`gatherObservations` reads each box, IO geometry-maps each
 * target), so a deck of restored transcripts paid hundreds of
 * per-update reads while sitting perfectly still. Hoisted here, the
 * idle cost is zero:
 *
 *  - **Height** is one observation. Every pin in a scroller is the

 *    on the scroller and inherited by every entry. (The scroller's
 *    own selector-based default — see `session-card.css` — stays the
 *    static fallback; the inline write wins on the same element.)
 *  - **Stuck state** only changes when the scroller scrolls, so it is
 *    computed on the scroll event, coalesced to one pass per frame. A
 *    pin displaced below its natural position IS the stuck state
 *    (`pin.top > root.top + ε`) — no sentinel geometry, no per-update
 *    observer walk. Pins inside skipped `content-visibility: auto`
 *    cells are excluded via `checkVisibility` BEFORE any rect read:
 *    geometry queries force layout of skipped subtrees, and a pass
 *    that un-skipped the whole transcript every scroll frame would
 *    cost more than the observers it replaces.

 * otherwise — the CSS keys on the `"true"` value alone, and absent
 * attributes cost no mutation delivery at mount.
