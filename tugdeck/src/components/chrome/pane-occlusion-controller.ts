/**
 * pane-occlusion-controller.ts — sole authority for the `data-occluded` DOM
 * attribute on every `.tug-pane[data-pane-id]` element within the deck root.
 *
 * A pane whose frame rect is fully covered by a single opaque pane above it
 * in z-order gets `data-occluded="true"`; tug-pane.css turns that into
 * `visibility: hidden` across the frame's whole subtree, so WebKit drops the
 * pane's graphics tile backing while layout, scroll positions, editor state,
 * eviction ledgers, and running animations are all preserved (visibility
 * invalidates paint only — nothing is unmounted, nothing re-measures).
 *
 * Timing is asymmetric, by design:
 *
 *  - REVEALS are synchronous. The apply pass runs in `useLayoutEffect` after
 *    every store commit (and on canvas resize), so the visibility flip lands
 *    in the same paint as the z-order / geometry change that exposed the
 *    pane — the compositor never presents a frame with an exposed-but-hidden
 *    pane. Raise, close of a covering pane, deck restore, resize, and
 *    imposition changes all reach this path through the store snapshot.
 *
 *  - HIDES are lazy. Newly-covered panes are stamped only after a settle
 *    delay, and only while no pane frame carries a running animation or
 *    transition (the imposition FLIP tween, the collapse height transition
 *    — both live on the frame element), so a pane is never hidden while its
 *    coverer is still visually en route to the rect that covers it.
 *
 * Geometry is read as `offset*` — untransformed layout pixels in the shared
 * container space — so a mid-FLIP inverse transform never pollutes the
 * decision: occlusion always describes the committed arrangement. Z-order is
 * read back from each frame's inline `z-index`, which React renders from the
 * store's pane order in the same commit this controller's effect follows.
 *
 * Appearance-zone gestures (drag, resize, Lens resize) move frames without
 * store commits, so the three gesture machines in `tug-pane.tsx` bracket
 * their moves with `paneOcclusionGesture.begin()` / `.end()`: begin reveals
 * every pane immediately and blocks hides for the duration; end re-arms the
 * settle pass. The commit at gesture end then recomputes from final geometry.
 *
 * The occlusion test is honest about paint, conservatively:
 *  - a coverer counts only when its chrome's computed background alpha is 1
 *    and both frame and chrome have `opacity: 1`;
 *  - rounded corners are accounted for — a covered corner must either
 *    coincide with the coverer's corner (equal-or-smaller radius, so the
 *    rounding masks align) or clear the coverer's corner-rounding zone;
 *  - only single-coverer containment counts (no union coverage), and the
 *    active pane is never occluded.
 * When the test cannot prove coverage it leaves the pane visible — the
 * failure mode is a missed hide, never a hidden exposed pane. The one
 * accepted paint delta is the buried pane's own drop shadow (it paints
 * outside the covered rect); stacked identical shadows compose to a
 * near-identical ring, verified invisible in the live probe.
 *
 * Tuglaws: [L03] layout-effect registration; [L06] occlusion is appearance
 * state, written to the DOM, never React state; [L10] one responsibility;
 * [L22] store observation drives direct DOM mutation from geometry the deck
 * already owns; [L23] a hidden pane keeps every piece of user-observable
 * state and is restored by a paint-only flip.
