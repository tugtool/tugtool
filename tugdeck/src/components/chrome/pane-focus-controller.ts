/**
 * pane-focus-controller.ts — sole authority for the `data-focused` DOM
 * attribute on every `.tug-pane[data-pane-id]` element within the deck root,
 * and the consumer that turns the gesture interpreter's activation and
 * deselect decisions into store mutations.
 *
 * **Attribute authority.**
 *   - Reads: the store's `activePaneId` (snapshot-reactive via
 *     `useSyncExternalStore`) and the deck root ref.
 *   - Writes: `data-focused="true"` on the active pane's frame,
 *     `data-focused="false"` on every other pane's frame. Writes happen in
 *     `useLayoutEffect` post-commit so newly-mounted panes receive their
 *     attribute before paint — no flicker.
 *   - React no longer renders `data-focused` from a prop; React's reconciler
 *     therefore never considers or clobbers this attribute.
 *
 * **Deselect lives in the DOM, not React.** Deselect is expressed as "write
 * `data-focused="false"` on every pane" — there is no separate
 * `data-deselected` attribute, no React state, no mask CSS rules. Selection is
 * exactly "which pane is `activePaneId`".
 *
 * **Gesture classification lives in `gesture-interpreter.ts`.** This module
 * installs the interpreter and consumes two of its decisions —
 * `activation: "activate"` (run the focus transfer) and
 * `activation: "deselect"` (clear the active card). The preservation behaviors
 * that used to be spelled out here — Cmd-click on a pane does not activate, a
 * background close-box click does not activate, primary button only, deferred
 * activation for a gesture that starts on draggable content, the post-drag
 * pointer-stream resync — are all classification, and live in the interpreter
 * with the rest of the pointer stream.
 *
 * **Pointer→click z-index ordering.** Classification runs synchronously in
 * capture phase and `store.activateCard` mutates synchronously;
 * `useSyncExternalStore` forces a sync re-render for external-store updates
 * outside a React event handler, so the browser's pointer→click sequence for
 * clicks on interactive elements in background panes is preserved.
 *
 * Tuglaws:
 *   - **L03** — `useLayoutEffect` for event-dependent registration, so the
 *     interpreter's listeners are installed before paint (and before the
 *     provider's consumers, which this effect's position in the tree
 *     guarantees).
 *   - **L06** — pane focus is appearance state; lives in the DOM.
 *   - **L07** — `applyFocusRef` holds the latest closure so the reactive apply
 *     reads current state at event-time, not from a stale mount-time closure.
 *   - **L10** — controller owns exactly one responsibility: pane focus
 *     authority.
 *   - **L11** — pane activation is DeckManager-owned state mutation.
 *   - **L22** — store observation drives direct DOM mutation, no round-trip
 *     through React state.
 *   - **L23** — pane activation and the deselect visual are user-observable
 *     state, preserved across the refactor.
