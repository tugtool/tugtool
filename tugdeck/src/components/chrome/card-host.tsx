/**
 * CardHost — wiring harness for a card's per-content state.
 *
 * CardHost lives at the deck level in the React tree; its DOM output
 * portals into the host pane's content `<div>` via `CardPortal`, so
 * React-tree position (and therefore identity) stays stable across
 * cross-pane moves — the mechanism that preserves tide card sessions
 * across detach / merge / pane-to-pane moves.
 *
 * Per-concern state is delegated to hooks under `tugways/hooks/`:
 * `useCardPropertyStore`, `useCardDirtyState`, and `useCardFeedStore`.
 * The harness itself owns only the cross-cutting wiring:
 * `hostContentEl` / `hostCardRootEl` registry lookups, the per-card
 * `saveCurrentCardState` closure, state-preservation-callback registration,
 * the `registerSaveCallback(cardId, …)` binding into DeckManager, the
 * card-level responder that routes `SET_PROPERTY`, and the
 * context-provider tree wrapping the content factory.
 *
 * ## Restoration
 *
 * CardHost orchestrates restore for every axis of `CardStateBag`;
 * per-axis translation is delegated to the axis's owner (see [L10]).
 * Restoration is trigger-driven, not React-dep-gated:
 *
 *   1. **Content restore** fires from a CardHost-owned
 *      `useLayoutEffect` keyed on `[cardId, hostContentEl, store]`,
 *      after `registerStatePreservationCallbacks` has merely stored the
 *      child's callbacks. CardHost's effects fire AFTER CardPortal's
 *      own `useLayoutEffect` has appended the portal slot to the
 *      host pane's content element — so the engine root is
 *      connected to the document at the moment `onRestore(bag.content)`
 *      runs and any `engine.setSelectedRange` (`.focus()` + `addRange`)
 *      inside it lands on a live node. This is the L04 ready-callback
 *      pattern; doing the restore synchronously inside
 *      `registerStatePreservationCallbacks` (called from a CHILD's effect,
 *      before the parent CardPortal can attach the slot) was the
 *      cold-boot selection-paint bug ([AT0010]). A `hasAppliedContentRestoreRef` guard keeps the
 *      restore one-shot so cross-pane moves (which re-fire the
 *      effect via `hostContentEl` change) don't clobber engine
 *      state the user may have edited since first mount. The
 *      effect also installs `onContentReady` (scroll restore +
 *      opacity unmask) before invoking `onRestore`.
 *   2. **Mount restore effect** (a `useLayoutEffect` keyed on
 *      `[cardId, hostStackId, hostContentEl]`) applies `bag.scroll`
 *      to `hostContentEl`, publishes `bag.domSelection` to
 *      `selectionGuard` (translation via `restoreCardDomSelection`),
 *      dispatches `bag.focus` via `applyBagFocus` when this card is
 *      the active card of the active pane ([D10]), and replays
 *      `bag.formControls` + `bag.regionScroll` via a single
 *      `MutationObserver` scoped to the card root so late-mounting
 *      elements restore when they appear. The `MutationObserver`
 *      also retries `applyBagFocus` for `deferred-dom` resolutions
 *      until the target appears or the 200-mutation / 5s budget
 *      exhausts (Phase E.11 D5 late-mount settle). Late-mounting
 *      engines drive their retry via the `subscribeEngineHooksChange`
 *      channel that bumps `engineHooksVersion`, which joins the
 *      effect's dep array.
 * Cross-pane-move focus restore is no longer a CardHost concern —
 * it lives in `focus-transfer.ts#transferFocusAfterMove`, called
 * from `deck-manager.ts#_detachCard` / `_moveCardToPane` (the
 * `[hostStackId]`-keyed effect that
 * previously lived here was removed). CardHost's mount-time restore (the
 * primary effect above) remains the cold-boot focus authority.
 *
 * Paint of the restored DOM selection is not CardHost's job — that's
 * selection-guard's paint authority, driven by its deck-store
 * subscription. CardHost's responsibility is to hand the snapshot to
 * the axis's owner at the right moment; the owner paints.
 *
 * Neither path uses `cardStatePreservationCallbacksRef` as a dep — refs do not
 * trigger re-renders, and a dep array is not how we coordinate. The
 * trigger is the store callsite (register, or host-element change).

  // mounts conditionally (e.g. tide-card gates on `feedsReady` — its

    //      intentional (e.g. the user genuinely clicked away from
    //      every keyed element while still inside the card).
    //
    //   2. Focus is OUTSIDE this card root → `document.activeElement`
    //      is in a sibling card, the body, or off-document. This
    //      happens whenever a save fires for an INACTIVE card —
    //      `visibilitychange` (cmd-tab / app-hide), `beforeunload`
    //      (Developer > Reload), or a debounced save while the user
    //      is editing in another card. `captureFocus` would return
    //      `{ kind: "none" }` here too, but writing that into the
    //      bag would BLANK whatever focus was captured at the
    //      previous save (typically the deactivation-time capture
    //      that correctly named the input the user had focused).
    //      Per [L23], an internal save must not destroy a user-
    //      visible axis just because focus is momentarily elsewhere.
    //      Forward the previous bag's focus instead.
    //
    // The historical alternative was an [L03] focusin listener
    // (`lastFocusedPersistKeyRef`) feeding a fallback parameter to
    // `captureFocus`. The audit that retired it (commit 8914b519)
    // only checked activation-trigger save sources, all of which
    // fire in capture phase before focus moves; it missed the
    // inactive-card save sources covered by branch 2 above. The
    // assembler-local "preserve previous bag.focus" rule is
    // simpler — no listener, no ref, no extra capture pass — and
    // covers the same cases.
    //
    // Engine kind capture (content-owning cards). A content-owning
    // card whose focus rides in the engine's contenteditable
    // captures as `{ kind: "engine" }`. At this step the engine
    // still claims focus autonomously via `onCardActivated`, so the
    // capture rule remains: content-owning cards accept `bag.focus`
    // only when the kind is `dom` or `form-control` — i.e., a target
    // NOT owned by the engine — and otherwise leave `bag.focus`
    // absent so the engine's activation hook runs as the default.
