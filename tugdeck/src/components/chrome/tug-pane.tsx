/**
 * TugPane — pane chrome and frame: title bar, tabs, content area,
 * drag/resize, z-order, and responder integration.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Absolutely-positioned `.tug-pane` at position/size from `stackState`
 * - Title bar, accessory / tab bar, and content portal target
 * - Drag: RAF appearance-zone mutation during, `onCardMoved` commit on end
 * - Resize: 8 handles, clamped to min-size, `onCardMoved` on end
 *
 * Pane activation (bring-to-front on pointer-down) is driven by the
 * document-level capture-phase listener in `pane-focus-controller.ts`
 * — not by any React handler on this frame. The frame's own
 * `data-focused` attribute is also written by that module, not
 * rendered from a prop here.

            that is about the pane's PLACE rather than about the pane, and a
            control that reports where you are belongs at the head of the row it
            leads — read left to right, the cluster then says "one of two, and
            here is what you can do to it". Leading is also the only position
            that holds still: the badge comes and goes as cards stack, and each
            of the controls behind it can be absent on a given card, so a badge
            anywhere else in the row would sit at a different offset per card.

            The condition is `slotStack.length > 1` and nothing else — no
            "am I on top?" test, which would need a second cross-pane fact the
            title bar does not have. Every pane in the stack renders it,
            because the badge describes the PLACE and a pane the user can see
            is entitled to tell the truth about where it stands.

            What the user sees therefore depends on the arrangement. In a slot
            stack, or a stacked rail, occlusion hides the badge along with
            everything else on a fully-covered pane, so a same-width stack
            shows exactly one. In a SPLIT rail nothing is occluded, so both
            members show one — two badges saying the same true thing about the
            one rail they share, which is the honest reading rather than a
            duplicate.

            The badge is also the rail's gateway: its glyph states the mode,
            and its menu carries the verbs that change it. A slot stack has no
            such verbs and takes none of this. */}

  // on exit, unchanged. It comes first because that supersession is the whole

  // defensive only, since a rail can never be bullseyed. The placement is

  // horizontal edge it is already nearest. Overrides `left` alone: the
  // vertical run, the width, and the mode's other pins all stand, so the pane
  // slides straight out and straight back.
  //
  // THIS PANE'S SIDE IS READ FROM `modeStyle.left`, its ACTUAL resolved pin,
  // never from `position.x`. For an imposed pane the stored position is a
  // last-known value the imposer has long since superseded — a three-up deck
  // can have all three panes stored at nearly the same x while sitting left,
  // centre, and right on screen — so deciding from it sent every card out the
  // same side. `modeStyle.left` is a number for a free pane and the imposer's
  // `calc()` for a slotted one, and both compose here.
  //
  // THE LINE IT IS COMPARED AGAINST is the bullseyed pane's own former
  // centre, handed down in `bullseyeExit` — not the canvas centre. Panes left
  // of the bullseyed card leave leftward and panes right of it leave
  // rightward, so no pane ever crosses the card arriving at the middle. The
  // canvas centre was the first cut and it produced exactly that crossing:
  // bullseye the leftmost card of a three-up and the middle card, still left
  // of the canvas centre, slid left THROUGH it.
  //
  // The comparison itself stays in CSS rather than being resolved here: both
  // terms are length expressions over the live insets, and evaluating them at
  // render would mean measuring, which is the observation [L06] keeps out of
  // the geometry path. A clamp does it instead — the inner term is this
  // pane's centre minus that line, negative on one side and positive on the
  // other, and multiplying by a large number saturates it into one bound or
  // the other. The 1px bias breaks an exact tie toward the left, which would
  // otherwise resolve to 0 and leave the pane sitting on screen.
  //
  // BOTH BOUNDS PARK THE PANE JUST PAST ITS OWN EDGE — one gap beyond, not a
  // whole canvas away. That symmetry is about the MOTION, not the resting
  // place: the frame animates out on the FLIP settle, and a left bound of
  // `-100%` would send a left-leaving pane a full canvas-width further than a
  // right-leaving one travels, so the two would cross at visibly different
  // speeds over the same duration. Equal travel, equal read.
  //
  // The win over measuring: this re-resolves on a window resize for free,
  // like every other pin the imposer emits, and the right bound stays a
  // percentage — the form that lets the settle cross rather than cut ([D121]).
