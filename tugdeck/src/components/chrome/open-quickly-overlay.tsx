/**
 * open-quickly-overlay.tsx — the deck-global Open Quickly dialog.
 *
 * Mounted once at the deck level. It watches {@link getOpenQuicklyOpen}
 * ([L02] via `useSyncExternalStore`); while open it stands up a live
 * {@link FileTreeStore} against the real connection — the same file-search
 * backend the composer's `@` completion uses — and feeds its provider to a
 * {@link TugModalInputDialog}. Choosing a row opens that file through the one
 * {@link openFileInCard} entry point (so it also lands in Open Recent);
 * dismissing just closes the dialog.
 *
 * The search root is the frontmost card's project when one is bound. With
 * nothing bound — an empty deck, or a deck of picker-state cards — it is the
 * user's default project directory, acquired as a browse hold through
 * {@link acquireDefaultWorkspace} so tugcast will route FILETREE queries to
 * it. That acquisition is asynchronous: the dialog opens immediately with the
 * empty provider and fills in when it lands. A bound card never waits.
 *
 * The root is re-pointed from a {@link TugFileChooser} row above the input —
 * the same three-part path field the session picker's *Project path* uses, with
 * the frontmost binding, the default directory, and recent projects as its
 * seed. Re-scoping happens only when the field **settles** on something new:
 * a half-typed path is not a directory, and the combo box also settles on a
 * plain blur, so the changed-only guard is what keeps a Tab through the row
 * from costing a probe round trip and a bounced key view ([P09] of the
 * modal-input-dialog plan).
 *
 * The query passes through {@link parseFileLocationQuery} on its way to the
 * provider: `tug-list-view.tsx:123` searches for the path and opens on line
 * 123, and an absolute path inside the project collapses to the relative
 * form the index keys on.
 *
 * The FileTreeStore is built and torn down per open session: the inner
 * body mounts only while open, so its `useEffect` owns the store's
 * lifetime and no WebSocket subscription lingers when the dialog is closed.
 *
