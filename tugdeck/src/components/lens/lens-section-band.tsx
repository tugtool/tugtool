/**
 * lens-section-band.tsx — one Lens section: a band (glyph + title + live
 * collapsed-summary + fold chevron) over an internally-scrolling body.
 *
 * The band is a {@link BlockStrip} at `altitude="section"` ([P02]): the same
 * header-shell primitive the transcript tool-call header wears, one altitude
 * up — so the Lens sections and the transcript read as one component family.
 * The section keeps its own lensStore-driven collapse and conditional body
 * render; it is NOT a full `BlockChrome` (that would bridge two collapse
 * owners, see [Q01]).
 *
 * Every band is always visible: the Lens stack does not scroll — the section
 * is a flex band whose BODY scrolls internally when its content outgrows the
 * section's share of the height (the sizing lives in `lens-section-band.css`
 * / `lens-content.css`). No sticky pinning, no measured pin offsets.
 *
 * A `filterable` section carries a `TugFilterField` in its band's actions
 * cluster while expanded (`lens-filter-store` is the seam to the body's list —
 * see that module's docstring for why a store and not a delegate). The field is
 * live only while the section holds items: an empty section's filter is
 * disabled and out of the keyboard walk, read off the `populated` fact in
 * `lens-section-content` — never off the filtered count, which would disable
 * the field the moment a query narrowed to nothing.
 *
 * The band is itself a stop in the section's focus group, ahead of the filter
 * field, the section's own controls, and the fold chevron — which are stops too,
 * in the order they are read. So the arrow walk that runs down a section's rows
 * carries on into the next section's BAND, and folding a section is a keyboard
 * gesture: arrow to the band, Space. A collapsed section renders no body, so its
 * band and chevron are all it has — which is exactly what it takes to open it
 * again.
 *
 * On the band, Space FOLDS and Enter ENTERS. The two keys split because the band
 * stands for two things at once — the section's fold and its way in — and the
 * same split runs one level down, where a Cards group header takes Space as its
 * own fold. Space is the fold everywhere in the Lens; nothing has to remember
 * which level it is on.
 *
 * Clicking the band (anywhere except its buttons / the filter field) focuses
 * the section's list: it expands a collapsed section and lands the key view on
 * the section's focus group via a keyboard `place()`, so the band is a
 * one-click route to keyboard navigation of its items. DRAGGING the band
 * vertically carries the whole section to a new place in the stack — the band
 * is its own handle, so nothing is set aside at the right edge for one
 * ([P08]). The two gestures are told apart by travel, in `block-reorder`.
 *
 * Collapse is persisted via `lensStore.setCollapsed`; the expand/collapse
 * appearance is a `data-collapsed` attribute + CSS ([L06]). A collapsed
 * section renders its band's live `collapsedSummary` and hides its body.
 *
 * Laws: [L06] appearance via CSS + DOM attributes; [L02] collapse state
 * flows from `lensStore`; [L17]/[L20] the section sizes come from the
 * `data-altitude` token scale, not bespoke band CSS; [L19] file pair,
 * docstring, `data-slot`; [L22] the band-click focus goes through the
 * FocusManager (a keyboard `place()`), never a hand-rolled focus walk.

                band and the actions it precedes on screen, so the walk runs the
                band the way it reads: band → filter → controls → chevron →
                list. It is still never the ⌘L seed target, which addresses
                `<group>:0` by key — the list.

                A section with NO items disables its field: nothing to filter,
                so no caret and no Tab stop (`TugInput` declines to register a
                disabled stop, so the walk passes the whole band by). The gate
                is the UNFILTERED count and only ever that — a query that
                narrows to zero leaves the field live, because there it is the
                only way back ([R02]).

                The field is keyed on that flip so it remounts and re-seeds from
                the store, which the effect above clears while the section is
                empty; within a state it stays mounted, and it remounts per
                expand seeded the same way, so a query survives a collapse. */}
