/**
 * dashes-section.tsx — the Lens **Dashes** section: one row per inflight dash,
 * across every open project.
 *
 * The Lens is the account-global surface and `ChangesetAllStore` is the
 * account-global snapshot it already reads, so this section is a projection
 * and nothing more — no feed, no store of record, no second copy of anything.
 * Rows key on the dash's **owner key**, which makes two incarnations of a
 * reused name distinct for free.
 *
 * A dash reads in dash grammar here too — name, stage, and whether anyone is
 * on it — never in the grammar of a card or a file. A dash with live bound
 * sessions wears a phase dot; a dash with none wears the parked mark, which is
 * a quiet glyph rather than a dot, because "nobody is working this" is not a
 * state of work.
 *
 * **This is the roster, not the workbench.** The Cards section nests a dash
 * sub-row under the session working it — that is where a reader asks "what is
 * this session doing". This section answers the other question, account-
 * globally: what dashes exist, and which of them need attention. A worked dash
 * therefore appears in both places, and that is two surfaces answering two
 * questions rather than a duplication. It is also why this section is the one
 * that cannot be dropped: a **parked** dash has no session to nest under, and
 * every dash has to stay findable in the Lens.
 *
 * The per-session jump chips this row used to carry are gone for the same
 * reason: they were how you got TO the session working a dash, and the sub-row
 * is already there. The facts run — name, stage, steps, review mark — is shared
 * with that sub-row ({@link DashFactsRun}), so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * **Liveness is a leaf.** Phase lives on per-card `codeSessionStore` snapshots
 * that move on every transcript event; a row projection subscribed to that
 * would wake the whole section per event. So {@link DashPhaseDot} mounts the
 * subscription at the dot, the section's data pass never reads phase, and a
 * reducer wake repaints one glyph.
 *
 * Read-only, deliberately: the binding verbs live in the Changes shade, beside
 * the facts you would take a dash on for, and this row offers no join, no
 * release, and no adopt. It says what is true and gets out of the way.
 *
 * Rows are totally ordered ([P02]): worked before parked, then nearest-to-done
 * first, then by name. The first reading is the useful one that way, and the
 * order does not reshuffle when an unrelated branch is created.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the aggregate and the bindings enter React through
 * `useSyncExternalStore`; [L03] the section's content declaration is a
 * `useLayoutEffect`; [L06] the parked mark and the row's tone are CSS on DOM
 * attributes, never React state; [L11] row activation dispatches
 * `focus-session-card` rather than reaching into a card; [L13] the dot's
 * motion is the progress indicator's; [L19] rows compose `TugListView` /
 * `TugListRow` rather than hand-rolling list focus.
