/**
 * cards-session-cell.tsx — the session *monitor* row, as it appears for a
 * single-card session pane in the Lens's Cards section:
 *
 *   [dot] <session name>                         <slot layout>
 *   <description>
 *   <latest pulse line>                        <activity sparkline>
 *
 * The middle line is the agent's rolling description of the session, with the
 * session's creation date standing in until one is written — so the row is the
 * same height whatever the session is doing, and a deck with no model sees a row
 * that says something true rather than one that collapses. The standing-goal
 * level that used to sit here is gone: the description already says what the
 * session is for, and a goal beside it read as an echo.
 *
 * The name is the session identity's Line tier, resolved through
 * `useSessionIdentity` like every other identity surface. The row itself is
 * `TugSessionRow`, the shape the masthead and the new-session picker also wear:
 * how it divides a rail's width between the dot, the title, the slots, and the
 * activity with its tape is that component's decision, so what the gallery
 * approves is what the Lens wears, by construction rather than by two files
 * agreeing.
 *
 * The row carries `data-session-id` (which session this is) alongside the
 * uniform `data-lens-row-id` every pane row wears (the reorder's handle).
 *
 * Laws: [L02] every store enters React through `useSyncExternalStore`; [L06]
 * appearance (dot, sparkline) is CSS on engine attributes, never React state.
