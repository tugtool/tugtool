/**
 * cards-section.tsx — the Lens **Cards** section: a pane-first mirror of the
 * deck canvas. Every card on the deck has a row here, grouped by kind
 * (Sessions / Files / Tools).
 *
 * The list is two-level, and the second level is a fact of the deck's data
 * model rather than a folder the user opens:
 *
 *  - A **single-card pane** renders exactly the row its card has always had —
 *    the session monitor, the file row, a generic tool row. No chevron, no
 *    indent, nothing to expand. This is the invariant the section exists to
 *    honor: the overwhelmingly common case pays nothing for the rare one.
 *  - A **multi-card pane** renders one pane row with all of its cards as
 *    indented subrows beneath it, always visible. There is no per-pane fold
 *    state and there is not going to be one; a heavy stack is handled by
 *    collapsing its *group*.
 *
 * Group headers are cursorable rows, not `TugListView`'s inert `"header"`
 * role: the arrow walk reaches them and Enter/Space toggles that group's
 * collapse. That choice is what makes the cursor-seed rule below necessary. To
 * the mouse the header is the group's drag handle and the chevron is the only
 * thing that folds — travel tells the two apart, so a press that goes nowhere
 * does nothing.
 *
 * The list is one Tab stop in the Lens; arrows rove the movement cursor,
 * Enter/click fronts the row's card (`focus-session-card`). Two things carry,
 * both on the shared `useBlockReorder` FLIP: a pane row within its own group
 * (committing `cardsRowOrder`), and a whole GROUP by its header — the header
 * and every row under it move as one block (committing `cardsGroupOrder`).
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the deck, the open registries, the bindings, and the persisted
 * arrangement all enter React through `useSyncExternalStore`; [L06] cursor,
 * selection, and the header's collapsed look are CSS on DOM attributes, never
 * React state; [L19]/[L20] every row composes a real Tug primitive; [L22] the
 * FocusManager owns the cursor; [L24] selection is the list's.
