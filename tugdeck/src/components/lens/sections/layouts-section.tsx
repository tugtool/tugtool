/**
 * layouts-section.tsx — the Lens **Layout** section: the deck's layout picker.
 *
 * Every layout decision the deck has is made here, on four axes. **Cards** says
 * how the cards are arranged; **Card Width** says how wide they read; **Sidebar
 * positions** says which edge each sidebar card holds; and a **rail row** per
 * shared side says whether the cards on that side stack front-to-back or
 * divide it between them. All four write the deck's `imposition` record — so
 * "where is the Lens" and "how wide is a Session card" are layout questions
 * answered beside the other layout questions rather than in an app-wide
 * preference somewhere else.
 *
 * The sidebar controls are **registry-driven**: one Left/Right group per card
 * that registered `layoutRole: "sidebar"`, in registration order. A third
 * sidebar card appears here by registering, with nothing to add in this file.
 * The rail rows are derived the same way — a side gets one when the registry
 * assigns two or more sidebar cards to it, open or not. That is deliberately
 * not a live read of what is standing: this section reads no panes at all, and
 * a row gated on visible members would both disagree with the miniature drawn
 * directly above it and disappear at the moment a split side dropped to one
 * card, taking the only way to un-split it along.
 *
 * The Cards axis has no *off*. One-up is the quietest arrangement rather than
 * the absence of one — a single anchor, which a card occupies only by being put
 * there — so the deck always stands under an imposition and every row's slot
 * picker is live from the first frame.
 *
 * The section draws the deck **once**: the plan at the top states the current
 * answers as a heading, and under that heading stands a scale picture of the
 * deck ({@link LayoutMiniature}). Every control below is a compact segmented group
 * (`TugChoiceGroup`) that writes the plan. The picture-per-option idiom this
 * replaced spent a full deck drawing on every option and asked the eye to
 * diff them; here the options are words and numerals, and the *plan* is where
 * an option shows what it would do — resting a pointer on a segment, or
 * standing the movement cursor on it, swaps the plan for that option's
 * arrangement, drawn tentative (tinted blocks) rather than committed (filled).
 *
 * The previews are pre-rendered: React renders one hidden plan layer per
 * offerable option from the same store read as the committed layer, and the
 * hover/cursor handlers only toggle DOM attributes to choose which layer
 * shows. A preview is ephemeral appearance, so no React state is involved in
 * showing one ([L06]); the layers themselves are semantic data — drawings of
 * the store's candidate arrangements — and re-render when the store moves.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] the imposition record enters React through `useSyncExternalStore`
 * on the deck store; [L03] the section's content declaration is a
 * `useLayoutEffect`; [L06] preview visibility is DOM attributes toggled in
 * event handlers and a `MutationObserver`, never React state; [L11] every
 * control emits `selectValue` through the responder chain, which this section
 * turns into `set-imposition` / `set-content-width` / `set-sidebar-side` /
 * `set-rail-mode` dispatches; [L19] every control is a `TugChoiceGroup` and
 * every caption a `TugLabel`, composed rather than hand-rolled; [L30] the section never touches
 * the deck store — it goes through the command funnel like any other door.
