/**
 * block-reorder.ts — `useBlockReorder`, the FLIP drag lifecycle for Lens
 * section reordering ([P08], Spec S01).
 *
 * The whole row is the handle. There is no grip: a pointerdown anywhere on a
 * row that is not a control ARMS a drag, and travel past
 * {@link DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX} ENGAGES it. Below the threshold the gesture is
 * still a click, so a row keeps its click and its double-click; past it the
 * row is being carried. Distance is what tells the two apart, rather than
 * which pixels were pressed — which is what lets one surface answer to both.
 *
 * What carries is a **block**: every element matching {@link
 * UseBlockReorderOptions.selector} whose {@link UseBlockReorderOptions.kindAttr}
 * holds the same key. Usually that is one element — a section, a row. Where a
 * key names a contiguous RUN (the Cards section's group header plus every row
 * filed under it) the whole run lifts, shifts, and settles as one thing, which
 * is what makes a group draggable without the list needing a wrapper element to
 * hang the group off.
 *
 * Where a row's surface is ALSO a native drag source (a snippet's incipit,
 * dragged into a session prompt) the axis arbitrates as well: the list is a
 * column, so a vertical act is the carry and a horizontal one is the drag-out
 * (see `nativeDragSource`).
 *
 * The lifecycle, all DOM/CSS with a single store write on drop:
 *
 *  - **engage** ghosts the dragged `.lens-section`
 *    (`data-dragging` → opacity/scale/raised-z/`pointer-events:none`, the CSS
 *    lives in `lens-section-band.css`) and snapshots the visible order + each
 *    section's rect.
 *  - **pointermove** translates the dragged band to follow the pointer
 *    (inline `transform`, no transition — instant), computes the target index
 *    from the snapshotted midpoints, shifts the non-dragged siblings by the
 *    dragged's slot to close the vacated gap / open the target slot
 *    (`transition: transform ease`), and positions the `BlockDropCaret` in
 *    the opened gap.
 *  - **pointerup** commits `setSectionOrder` only if the index changed, then
 *    FLIPs every section from its pre-commit visual into its committed slot
 *    (measure → `flushSync(commit)` → measure → play from the old offset), so
 *    the band settles into place with no jump even though sections have
 *    unequal heights. An unchanged index (or Escape) eases back and commits
 *    nothing.
 *  - **Escape** aborts locally: the handler's own capture-phase keydown
 *    listener swallows the key (so the Lens `CANCEL_DIALOG` responder never
 *    sees it) and eases the drag back without committing.
 *
 * **The gesture ends before the settle plays.** Releasing the drag latch and
 * handing the keyboard back to what was set down (`landKeyboard` — a release
 * always, an Escape never) happen the moment the commit lands, and the settle
 * animates on top of an already-final state. The inverse — outcome waiting on
 * motion — is what let a drop in a window that was not in front leave the
 * surface latched forever: no frames, so no play, so no end of gesture.
 *
 * Motion is `TugAnimator`, not a frame loop and not a timer ([L13]): the
 * settle is multi-element coordination with a completion, which is exactly
 * what `group()` is for. `requestAnimationFrame` appears nowhere here —
 * the live drag writes its transform straight from the pointer event, which
 * IS the gesture-driven loop the law allows.
 *
 * No React state changes mid-drag — appearance is inline `transform` +
 * `data-*` + CSS transitions ([L06]/[L08]); the store commit and the
 * FocusManager group-order re-sync remain drop-time only ([L22], driven off
 * the store by the caller's order effect, which `flushSync` runs at drop).
