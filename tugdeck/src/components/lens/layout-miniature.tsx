/**
 * layout-miniature.tsx — a scale picture of the deck under one layout.
 *
 * The Layouts plan offers a picture rather than words: it draws the deck as it
 * would actually stand — the sidebars holding the sides the deck holds them
 * on, and the cards packed between them under the chosen N-up rule. Reading
 * the picture is recognizing the arrangement rather than decoding a label for
 * it, the idiom Windows 11's Snap Layouts established.
 *
 * Both edges can carry a rail and either can carry more than one card, because
 * the deck's own default stacks the Lens and Jots on the right. A stacked
 * rail's cards stand front-to-back, so the picture draws them as a stack of
 * paper — the ones behind peeking out at the top. A side the user has SPLIT is
 * a divided strip instead, because that is then the arrangement the deck
 * paints; the picture shows which of the two a side is standing under.
 *
 * The geometry is the allocator's settled state (see at0303): the cards tile
 * the band edge to edge with only the seam between them, and the rail absorbs
 * what the cards do not take. So the picture is drawn from the parts' own
 * widths — each card at its content-width preset, each occupied side at the
 * rail's nominal width — normalized to fill the frame. A wider preset thereby
 * reads as the cards claiming more of the deck from the rail, which is what
 * choosing it does; it never reads as gaps opening between cards, which is an
 * arrangement the settled deck does not hold.
 *
 * Purely presentational: props in, CSS out, no store reads and no state ([L06]).
 * The live rails are passed down by the section so every drawing flips
 * together when a side changes.
