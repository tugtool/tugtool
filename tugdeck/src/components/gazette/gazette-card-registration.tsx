/**
 * gazette-card-registration.tsx — registers the Gazette card ([L25]).
 *
 * The Gazette is an ordinary registered card hosted by the normal `CardHost`
 * inside a sidebar pane, exactly as Jots and the Lens are: the pane/card
 * machinery (FocusContext, responder scope, title-bar chrome, the [L12]
 * selection boundary `CardHost` registers per card) is what makes focus restore
 * and the rail's own affordances nearly free.
 *
 * INVARIANT: `registerGazetteCard()` MUST run at boot unconditionally and
 * before the deck restores its layout — `filterRegisteredCards` drops panes
 * whose only card's componentId is unregistered at load, so a gated Gazette
 * card would evaporate its rail on every reload.
 *
 * `family: "gazette"` (a family no free pane's `acceptsFamilies` lists) plus
 * `acceptsFamilies: []` makes the card un-mergeable in both directions.
 *
 * @module components/gazette/gazette-card-registration
