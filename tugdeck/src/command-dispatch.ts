/**
 * command-dispatch.ts — funnel #1: the one front door every command goes
 * through.
 *
 * A command can arrive from a Swift menu item's control frame, a chord, a
 * button, or a slash bridge. Each of those resolves a command id and calls
 * `dispatchCommand`; the mechanism that carries it to its implementation is
 * read from the registry entry's `routing` field rather than chosen at the
 * call site ([P04]).
 *
 * ## Validation gates doors, not dispatch
 *
 * `validateCommand` answers whether a command is applicable right now, and
 * its consumers are the surfaces that show a command: the native menu's
 * enablement mirror, buttons, context menus. `dispatchCommand` does not
 * consult it — the responder that would perform the command is the thing
 * that decides what happens, and a command nobody handles is already a
 * silent no-op at the end of the chain walk. This is Cocoa's split:
 * `validateUserInterfaceItem:` dims the door; `sendAction:` just sends.

 * 2. The caller's `value` — what a chain-native caller sends, and the shape
 *    a context-menu item or a button uses.
 * 3. The caller's remaining fields — what a **control frame** sends. The
 *    host's `sendControl(action, params:)` puts its parameters at the top
 *    level of the frame (`{ action: "focus-pane", paneId: "p1" }`), because
 *    that is the wire the registered handlers were written against. A
 *    command that has since moved onto a responder still has to receive
 *    them, so the frame's own fields become the value rather than being
 *    dropped on the floor.

 * handler reading it back would be reading its own name.
