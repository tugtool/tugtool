/**
 * focus-ring-modality-store.ts -- the app-wide focus-ring modality.
 *
 * Two policies, orthogonal to the keyboard-access mode:
 *   - `keyboard` (the default): the focus ring moves with keyboard navigation
 *     only (Tab / Shift-Tab / surface entry).
 *   - `pointer`: the ring *also* follows pointer-driven key-view changes -- a
 *     click that lands on a registered focusable paints the ring -- so the ring
 *     is consistent whether you Tab to a control or click it.
 *
 * Unlike the keyboard-access mode, this is read by *non-rendering* code only
 * (the FocusManager's ring projection) -- no CSS consumes it, so the store does
 * NOT stamp a DOM attribute. It enters React through `useSyncExternalStore`
 * only ([L02]) for the dev-panel Settings toggle's displayed state; the actual
 * ring repaint is driven through the manager, which mutates the
 * `data-key-view-kbd` appearance attribute directly ([L06]/[L22]).
 *
 * Persistence rides tugbank defaults (`dev.tugtool.app` / `focusRingModality`),
 * the same feed as the theme and keyboard-access mode; there is no
 * `localStorage`. Boot seeds the store from the DEFAULTS snapshot via
 * `initialize`; a live remote write arrives through the DEFAULTS push and is
 * applied with `setMode(..., { persist: false })` to avoid an echo loop. The
 * FocusManager is kept in sync by the responder-chain provider, which
 * subscribes here and pushes the policy into the manager.
