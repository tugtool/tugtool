/**
 * Every geometry write releases the pane it names from bullseye.
 *
 * The rule is stated over WHAT CHANGED, not over which caller changed it:
 * a gesture saying "this pane is exactly this wide, here" and a posture
 * saying "this pane is comfy, centered" cannot both be true, and the
 * explicit gesture wins. `DeckManager._clearBullseyeFor` is its one
 * implementation, and three paths write a pane's `position`, `size`, or
 * `slot`:
 *
 *   - `movePane` — the drag and resize commits, AND every width door, which
 *     reaches it through `_setPaneWidth`. Gated on the `positionChanged ||
 *     sizeChanged` locals it already computes, deliberately not on
 *     `evictSlot`: the width doors never pass that flag, so a gate on it
 *     would miss all of them.
 *   - `setContentWidth` — builds its pane array inline for `_commitImposition`,
 *     bypassing `movePane` entirely.
 *   - `assignCardToSlot` — writes `slot` on its own path.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TEST CATCHES: a clear being dropped from one of the three, and
 * a fourth call site appearing without this file being updated to say why.
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT: a brand-new geometry mutator written with no clear at
 * all — no source grep can see the absence of a call it was never told to
 * expect. The behavioral half is `at0372-bullseye.test.ts`, which drives
 * every exit door through the real app and the real store.
 *
 * A source guard rather than a `DeckManager` suite because the constructor
 * calls `createRoot(container)`: there is no DOM substrate under `bun test`
 * (happy-dom is deleted, jsdom render tests are banned), and hand-rolling a
 * mock store to count method calls is the other banned shape.
