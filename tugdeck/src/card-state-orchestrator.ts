/**
 * CardStateOrchestrator — the framework's single entry point for
 * capturing a card's full state bag ([D13], [A9c]).
 *
 * Before this module, every save trigger (will-phase subscribers,
 * close-before-destroy flush, `saveState` RPC) dispatched to a card's
 * own save callback ad hoc. Each callback built its own bag from
 * framework-owned axes; component-level state had no place to land.
 * The orchestrator routes every trigger through a single call:
 *
 *   - `captureCardState(cardId)` — invokes the card's registered
 *     assembler (framework axes + `bag.content`) and walks the per-card
 *     `ComponentStatePreservationRegistry` parent-first, merging
 *     harvested component state into `bag.components`.
 *
 * Restore is NOT the orchestrator's responsibility. After Phase E.8,
 * components mount in their saved state via `useSavedComponentState`
 * inside a `useState` initializer; imperative renderers (TerminalBlock's
 * virtualized scroller, FileBlock's CM6 mount) read saved scroll via
 * `useSavedRegionScroll` and write it at creation. The orchestrator is
 * capture-only.
 *
 * An **assembler** is the per-card capture closure CardHost supplies —
 * the code that today lives in `saveCurrentCardStateRef.current` but
 * without the `store.setCardState` write and without `bag.components`.
 * Registering it with the orchestrator is the moral equivalent of
 * `registerSaveCallback`: the orchestrator owns the reference so any
 * trigger can invoke the assembler's `capture()` uniformly.
 *
 * The orchestrator is instance-scoped (not a module-level singleton)
 * so tests can construct their own without polluting other tests, and
 * DeckManager owns the production instance.
