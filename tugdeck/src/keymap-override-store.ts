/**
 * keymap-override-store.ts — the user's own keyboard, persisted.
 *
 * The command registry states a default binding list per command. This store
 * holds the *overrides*: one tugbank key per command id, whose value is the
 * binding list that command should have instead. The keymap registry is where
 * the two meet — an override wins for its command and nothing else changes.
 *
 * Three states, and the middle one is the reason this is a store rather than
 * a blob ([P14]):
 *
 * - **Absent** — the command uses the table's default.
 * - **A list** — the command uses this list.
 * - **An empty list** — the command is *deliberately unbound*. Distinct from
 *   absent, and the distinction is durable: "I do not want a chord for this"
 *   is an answer, and reset-to-default has to be able to take it back.
 *
 * A write that matches the command's shipped bindings collapses to the first
 * state rather than becoming the second. Setting a chord back to the default
 * is not a change to remember — it is the undoing of one — and a store that
 * remembered it would leave the command flagged as overridden with nothing to
 * revert to.
 *
 * Per-command keys are what make reset a deletion rather than a rewrite, and
 * keep one command's change from racing another's — a single blob value would
 * make every rebind a read-modify-write of the whole keymap.
 *
 * Persistence rides tugbank defaults (`dev.tugtool.keymap`), the same feed as
 * the theme; there is no `localStorage`. Boot seeds from
 * the DEFAULTS snapshot before `initHostMenuState`, because the host reads
 * chords off the first menu-state push. A remote write arrives through the
 * DEFAULTS push and is applied with `persist: false` to avoid an echo loop.
 *
 * Laws: [L02] subscribable store; [L24] structure-zone state, read by
 * non-rendering code (the keymap registry, the menu-state publisher) as well
 * as by the Settings pane.
