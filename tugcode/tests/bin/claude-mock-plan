# Mock claude CLI for tugtool tugplan command integration tests.
# Simulates different agent responses based on prompts for testing the planning loop.
#
# Behavior controlled by environment variables:
#   TUG_CLAUDE_MOCK_PLAN_STATE - State file to track invocation count
#   TUG_CLAUDE_MOCK_PLAN_ABORT - If "true", simulate user abort
#   TUG_CLAUDE_MOCK_PLAN_REVISE_COUNT - Number of revision loops before approval (default: 0)
#
# The mock inspects the prompt (last positional argument) to determine which agent is being invoked
# and returns appropriate responses to drive the planning loop.

- Feature works as expected

#### Scope {#scope}

1. Basic feature implementation
2. Unit tests

#### Non-goals (Explicitly out of scope) {#non-goals}

- Production deployment

#### Dependencies / Prerequisites {#dependencies}

- None

#### Constraints {#constraints}

- Must be simple

#### Assumptions {#assumptions}

- Tests will be run in CI
