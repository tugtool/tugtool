/**
 * subagent-tail.ts — live poll-tailer for a background agent's
 * out-of-band transcript.
 *
 * When Claude Code launches an `Agent` with `run_in_background: true`,
 * the agent's child tool calls and final answer are written to a
 * live-growing JSONL file (`tasks/<agentId>.output`, the `outputFile`
 * path carried by the async-launch echo) — never to the parent
 * session's stream. This module tails that file from a byte offset and
 * re-emits each newly-appended entry as the same `parent_tool_use_id`
 * child frames the resume splice synthesizes
 * (`synthesizeSubagentChildFrames`), so live and reload converge on
 * byte-identical frame shapes.
 *
 * Mechanics:
 *  - **Poll, don't watch.** `fs.watch` is unreliable for file appends
 *    on macOS; the tailer reads from a persisted byte offset on an
 *    interval (default ~250 ms).
 *  - **Complete lines only.** Bytes after the last newline are carried
 *    as a pending remainder across polls (as raw bytes, so a UTF-8
 *    code point split at the read boundary never mis-decodes); the
 *    offset advances past everything read, and only fully-terminated
 *    lines are parsed and emitted.
 *  - **Compose on genuine completion only.** The parent Agent's
 *    `tool_use_structured` (final answer + footer stats, via
 *    `composeAgentStructuredResult`) is emitted exactly once, from
 *    `stop(finalFlush = true)` — never mid-stream, so an intermediate
 *    "let me…" line is never surfaced as the answer.
 *  - **Best-effort everywhere.** A missing file is a no-op, a
 *    malformed line is skipped, and no code path throws into the
 *    caller — the session's stdout drain must never die because a
 *    background agent's file misbehaved.
 *
 * On a deck reconnect the owning session calls `resetForReplay()` so
 * the tailer re-streams the full child set from offset 0 into the
 * re-hydrated job; the deck's id-keyed dedup absorbs the overlap with
 * the replay's turn-attached children.
 *
