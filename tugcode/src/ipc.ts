/**
 * Promise-chain tail that serializes every `Bun.write` to stdout.
 *
 * **Why this is required.** `Bun.write(Bun.stdout, ...)` is async,
 * and a single message larger than the OS pipe buffer (~64 KiB on
 * macOS, ~64 KiB on Linux) is written via multiple `write(2)`
 * syscalls under the hood. Concurrent `writeLine` calls that each
 * exceed the pipe buffer can therefore **interleave** at the syscall
 * level: bytes from message B land in the middle of message A's
 * stdout output. Tugcast's `BufReader::lines()` then reads a
 * `\n`-terminated unit that's a corrupted concatenation, and the
 * downstream `splice_tug_session_id` / `Frame::new` produces a wire
 * frame whose header length is consistent with the corrupted line
 * but whose payload doesn't parse as JSON on the browser side.
 *
 * The replay path is where this surfaces — it emits frames in rapid
 * succession (per-JSONL-entry), and an image-bearing
 * `add_user_message` is large enough to trigger multi-syscall
 * splitting. Pre-Step-5c, image attachments were always small
 * because they were nested in JSON content blocks already; the same
 * corruption would have been latent then but hidden by the
 * already-small frame sizes. Post-Step-5c the wire shape moves
 * image bytes through CODE_OUTPUT during replay (the `content`
 * array carries the image inline), so the threshold gets crossed
 * routinely.
 *
 * The fix: maintain a single `Promise` tail; every `writeLine` awaits
 * the prior tail before issuing its own `Bun.write`, and updates the
 * tail to its own completion. The chain is fire-and-forget at the
 * call site — callers never see the promise — but the writes
 * themselves are strictly ordered. Cost is one closure + microtask
 * per `writeLine`; the underlying `write(2)` syscall sequence
 * matches the call sequence on a per-message granularity.
 *
 * `writeLineAndExit` continues to await directly because it needs
 * the bytes flushed before `process.exit` is called; it slots into
 * the same tail so its emission is also serialized with prior
 * `writeLine` calls.

 *
 * Production callers don't normally need this — `writeLine` is
 * fire-and-forget by design — but a flush point is useful at clean

 * `writeLine(...); process.exit(...)` races the async write against
 * the exit and silently drops the frame.
