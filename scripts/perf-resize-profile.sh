# perf-resize-profile — measure what the deck's renderer does per frame.
#
# Two modes:
#
#   resize (default)  drive a paced window resize while sampling
#   idle              sample a still window
#
# The verdict is main-thread busy share plus the sample counts of the
# frames that matter for motion residency: keyframe blending inside
# style resolution, and the compositing-requirements walk it triggers.
# An animation that cannot be accelerated shows up as nonzero
# applyKeyframeEffects at steady state.
#
# Usage: perf-resize-profile.sh <bundle-id> [idle|resize] [seconds]
#
# The bundle id selects which app's renderer to sample: WebContent runs
# as a launchd-owned XPC service, so it carries no parent link back to
# the app. What it does carry is the app's WebKit cache directory
# (~/Library/Caches/<bundle-id>/WebKit), open for the process's whole
# life — that is the identifying handle this script matches on.
