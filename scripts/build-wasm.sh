#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# build-wasm.sh — Build every WASM crate under tugdeck/crates/ in
# release mode via wasm-pack, then normalize the per-crate `pkg/`
# auto-generated `.gitignore` so the built artifacts can be tracked
# without `git add -f`.
#
# ## Why this exists
#
# wasm-pack writes a `pkg/.gitignore` containing `**` after every
# build. We want the artifacts checked in (so contributors do not
# need wasm-pack installed for `bun run dev` and so the macOS app
# build phase doesn't need a Rust toolchain). The wasm-pack default
# fights that policy. This script overwrites the auto-generated file
# with an empty one after each build, restoring our convention.
#
# ## Discovery
#
# All crates are auto-discovered by globbing for `Cargo.toml` files
# one directory below `tugdeck/crates/`. Adding a new WASM crate
# (e.g. for a future ANSI parser) requires zero edits here — drop
# the crate next to its peers, ensure it's a member of
# `tugdeck/crates/Cargo.toml`, and the next `just wasm` picks it up.
#
# ## Failure modes
#
# - wasm-pack missing: prints an actionable message and exits 1.
# - A crate's wasm-pack build failure: propagates the non-zero exit.
# - No crates discovered: exits 0 with a notice (treated as a no-op).
