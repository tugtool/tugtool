/// Per-instance identity and path helpers — Swift mirror of
/// `tugcore::instance` on the Rust side.
///
/// Every long-lived per-instance resource (tugbank DB, session
/// ledger, notify socket, log directory, bundle-path marker) derives
/// its path from a single identifier — `instanceId`. At runtime Swift
/// owns the computation: it resolves the identity from `BuildInfo`
/// (which read it from Info.plist at first access) and propagates it
/// to every spawned child via the `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` environment
/// variable (per [D12]).
///
/// A harness override is supported: setting `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` in the
/// app's environment before launch makes `InstanceConfig` use that
/// value instead of `BuildInfo.instanceId`. The override exists so
/// test rigs can construct synthetic identities pointing at temp
/// data dirs without rebuilding the bundle.
///
/// The override is **gated on the app-test harness marker**
/// (`TUGAPP_TEST_SOCKET`), and deliberately so. Every running Tug
/// instance exports its own `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` into the environment of
/// its tugcast child, which propagates it to every Session-card shell (see
/// `ProcessManager.startProcess`). `open` then propagates the caller's
/// environment to whatever app it launches — so a `just app-debug`
/// run from inside a release-main Session card would otherwise launch a
/// brand-new worktree/debug bundle that silently adopts `release-main`,
/// colliding with the very instance that spawned it (exit-73, the
/// "Another release-main instance is already running" dialog). A built
/// bundle's identity is its OWN baked-in `BuildInfo.instanceId`; an
/// inherited `TUG_INSTANCE_ID` is honored only when the app-test
/// harness is genuinely driving the launch — which it signals with
/// `TUGAPP_TEST_SOCKET` (set on every harness launch, passed via
/// `open --env`). The tugcast integration-test harness scrubs the same
/// vars on its side (`tugcast/tests/common/mod.rs`).
///
/// References: roadmap/tug-multi-instance.md [D04] [D05] [D12].
