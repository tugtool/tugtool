/// Tug's logs live in the per-instance `Logs/` directory
/// (`InstanceConfig.logDir`), and until now only the Rust side could write
/// there: `NSLog` goes to Console, which is not where anyone reads Tug's logs
/// and not where `just logs-debug` looks. This writes `tugapp.log.<UTC-date>`
/// into that directory, so one command shows the whole system and one parser
/// reads both halves of it.
///
/// It is a **separate file** rather than an append to `tugcast.log.*` because
/// tugcast's `tracing_appender` owns that file's rotation and buffering; a
/// second process writing into it would race the rotation. Same directory,
/// same format, same UTC rolling boundary makes the two files one log for
/// reading purposes without making them one file for writing purposes.
///
/// The facility is general. Local-model instrumentation is its first client,
/// not its subject — the app's existing `NSLog` call sites are free to move
/// here.
///
/// Writes are serialized on a private queue and dispatched asynchronously, so
/// no caller ever waits on file I/O. A crash can therefore lose the last few
/// lines; that is the trade for never putting a file write on a latency path.
